Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.Development of Your ThesisA thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement.Strong FormA good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement.StyleJust as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice.ConventionsConventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such asSupport and ReferencesFinally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources,The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider. Focus on improving your essays’ overall structure—the thesis development, form, style, conventions, and support.

I prepared well but the course had long formulae which had to be remembered. So I prepared well for the exam and tried my best to remember the formulae. I was not sure whether it was an open book exam( Open book exams are where students can bring as many text books or note books for the exams. Generally, whenever the course contains long formulae and lots of theory, professors used to set open book exams).I enter the exam hall and find quite a few students have already started the exam while referring the text books. Thanking god for the open book nature of the exam, I took the question paper and started to write the exam which was for an hour. Half an hour passed and the Invigilator comes to me and saysInvigilator: Is it an open book exam?Me: Yes sir. ( Confident that lot of other people in the hall were also using the text books/notes)Another 15 min pass and Invigilator again comes to me.Invigilator: Are you sure it is an open book exam?Me: ( This time a little puzzled as to why he was asking the same question, again.) Yes sir.Invigilator: I don't think so.It did not strike me for a few seconds what was just happening. Finally I realized that it indeed was not an open book exam and all through the exam I was openly COPYING, with about 10 min left in the exam. The students who were going through text books belonged to another course.The next ten minutes I faced the ultimate dilemma of whether I should continue writing or should I just stop writing and give it up there.This was one of my crazy stories.P.S: Later, I met the prof and apologized and luckily he conducted a re-exam for just me alone. That was a different experience all together.

6,"Here are five things that stand out from nearly ten years working in the strategy consulting industry#1 Epistemic humilityAccording to Socrates, wisdom was the admission that you are not wise. To the outside, one may think that the default stance in consulting is for young consultants to pretend they know everything.However in consulting, successful consultants adopt the general sense that you areHere are five things that stand out from nearly ten years working in the strategy consulting industry#1 Epistemic humilityAccording to Socrates, wisdom was the admission that you are not wise. To the outside, one may think that the default stance in consulting is for young consultants to pretend they know everything.However in consulting, successful consultants adopt the general sense that you are likely to be wrong…a lot. You will discover new solutions, insights or mental models if you are too attached to certain ways of thinking about things. Everything in consulting is framed as a hypothesis. While there is an issues with confirmation bias (no one is immune), the orientation of any project is to state a hypothesis and then go about “proving” or disproving what you have stated.#2 Comfort with uncertaintyThe first six months working in consulting can be traumatic for some consultants who have a desire for control and certainty. They have to shift from clearly defined assignments and 10-page double-spaced papers to the broad and hard to understand problems that consulting firms are brought in to solve.The only way to develop a comfort with uncertainty is to experience the uncertainty - over and over again. The experienced consultant develops a deeper understanding of what comes next. They “just know” that they are on the right path. By working on many projects, exploring new topics with limited understanding, knowing how to react to roadblocks and helping business leaders take action on formerly intractable issues, they develop both a confidence that they can figure things out and an ability to sit with the uncertainty on a day-to-day basis.Many conflicts in consulting teams emerge because of varying levels of anxiety about the state of the project. A typical conflict is when a Partner doesn’t feel that the project is heading in the right direction and starts to put pressure on the project leader to push the team further. That project leader’s own capacity and comfort with uncertainty can make all the difference on whether or not he and his team are able to manage the tension or self-combust into conflct.As one progresses in their roles at a consulting firm from associate to project leader to principal to partner, the consultant faces higher levels of uncertainty and challenges. The ability to develop a capacity for handling this uncertainty makes all the difference between an effective consultant and one who decides to escape the industry.#3 SynthesisSynthesis is something that a lot of junior consultant seemingly understand quickly - probably within 2–3 months of joining a consulting firm. However, it often takes several years for consultants to master these skills.In consulting they call this the “so what?” meaning you are able to absorb an enormous amount of information and then communicate to your audience what they should think about it. The more complex the inputs, the harder this is to do. At a simple level, if you see a company with three products and all have increased in sales for the last twelve months, you can synthesize that the company is doing well reaching new customers.However, if you are working with a company with 100 product lines across 50 countries and with different marketing and distribution channels in each country, you can start to see how it is hard to synthesis clear takeaways from any information you have on last year’s sales.One approach to deal with this is to generate a list of all of the data points you have and then start to group them, giving each group a temporary label that summarizes the information. You then would shift things around many times, adding some data that might be missing and eliminating data that doesn’t really help you get to the “point.” Eventually you’ll have a couple of groups with clear common themes or even one central idea that ties everything together.Synthesis is more art than a simple set of steps to follow and there is often no “right” answer. I teach a consulting skills course where students have to synthesize information from a mock company in the form of quotes, interviews and survey data. I’ve received many good answers that synthesizing information is very different ways.#4 Structured Writing SkillsThe best consultants are great writers. Writing forces the consultant to come face to face with their own arguments. When you are writing out your arguments it is much easier to call BS on yourself that one might while looking at a PowerPoint presentation. While writing (more specifically “memos”) was once the center of consulting work firms did (businesses often operated through “memos”) a lot of this has eroded in the past twenty years as firms have leaned more heavily on analytics and PowerPoint presentations.When I started at McKinsey one of our first “assignments” in training was to develop a structured memo synthesizing information from 5–10 articles on any topic we wanted to research. That was transformative. Compared to the kinds of writing I did in the business and engineering schools, the feedback was non-stop and constantly pushed me to better structure my ideas and more clearly communicate what I was trying to say. This iterative feedback helps many consultants become better writers.Many remote companies are shifting back towards writing as a central way of communication because they realize tha...","86,850 followers",Ellen Vrana,787,457,19.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-Virtual-University-degree-in-Pakistan

Some examples of intellectual benefits of education include: critical thinking, self management or independence, project management skills and research skills.So let's get into each benefit one by one. Firstly, critical thinking. Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action. There are 5 critical thinking skills which are: analysis, Interpretation, inference, open mindedness and problem solving. All these can be mastered by a students in school as he or she is given tests assignments and has to solve the problems.Furthermore, there is self management. Self-management, which is also referred to as “self-control” and is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behaviors effectively in different situations. Self management skills helps one to be employable after studies as It helps one to be more productive in a workplace. Students learn this skills when they train how to manage time in studies, mainly examination tests.Next we'll look at project management skills. These are the core abilities that are necessary to successfully bring a project from start to finish. Here we will look at higher education in India. There is Edoofa education for all, where students are taughts project skills through the Earn While You Learn program. These skills will help students in their studies.Finally we look at research skills. Research skills refer to the ability to search for, locate, extract, organise, evaluate and use or present information that is relevant to a particular topic. Edoofa is a great way to earn research skills as they have Earn While You Learn program, where students get tge opportunity to research and present work.In conclusion i think education for all is a best way to get intellectual benefits of education which are far beyond subject matter expertise as everyone has the chance to get all benefits of education.

I could give her lots of freedom to choose those assignments.The standards tell me (and her) what skills she needs to have and at what level she needs to show me she can meet those standards.Now, let’s sayWhat happens to her education when she gets to North Carolina, and all of the sudden, the standards are allShe gets to school and finds out that in Wisconsin, she had to do geometry and algebra by the end of her sophomore year, but in North Carolina, she’s already supposed to have had trigonometry her sophomore year and her junior year, she’s supposed to do geometry, which she just took. She hasn’t taken trig yet. Does she get stuck with a bunch of sophomores in her new school when she’s a junior? Does she repeat geometry?What if North Carolina’s standards figure she’s supposed to have mastered a whole bunch of skills and concepts that Wisconsin doesn’t even have in their standards at all?And what if Wisconsin’s standards are aligned with local businesses and colleges, but North Carolina’s haven’t been revamped in twenty years and don’t address things like basic computer literacy?That’s a problem, right?That’s precisely where the Common Core Initiative came into play in the early 2000’s.A little history lesson is in order.In 2001, Congress re-authorized and amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or ESEA. You’ll better know that re-authorization as No Child Left Behind. (NCLB was replaced in 2016 with another re-authorization of the ESEA called the Every Student Succeeds Act.)One of the key focuses of NCLB was that it massively expanded the amount of data gathered by schools, through testing and through other means. This was compiled by the federal government and state governments, and was supposed to help teachers identify areas of proficiency and weakness for students. It tied funding to standardized testing, and required schools to make an adequate yearly progress (AYP) goal. Failure to meet the AYP meant massive loss of funds.But it also left all that testing development up to the states, and left it to the states to set their AYP goals.And it said nothing about standards. States could (and did) have wildly varying standards. Maryland required teaching trigonometry. Neighboring Virginia didn’t.A number of organizations were formed to help make sense of this sudden treasure trove of data. One of these was the Grow Network, founded by Rhodes Scholars David Coleman and Jason Zimba.One of the key problems they ran into was how to compare various states when the standards were completely different. Another key problem was that all of this data was still essentially useless in helping schools figure out how to get students successful for college and career readiness in the 21st century.The last major push to create standards had taken place in the lateAnd those standards were often so expansive that no teacher could possibly address all of them in a single year. So, teachers often had to pick and choose which ones to address, and had to focus on hitting as many as possible at relatively shallow levels of proficiency, rather than requiring deeper mastery of fewer essential standards.The standards also tended to be rather vague. The Wisconsin Model Academic Standards were still in use when I was in undergrad. We spent several weeks of one of my courses during my Methods of Teaching semester (five classes taken simultaneously that had an intensive focus on how teach secondary ELA,) on just how to break down the standards and turn them into usable guidance.Coleman and Zimba aimed to fix all that.Their goal? Work with business and college leaders, educators, administrators,They started the Common Core State Standards Initiative in 2008, laying out an ambitious plan in an essay to the Carnegie Corporation forThey wanted to focus on real-world applications of literature, math, and science, and bake those right into the standards. What would the students have to do in college and careers? That was what should be in the standards.Coleman and Zimba found thatJeb Bush made it a central push of his education plan in Florida. Mike Huckabee was an early supporter and championed the standards as a way to improve education nationwide.Even the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s largest teachers’ union, jumped on board and hailed the effort as “essential building blocks for a better education system.”Honestly, this looked like one of the first times whenSeriously, when was the last time the American Federation of Teachers and Mike Huckabee were on the same side ofThe people working on the initiative were hopeful that they could maybe get a dozen to fifteen states to sign on initially, if they were really lucky. They expected more like ten.More thanArne Duncan, the Secretary of Education for the Obama Administration at the time, saw this as a golden opportunity to improve the failings of No Child Left Behind while working on a replacement law, and got Congress to authorize a big pot of money and No Child Left Behind waivers for states willing to adopt any set of new, updated standards that even resembled the new proposed Common Core. All but two of the remaining holdouts (Rick Perry in Texas, and Sarah Palin in Alaska) jumped on board to get the federal dollars and NCLB waivers.So, from 2008–2011, the Initiative worked to create draft standards, starting with mathematics and English/Language Arts. This was not done in secret or behind closed doors, but the nation kind of had some other things dominating the news cycles at the time.And in the meanwhile, the Tea Party,So, when states started enacting the new standards in 2011 and lots of federal dollars went to it, Tea Party RepublicansInsane conspiracy theories spread like wildfire about these new standards, which from the Tea Party’s perspective seemed to apparently just arise from nowhere. They must be a secret George Soros project to indoctrinate children with liberal, progressive values! Any wacky or ill-conceived assignment became examples of “Common Core Curriculum.” (Again, remember - the standards don’t require of me as a teacherThis literally became the issue that in 2012 unseated one of the most conservative Representatives in the House at the time, Eric Cantor of Virginia, who supported the standards.And that’s where we are today.I headed up CCSS implementation in several districts from 2012–2014. We spent a lot of time with our local CESA district (a regional school support organization in Wisconsin,) working on constructing curricula around the new standards.The first good thing about them is that there are simply fewer standards, and just make more sense than the old standards. They’re more workable and clear.For example,B.12.2 Plan, revise, edit, and publish clear and effective writingNow,CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.11-12.5Develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach, focusing on addressing what is most significant for a specific purpose and audience. (Editing for conventions should demonstrate command of Language standards 1-3 up to and including grades 11-12 here.)The new standards for ELA (English/Language Arts) are bundled differently, but cover essentially all of the same ground. For example, the WMAS standard requires timed writing. The CCSS also require timed writing, but in a different standard section.The CCSS advance every year until high school, and then 9–10 and 11–12 are joined, unlike the WMAS, which advanced every four years (in conjunction with the grades when students were required to take the standardized tests.) The CCSS build skills more progressively and provide a clearer, more incremental road map for students and teachers to follow as a result.The language is clear enough that with minor modification, I was able to make them into learning targets specifically for my students and their parents to have for each unit, so they could see precisely what we were supposed to be learning and at what level they were expected to do it.Our department replaced a few older texts with newer ones and shifted a few around.We added a sweet biotech research unit to the sophomore curriculum. The students got to debate the Bill of Rights in their junior year.All of that met the new Core Standards. None of that content was mandated by them.One difference in the new standards was a push for more “informational literacy,” not just non-fiction, but texts like scientific or technical writing: the kinds of things students might see in a college or workplace setting. This was designed to be spread out over the entire core disciplinary areas; ELA would be integrated into science, mathematics, social studies. Students would finally see how content areas and disciplines overlapped, particularly literacy and writing.This was a big part of my job when I taught, heading up cross-disciplinary literacy integration around the district. I worked with elementary and secondary educators to incorporate reading and writing skills as part of their science, mathematics, social studies, history, even art and music coursework. Students got used to seeing standardized writing rubrics across all their classes.This was not originally welcomed with open arms by my colleagues, who were afraid it would add to their already overflowing plates. But, with a little help, it didn’t take long before most of my colleagues saw the value in it and I tried to make it as little extra effort as possible to augment their existing work without just creating more of it. Most of that work centered around providing standardized writing rubrics, having the other educators reinforce what we were already teaching in the ELA classroom, and making sure the students used the same reading strategies everywhere.This has already led to improved results across the board. When students are able to apply the same reading, research, and writing skills from ELA in the STEM classrooms and social sciences, their ability to digest and retain that information is greater. They have a greater understanding how to pick apart a technical manual or draft an effective lab report that others can understand. When their ability to communicate effectively improves, so does their ability to more rapidly pick up other skills and content knowledge. It’s a positive snowball effect that promotes good, lifelong learners.That’s one of those new concepts that came with Common Core. Educational researchers had been telling us this for a long time. The new standards made it part of the classroom.The Standards are just a good way for all of the various states to be on the same page for all of our students, and to have 21st century standards that will prepare our students better for life outside of elementary and secondary education.They are not scary. They are not ideological liberal commie cooties or mandatory indoctrination. They are not a federal takeover of education. They do not kill Mark Twain. They do not require funky math.They’re just better versions of what we already had.Thanks for the A2A,Mostly Standard Addendum and Disclaimer:I welcome rational, reasoned debate on the merits with reliable, credible sources.But coming on here and calling me names, pissing and moaning about how biased I am, et cetera and so forth,Essentially, act like an adult and don’t be a dick about it.I’m done with warnings.

My former job as an Academic coach I spent a lot of time reviewing curriculum, comparing it to the standards and the resources that help explain the standards (item specifications, frameworks, blueprints, sample questions, illustrated tasks) and making sure the curriculum matches the standards, and covers the curriculum effectively.Here is what I learned. Most curriculum use organizers or methods not required by the standards. Especially in math. The standards have 8 mathematical practices. My favorite two are: Use appropriate tools strategically and attend to precision. If a student doesn’t understand a method, it isn’t an appropriate for them. This odes not mean we don’t teach said method to student, but saying they are wrong if they get the answer a different way is against the standards.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.3K,9.8K,291.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-Virtual-University-degree-in-Pakistan

The waffle recipe I got from my grandfather doesn’t much resemble the one in the BH&G cookbook, but almost everybody agrees that it makes a darned good waffle.Similarly, there are multiple ways to teach a given topic to a particular level of mastery, some of which are effective and some of which aren’t. So every time I see an example of “Common Core Math” on Facebook, I wince. Not because the math in question is necessarily bad—some of it is actually quite well presented, if not in a form that the complainer is used to—but because the math in question isn’t truly “Common Core” at all, any more than a BH&G cookbook is a Denny’s (or Cracker Barrel) menu.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.1K,9.8K,291.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-Virtual-University-degree-in-Pakistan

You went to school - in most cases - over a decade ago, and that ancient, muddled, biased and out-of-date memory of services-received puts you in a position to claim that you understand what goes on at a school?She’s not laughing with you, lad….Here’s a quick quiz and no cheating with Google; unless you’re an educator, how well do you know these terms? Could you use them reasonably and eloquently in an argument?Any modern educator worth their salt is going to get almost or all of those correct.I didn’t even go near technological (cell phone/tablet/laptop), cultural (dress code/hair style/clothing colors), political (teachers who push agendas), literature concerns (approval/rejection/adoption) or a dozen other parts of the schoolhouse.And you think you know what goes on here?I have the highest respect for the parents of my students. I mean that genuinely - I teach some great kids. I don’t know how they do what they do, and I don’t claim to. The same thing should be true in reverse.Contrary to what you may believe when you teach your son or daughter to fish, being an adult with no connection to the child, getting a student to retain an abstract concept that they have no practical value for at the moment, manipulate that concept, and then build on it in years to come is actuallySo please. Let’s be real here. Common Core was a pedagogical shift - which may or may not be entirely valid or defensible, really not the point - that politicians and educators adopted. The American public was nowhere near vested enough in education to know what was really going on before, and that certainly hasn’t changed after.","3,379 followers",Geraldine Cheung,3.3K,531,8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-craziest-story-you-heard-in-IIT-Madras
