Whoever holds the bull nose of technological innovation and who takes the first step of technological innovation Can take the lead and gain advantages.” Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made a series of important expositions on scientific and technological innovation, guiding and motivating scientific researchers to devote themselves to scientific research and tackling key problems. Strong innovation momentum.Facing the complex and ever-changing external environment, many people have doubts: What is China's technological competitiveness? Will changes in the external environment hinder my country's pace of innovation? What is the prospect of China's technology development? The reporter conducted in-depth interviews around these issues.Look at the status quoAfter years of accumulation, my country has become an influential technological power""Scientific and technological strength is mainly reflected in basic scientific research capabilities and high-tech R&D levels. In recent years, China has made tremendous progress in both aspects."" Wang Xiaodong, director of the Beijing Institute of Biological Sciences, is deeply touched by the technological changes in the motherland. ""We Researchers of the Institute are often invited to give academic reports at international conferences, and they have founded 5 companies to develop new drugs based on their original discoveries. This was unimaginable before.""Xiaoxiao Beisheng Institute reflects the overall rise of my country's scientific and technological strength.Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, my country’s scientific and technological undertakings have intensively exerted their efforts and accelerated leapfrogging, and have achieved major historical, holistic, and structural changes. Major innovations have emerged eagerly. Some cutting-edge directions have begun to enter the parallel and leading stage. An important period from quantitative accumulation to qualitative leap and point breakthrough to system capability improvement. Zhao Zhiyun, secretary of the Party Committee of the China Institute of Science and Technology Information, believes that my country has become an influential technological power.——Scientific research conditions are not what they used to be.Research and experimental development (R&D) expenditures increased from 89.6 billion yuan in 2000 to 19,957 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2013 it has become the world's second largest R&D investment country after the United States;""Artificial sun"", ""Chinese Sky Eye"", spallation neutron source, high-energy synchrotron radiation light source and other internationally leading large-scale scientific installations have been put into use one after another, and more and more powerful tools for exploring the mysteries of nature...""I think the current domestic scientific research conditions are different from the past. It is an inevitable trend to make more world-leading results in China."" After graduating from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience researcher Liu Zhen, he was able to apply for jobs in top foreign laboratories. But he finally chose to stay.——Major achievements continue to emerge.On the newly released global supercomputer top 500 list, China continued to rank first with 219 units on the list, and ""Shenwei·Light of Taihu Lake"" and ""Tianhe No. 2"" continued to top the list;In January 2018, the Chinese Academy of Sciences team announced that they had cultivated somatic cloned monkey babies ""Zhongzhong"" and ""Huahua"" for the first time in the world; in January 2019, they successfully constructed a batch of genetically identical baby monkeys for the first time in the world. Biological rhythm disorder macaque model, batch, standardized creation of a new era of disease cloning monkey model has thus opened, which has important value for disease research and drug development.——Technological innovation promotes high-quality development.In 2018, the number of national high-tech enterprises reached 181,000, and the number of small and medium-sized technology enterprises exceeded 130,000.

High-tech companies such as Huawei are included in the ""Entity List"" of the ""Export Control Regulations"" by the United States and have been unreasonably suppressed. In addition, some normal technological cooperation and cultural exchanges are restricted.It is undeniable that developed countries are at the top of the global high-tech chain. Individual countries exert extreme pressure on the industrial chain, supply chain, and innovation chain, which will adversely affect some leading companies and institutions. But in the long run, these effects are temporary and cannot contain the good momentum of my country's technological development.-China has a relatively complete scientific and technological innovation system wit strong breakthrough ability.In April 2015, my country's 4 national supercomputer centers were prohibited from purchasing foreign high-end chips. However, a year later, my country's supercomputer ""Shenwei·Light of Taihu"", which was developed based on a completely independent processor, was on top of the world's supercomputing. At the International Supercomputing Conference held a few days ago, Supercomputing expert Stromeier said: ""With the rapid development of China's supercomputing, it is only a matter of time before China builds a broader supercomputing ecosystem.""""my country's economic system and innovation system have sufficient resilience. Through the efforts of innovation entities and open cooperation, they can withstand the test."" said Wan Jinbo, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Science and Technology Strategy Consulting Institute.——The huge market capacity and huge technical demand provide a broad space for technological development.Not long ago, a research report released by CB Insights, an internationally renowned research organization, showed that among the 32 artificial intelligence unicorn companies in the world, China accounted for 10. Driven by the smart education market, my country is in the forefront of the world in the field of voice recognition technology; the reality of smart security requirements has allowed my country to lead the industry in face recognition technology, and leading companies such as SenseTime, Yuncong, and Yitu have been born. .The huge market potential has supported the application and experimentation of many technologies. Today, innovation in my country's 5G, industrial Internet, artificial intelligence chips and other fields is in full swing. ""From a global perspective, my country's demand for innovation is unparalleled, which will be an important driving force for my country's technological development."" Pan Jiaofeng said.——The institutional advantage of concentrating resources on major tasks to ensure that scientific and technological research focuses on major national strategic needs.In May 2017, the domestically produced large aircraft C919 completed its maiden flight, and my country became one of the few countries in the world capable of producing large aircraft; in December 2018, the Beidou-3 basic system was declared completed, and my country is the third country in the world to have autonomous satellite navigation System country. In recent years, my country's major breakthroughs in aviation, new energy vehicles, tunneling equipment and other fields are closely related to the efficient decision-making system that concentrates forces and allocates resources rationally.""my country's comprehensive public R&D system can guarantee the systematic advancement of strategic planning and the effective implementation of major projects. Practice has proved that this is the organizational advantage of my country's scientific and technological innovation."" Wan Jinbo believes.-The ""stuck neck"" issue strengthens my country's determination to innovate independently.A few days ago, my country announced the first batch of space science experiments around the China Space Station. 23 entities from 17 countries actively participated; the ecology of Intel architecture has gathered millions of developers from all over the world, including China.“Throughout the history of modern science and technology development, everyone’s achievements in scientific research are done on the basis of others, and the high-tech industry also develops rapidly in competition and cooperation. The artificial hindrance of scientific and technological exchanges violates the laws of technological development and also It doesn't conform to the trend of history, it can't be long."" Wang Xiaodong said.""Before the ZTE and Huawei incidents, many people thought that chips could be bought directly from the market, just like ordinary electronic components. With this lesson, more and more Chinese people are now spontaneously concerned about domestic chip technology and industry."" Ni Guangnan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that technological control will only further stimulate the country's motivation for independent innovation and force the upsurge of independent innovation.The interviewed experts believe that in the short term, the ""stuck neck"" problem will cause certain obstacles to my country's current technological development, but in the long term it may also be a major opportunity to enhance independent innovation capabilities. Open cooperation is still the general trend.seek the futureContinue to deepen the reform of the science and technology system, fully tap the innovation potential, and stimulate innovation vitalityIn the face of external risks and challenges, doing one's own affairs well and developing our country's science and technology better and faster is the most powerful response.——Continue to deepen the reform of the scientific and technological system and fully tap the potential for innovation.In April of this year, Tsinghua University issued ""Several Opinions on Improving the Academic Evaluation System"", focusing on reversing the tendency of academic evaluations to be papers, hats, titles, academic qualifications, and awards, and stimulate innovation. As soon as this ""breaking the five wei"" reform document was released, it caused heated discussions in academic circles.""Our country's technological competitiveness must leap from first-class to super-class, and it must be driven by reform,"" said Wen Jirong, dean of the School of Information, Renmin University of China.The interviewed experts pointed out that to build a world power in science and technology, it is necessary to further deepen reforms to establish a more efficient fund use mechanism, a more scientific technology evaluation system, a more reasonable salary system, and a more complete intellectual property protection system to further encourage innovation. , An environment of tolerance and innovation fully stimulates the huge potential of science and technology as the primary productive force.——Continue to strengthen basic research and lay a solid foundation for technological innovation.Tsinghua University professor Xue Qikun’s team observed the ""quantum anomalous Hall effect"" for the first time in the world. This achievement won the first prize of the 2018 National Natural Science Award. The first prize of the National Natural Science Award, which was vacant for 9 times, has now been ""undefeated"" for 6 consecutive years, marking a significant improvement in the overall level of basic research in my country.""Basic research must have a spirit of foolish old man moving mountains, insisting on doing one thing well for one, two, or even several generations."" Xue Qikun said.The source of Jun is long, and the root is Ye Mao. As the source of the entire scientific system, the importance of basic research is self-evident. With a deep reserve of basic research, it is possible to grasp the leading power of technological development, the right to formulate technical standards, and obtain the first-mover advantage of innovation. Strengthening basic research requires not only increased investment in national finance and social capital, but also scientific research personnel with lofty aspirations, the pursuit of excellence, and the spirit of ""sit on the bench for ten years"" to concentrate on research.-Make great efforts to continuously tackle key problems and realize independent control of key core technologies.Not long ago, the 2019 undergraduates of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences were pleasantly surprised when they received the admission notice: This ""hardest core"" notice is embedded with a ""Loongson III"" chip! Although the chip is small, it is the soul of the information industry, and it is the result of 18 years of hard work and innovation by the Godson team. General-purpose chips, commercial aircraft, third-generation nuclear power, high-speed trains...In recent years, as the key core technology of the “national weight”, the supporting role of high-quality economic and social development has become increasingly prominent.Time is changing, the opportunity is still in me. Only by effectively improving key core technological innovation capabilities can we firmly grasp the initiative in technological development in our own hands. ""The key core technology is not unattainable. We have enough confidence."" According to Hu Zhijian, the director of the China Academy of Science and Technology Development Strategy, today's China is more equipped to break through key core technologies in terms of scientific and technological strength and economic foundation. Emboldened. ""As long as we continue to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and unswervingly follow the road of independent innovation, we will surely be able to achieve independent and controllable key core technologies.""-firmly establish the strategic position of talents leading development and stimulate the innovative vitality of scientific and technological talents.At the front line of Huawei’s innovation, there are more than 700 mathematicians, more than 800 physicists, more than 120 chemists, and more than 6,000 experts from other fields; Huawei’s R&D personnel still maintain a proportion of nearly 50%. …It is with a strong talent pool that Huawei has the confidence to deal with wind and rain without fear of wind and rain.",7 followers,Michelle Zhou,3.6K,246,17.7M,https://www.quora.com/Does-China-have-the-ability-to-produce-original-products
