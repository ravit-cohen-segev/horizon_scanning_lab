They’re a $400 million dollar watch company.I thought this meeting would give me all the answers.It took me six months to land this meeting.When we met, I felt like a idiot.Looking back on it, I was asking him the most basic questions about ecommerce.I really had no clue what I was doing.He probably left thinking my company would remain an idea.(We met before I had my first sample).Flash forward a year and my company was doing just over six figures in sales.I then heard of a talk Andy was giving.I went to the talk and stayed after, eager to catch up with him.As I approached, he said, man you look familiar!He was stoked that I had actually turned my idea into my own business.Andy gets requests to meet with hundreds of entrepreneurs a year. Most don’t go forward with the next steps of starting a company.Most first time entrepreneurs get caught up and don’t actually grow.They expect a mentor or coach to do the work for them.First time entrepreneurs need to know that there isn’t a magic box or person with all the answers.Your path to success will be different than someone else’s.Finding your own way is part of the journey.Though having a great mentor can help, you can’t expect them to do the work for you.The watch strap I invented!",1 follower,Nathan Resnick,32.7K,219,4.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-must-reads-according-to-David-S-Rose-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs
1,"I’m going to be very direct. I’ve started many companies. I’ve invested in many more. Some have failed. Some have succeeded beyond anything I could have hoped for. I have learned from the best. I have been scared to death by the worst.You don’t have to listen to me. These are books I would read again and again and again if I were going to start a business.First piece of advice, don’t read the typical entrepreneur porn book.

Deeply personal things happen thaI’m going to be very direct. I’ve started many companies. I’ve invested in many more. Some have failed. Some have succeeded beyond anything I could have hoped for. I have learned from the best. I have been scared to death by the worst.You don’t have to listen to me. These are books I would read again and again and again if I were going to start a business.First piece of advice, don’t read the typical entrepreneur porn book. Books about entrepreneurship are all BS. Entrepreneurship is about fighting a war in the trenches. Bad things happen. Scary things happen. Deeply personal things happen that you’ll never admit ever again to anyone because of the shame you feel.Ok, I got that out of the way.The question says “entrepreneur” but I don’t even like that word. Everyone is an entrepreneur now. If you are an employee, it still means you have to manage your life the way an entrepreneur manages a business. You have to deal with customers, bosses, shareholders, and all the things that screw with life that happen every step of the way.So these are books a person should read as they try to achieve peak performance in life. As they try to find freedom, as they try to succeed in the relationships around them, as they try to build competence in the areas they love - and even find what those areas are.Here is a curriculum I would build for such a person. Note: these are not the BEST books, or the most mind-expanding books. But these are books for someone who wants to improve their lot in life.A) MASTERY. Read all of Robert Greene’s books.Particularly, “Robert Greene does years of research on each book. He studies the psychological nuances of almost every act of victory and failure in the history of the human race. He pieces together not just the event but the underlying psychology.As an aside, if you are truly fascinated with the study of peak performance, read “Peak” by Anders Ericsson, who is the original scientist behind the phrase, “The 10,000 hour rule”.Read these books and think about them. I’ve read them all three or four times.B) DO.There's a little known series I am finding short and beautiful and useful. A friend of mine designed all the covers so I started reading them. The “Do” series.To be honest, they are a recent discovery by me. But here’s why I love them: entrepreneurship is about solving a problem.What annoys you? What betrays you? What is unsatisfying in life? For instance, waiting for a cab on a rainy day when I have no umbrella annoys me. Thank god now for Uber.The same issue occurs for an artist. The problem is: I see something beautiful, and I want to bring it to life with my hands. Just like an entrepreneur.The Do books are about birthing beauty into the world. Either through art, story, performance, speaking, etc.Entrepreneurship, at its heart, is art. The DO books tell you how to create.C) ME. I don’t mean to self-promote. And to be honest, I make a total of $0 off of these books.But I wrote three books to help me solve my own problems in entrepreneurship. The problems that nobody sees. The actual things that I couldn’t deal with and had to learn the hard way.“Choose Yourself”It was really hard for me to feel deserving of success when I left the normal “standardized world”. And then I failed horribly whenever success flirted with me.I was ashamed and embarrassed until I realized I can, in fact, choose myself for success. In these books I document in detail how I did it - from suicide and depression to success and freedom.Don’t buy the books if you don’t want to. But after 600,000 copies sold of Choose Yourself I know they are helpful to people.You can only be a sell-out if you are selling.D) CURIOSITY. Brian Grazer is a mega movie prodycer. Apollo 13, a beautiful mind, splash, arrested development, etc etc. 15 billion in box office revs.He wrote a good, simple book that can be read in just a few readings -If a young man wants to rise up in life to the top he should cultivate the curious mind the young, but seriously dyslexic, Brian grazer cultivated.I was so interested in the book, I flew out to LA to visit Brian in his offices and talk about the book more. He was playful, curious, full of advice, and he listened. He was unlike anyone I had ever met, which is why he’s probably one of the most successful people I’ve ever met.E) EGO. Pair the above withALL FAILURE I have ever experiences is when my ego got in the way of my rational self. At heart we are just trying to survive. We’ve been given a sliver of light between two infinite and dark infinities.There’s no reason for ego. As Ryan puts it, “Alexander the Great” doesn’t care if Alexandria is named after him.Use the fact that everyone else has ego to your advantage. Become the nimble and creative person who challenges everyone and rises to the top before people see it coming.F) KNOWLEDGE. Don’t forget about getting basic knowledge.Entrepreneurs don’t need to know about how to read a profit and loss statement. I still don’t know anything about accounting.But know history. Know the history of knowledge. Know the history of great people.Here are some parting thoughts on books that I think are must-reads.“Modern Times”“The Rational Optimist”“Sapiens”“Socrates”“Grit”“Tiny Beautiful Things”By the way, this is only the beginning. The successful person makes reading a daily habit. I am not always good with this habit but I try. Today I finished “No Country for Old Men” by Cormac McCarthy and I started “The Fight” by Normal Mailer, a beautiful book about the Ali-Foreman fight in 1974.On my list is “Magic and Loss” by Virginia Heffernan about the relationship between the Internet and Art. And also on my list is “The Sun and the Moon and The Rolling Stones” by Rich Cohen.Every book try to get one takeaway. You can’t absorb all of a book. It’s too hard. One takeaway form each book, a solid reading habit, and good books, and you will be ahead of 99.999% of the human race.But it’s not a race. There’s no finish line. There’s only joy and well-being and the pleasure of absorbing the lives and gifts of these great authors. I hope you like this list.","284,818 followers",James Altucher,1K,878,91.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-must-reads-according-to-David-S-Rose-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs

Good luck with that, I hope you are.You see, I didn’t have a choice. My father wasn’t a doctor or a lawyer or an accountant, he was a small business owner. He was married and divorced twice, he had his first heart attack at 50. He drank too much, and he died at 64 years old. If that is the life you want, then become an entrepreneur. 9 out of 10 of you will end up just like that. What? What about me? Yep, well I seem to be one of the lucky 4%, but it cost me my first marriage, everything I owned at least once and many sleepless nights working 20 hours a day. Was it worth it?

5,"The first books I recommend to be successful are the books related to personal finance and investing because those books are the ones that most people never read and yet personal finance is one of the most important topics in the world. Ii's unfortunate that our education systems never teach this and yet managing our money is one of the most important topics for the rest of our lives.If we don't manage our money and know how to invest it properly without losing it, then we end up broke and in debt. Therefore, I recommend these beginner fundamental books in personal finance and money managementThe first books I recommend to be successful are the books related to personal finance and investing because those books are the ones that most people never read and yet personal finance is one of the most important topics in the world. Ii's unfortunate that our education systems never teach this and yet managing our money is one of the most important topics for the rest of our lives.If we don't manage our money and know how to invest it properly without losing it, then we end up broke and in debt. Therefore, I recommend these beginner fundamental books in personal finance and money management:The first book I recommend is called Rich Dad Poor Dad because it has incredibly detailed money mindsets and probably the best ones I have ever encountered.The second book I recommend is called The Millionaire Next Door, which does a scientific analysis on some of the richest people in the entire country and they found some very startling and surprising things about millionaires for example they found that most millionaires live very modest lives and it's that 1% of flashy millionaires that make them look bad.Most millionaires spend wisely they don't spend excessively and the most common car that they own is a pickup truck not a Ferrari.The final beginner book on money I recommend is called Money: Master the game by Tony Robbins.After you finish these Beginner Books, here some specific books that have actual massive impact and can really walk you through managing and investing your money and growing it.To get started, the first is called I will teach you to be rich by Ramit Sethi and the second is called The Millionaire teacher by Andrew Howard.The final Big Bang book that I recommend if you want to be successful with your money is called Laws of Success by Napoleon Hill. Hill spent his whole life studying 500 of the richest people in the world.He rubbed shoulders with billionaires such as Carnegie, Ford, and Edison. I trust his advice on wealth more than anyone else in the world. Now why did I choose this book?Hill wrote many many books but this one was really his A to Z magnum opus. This is the book where he covered every single detail of success and I really think it's the first book that you should read of his because it's the one that really covers everything in detail.Now, money is important but there's a lot more to success than just money so I recommend some other books on life success that are just as crucial. The first is called The Top 5 regrets of the dying.This book was written by a nurse who saw over 200 elderly people pass in a retirement shelter. She observed many people admit their life regrets. This is probably one of the biggest things that you can avoid in life by simply knowing about them early on. One of these regrets was I wish I live a life true to myself rather than a life that other people wanting me to live.Our parents or family or friends have their own goals for how they want us to live our lives. Some of them want us to have certain jobs we don't want all those want us to do things that we don't want. This book really helped cement and change my life decisions. I read this book often and come back to it to realign myself. Finally there are a lot of books on light hacking that I think are really important towards really optimizing your life. Warren Buffett said that we are all creatures of habit and the earlier on that you can form good habits the more they will compound throughout your life. Since our whole days are filled with habits it would make sense to get early habits into your life that are beneficial.The more we delay the higher chance that these habits or harder to fix. Therefore I recommend the book The Power of Habit by Charles duhigg. add eyes into a ton of scientific analysis on why habits formed and how to improve bad habits forming good habits. next there are a lot of books on certain levels of success that go on red by the general public. I recommend the book mindset the psychology of success by Carol dweck. this book goes into scientific analysis and psychological studies of why certain people succeed While others don't simply by how they view growth or the inevitability of life.It's called the growth mindset and it really shapes why certain people are successful While others are not. on a similar vein another lever for Success that is usually gone unnoticed is something called emotional intelligence. I recommend the books emotional intelligence and emotional intelligence to .4 for that reason. now I don't want to overwhelm you and there's so many other books out there that I want to share with you but these are the fundamentals to get you started. don't let this overwhelm you just pick one or two that will really have a massive impact on your life and start there. for me it may seem to you like I have read so many books but in reality I don't read that much on a daily basis I'm Couple chapters a day or pop open an audiobook for 20 minutes. But over years that adds up and since the average person doesn't read at all you really get ahead over time. The final book I want to recommend is A book on happiness.Most people chase happiness but they have flawed beliefs throughout their whole life on how to achieve it. In fact if you think about it most people do most things in life in the pursuit of happiness whether it's chasing money or chasing thing. I was quite lost when it came to happiness and struggled with it for quite a while. I turn to a lot of people gave a lot of opinions and their own ideas on what happiness meant and how to achieve it. I finally turn to science. I watched every Ted Talk in video on the science of Happiness on line. Then I read many books that were supposedly on the signs of happiness but turned out to be really crappy. Finally I found the gold add book on happiness.This book is called the how of happiness. It truly is the A to Z book on what makes us happy and it goes into it extensive scientific analysis with tons of studies to back it up on what makes us happy and what doesn't and how to improve our happiness for the long term. This book really shocked me because what most of us assume makes us happy is not what actually makes us happy. For example many people think that money will make us happy but a lot of scientific analysis shows that we get used to that extra money very quickly and our happiness drops back to normal levels very quickly.I am not saying that money has no effect on happiness I'm just simply saying that the effects diminish very quickly as you make just even more just a little bit more money. instead there's all sorts of other techniques that you can use that really will help improve your long-term happiness such as giving back having gratitude and appreciating the small things in life and save her and then. Hopefully this helped and I would be more than willing to give you even more books I have a ton so come back to me once you have finished thoseP.S. don't let this overwhelm you. As I said just do what you can read a couple Ppages a day and within a few years you will have read them all. But of course, if you want to go overboard go ahead and read as much as you can be my guest will","163,175 followers",Gaurav Munjal,695,371,13.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-must-reads-according-to-David-S-Rose-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs

Read biographies of great people or novels - most are more valuable for life than most of the entrepreneurship books combined. When you are in the fundraising stage, pick a book on fundraising. When you need to get first client, go to amazon and find top rated sales book. But don't read books about fundraising and growth hacking just because ""every entrepreneur should read this"". Every entrepreneur should work on the product and sell to customers in the first place.Don't waste time education yourself on how to be a great CEO if you live in a garage. Read it when you are a CEO. Until then it's fantasy and fantasy ≠ reality.Also you will forget 95% of the stuff your read if you can't immediately apply it.","163,175 followers",Gaurav Munjal,635,371,13.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-must-reads-according-to-David-S-Rose-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs

Successful people are not always highly intelligent. Therefore it follows that the traits of successful people are not what you should automatically expect in highly intelligent people. They wont automatically be organized, they wont always have great habits. They wont always dominate in social or business circles. They wont automatically rise to the top of a social hierarchy and they wont always be liked or even admired by their peers. They are not automatically emotionally centered and under control. They are not just awkward technical robots with no personality either. The stereotypes surrounding highly intelligent people are often misleading since they suggest that they need to have a pair of spectacles, read incessantly and feel awkward around members of the opposite sex. None of these is definitive. Spotting highly intelligent people can sometimes be as difficult as spotting somebody who enjoys blue cheese. They need to be in the right context to display what gives them away.

13,"There is a fine line between intelligence (IQ) and smart (EQ) people.Intelligent people are drawn to very complex problem and they are obsessed of finding the next challenges. They are highly interest focus, like to engage in deep or technical conversations.

Sorry Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, you make a lot of really good points, but you are garbage that borders on sophistry.If you are looking to spot people with really high IQ scores, you have a flawed way of searching for intelligent people. IQ is the intelligence version of the Rorschach personality test for personality traits. It’s not an accurate measure, it is a baseline. I have often been called the “dumbest smart person” that they know. Want to know the dirty little secret of most people with high IQ scores? They are like me, underachievers with issues that fail in life more often than the idiot who is driven to follow his ambition. I’m not saying to NOT be intellectual, I’m just saying… don’t idolize the IQ score. I respect a LOT of people, intellectually speaking, who are generally not as smart as me, who are brilliant… genius even, in ways I am not. Intellectually speaking, I NEED these people. Socially speaking, I NEED these people.So… if you only want to quickly identify the high IQ scoring people, that is easy. Look for the idiots who have nothing to brag about except how high they score. I probably have a higher score. They will be the know-it-all’s and the loud minority of bright people.If you want to identify the really intelligent people in your life, play fun mental games with them. Ask them riddles and give them no-pressure time to think. When they are wrong, ask them if they want to guess again or know the answer. When unsure of something, ask for their help and see how they go about solving your shared problem. If it is presumption and other stupidity… moron. If it is analytical, you struck gold.

Let me explain with an analogy in physics. You video record an accelerating car wheel. When the wheel is starting to spin, everything looks normal, the camera sampling frequency is able to capture accurately it's actual spinning frequency. The wheel spins faster and faster. At a certain speed the camera will suddenly appear to stop spinning faster, it actually appears to spin slower. This effect happens because at a certain point the wheel spins faster than the processing (sampling) speed of the camera. This effect is also known as the aliasing effect.A highly intelligent person will give you answers that sound dumb, because your sampling rate can't capture his/her higher intelligence.Next time when you talk to someone who sounds pretty stupid, you might just be talking to someone pretty intelligent 😉",3 followers,José Alberto,2.7K,69,2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-must-reads-according-to-David-S-Rose-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs

Sure, you could do puzzle solving tests, but puzzle performance can be affected by personality issues. I knew this poor girl in college who totally froze up on a test, but she was reasonably intelligent by my assessment.I agree in part and disagree in part with some of the other answers here on how intelligent people speak. I had two uncles who were epic geniuses. One of them did fluid dynamics work for top secret government projects. He could do simultaneous equations in his head, in 100 unknowns. He never thought it was a big deal. He often said anybody could learn to do it, there was a trick to it. Riiight. Whatever. Nobody in our family could do it but him. He just didn’t seem to realize how far out in front of the rest of us he was.But at the same time, you meet him on the street, you couldn’t tell him from any ordinary guy. He was always clear, but he was just effortless at slipping into this higher gear dealing with some of the hardest concepts of science. It was all just easy for him. But he never made you feel he was any smarter than anyone else. You just felt you were dealing with a regular guy who also happened to be able to do some cool math tricks, AND everybody wanted to hire him. But he was just uncle to us.But chess? Forget it. No chance of beating him. Ever. Unless he let you. ;)As for some of the other ‘genius stereotypes’ I’m reading here, my dad was a professional educator for over 40 years and ran a number of gifted programs. The stereotype of the rumpled shirt, scruffy looking genius with lousy social skills was NOT accurate in my dad’s gifted student population. My dad concluded exactly the opposite, that giftedness was broadly based, i.e., a gifted individual was likely to be proficient in many things, including not only abstract reasoning or puzzle solving, but also social behavior, personal hygiene, good communication skills, various other success factors. In other words, exceptionally intelligent people can also be really good at blending in and NOT being detected when it’s more to their advantage to be thought of as just a regular person.One caveat to that. Dad did tell me of one longitudinal study he saw where they found the students who went on to be the most ‘successful’ later in life were neither the top students nor the middle range, but the ‘above average’ group, not too high, not too low. Apparently, the theory goes, this ‘above average’ group had the raw intelligence to be very good at reasoning tasks, but they also had the wisdom to live well, spend time at the pub joking around with friends, or being with their family, or whatever made their life more complete and satisfying.

They get by doing what they've always done, and they're contented with that.When a person comes up against something they don't understand: a low IQ person will just shrug and move on, or they'll ask someone else to fix the problem for them; a high IQ person will google it, ask questions, read more, try it for themselves, experiment, and is determined to understand.Curiosity is multifaceted. It's drive, motivation, interest, knowledge of your own abilities, etc. If you know you are rubbish at something, and you know you can live happily without it, then you don't need to bother even trying to improve. If you know you're good at it, you'll never be bored with more of it.High IQ people are curious about lots and lots of things. Even if it's just academic, the knowledge and understanding in itself is a reward. Even if you're not going to apply it, the titbits of trivia areThere's also the aspects of learning faster, picking up on concepts easier, etc, but in a field you are interested in, even an average person can learn faster than a higher IQ person who is not interested. To me, this is similar thinking across the board - I want to do this thing, therefore I want to know how to do it, therefore I'll push myself till I get it right. The need to apply a skill comes first, therefore they learn.With curious people, the learning is first, then that opens possibilities to applying it.Now that I know quite a few lower IQ people, I have found the real difference is curiosity. I'm actually amazed howWith high IQ people, there's an awareness of possibilities out there. They realise there's a whole lot they don't know. And when they find out about a new thing, they want to know all about it.

The more homogeneous a herd is, the less internal conflict. And conversely: any herd will always expunge and ostracize a different individual, and attack it if it differs too much from the norm of the herd.People with high IQ have different preferences, different priorities, different tastes and different interests than normies. This makes them different. What normies consider “awkward social skills” are simplyTo put it bluntly:If we set the average IQ of a human society as 100, we see that the vast majority of people (67% to be exact) fall within -1 and +1 standard deviations (84 to 116). Those form the bulk of humanity, and they have no problems on relating to each other. They live in the same world. The society plays by their rules. It is their social skillset which matters.When one’s IQ begins to deviate into either direction - upper or lower - differences and also discrepancies begin to appear. Those with deviation to lower side have it worse; their deviation from the normies’ ruleset is consideredBut once one’s IQ begins to deviate to the right side of the Gaussian curve, problems will emerge. The concept of theThe French have a saying:Those with IQ between one and two standard deviations above the average have an asset: theirs is higher than that of the normies, but not too much. They still fit in the norm of the herd. But the more one’s IQ deviates from the norm, the more his game differs from that of the normies.At the Mensa intake limit (2 standard deviations) the situation is not yet bad: approximately half of the society fall in their communication range. But the situation begins to exacerbate quickly; at the Triple Nine intake limit (three standard deviations), only 16% of the people in the society befall there.When one’s IQ increases, the following trends can be observed:These are not signs of bad social skills; they are signs of a different ruleset altogether.

But how often is it that we ever need to discard 99 of the population then carefully inspect the remaining 1 percent? Special forces are called that because they are special. In their cases both physical and mental so this is an indirect example.You asked about quick not accurate, though. Because of the Mount Ignorance feature of the Dunning Kroger Effect, we can’t go with self opinion. Self opinion is completely out. So I’ll suggest two fast methods.One. The more value someone puts on IQ, the lower theirs is going to end up. It’s just a test score, even though the tests are designed to measure general intelligence. It’s also something handed to us by our parents so it’s never possible to validly consider a high score to be a personal achievement.People with high scores understand they didn’t earn it so they put low value on it. People with low scores can end up figuring they earned it so they put high value on it.Two. Hire folks with well documented high scores and ask them. We can’t ever estimate our own score because of the Dunning Kroger Effect, but we can and do know how to compare others against ourselves. So take the word of people with well documented high scores.This works because of the communications range. We can have meaningful communication with people in the plus or minus 30 point range. It’s easy to dumb down your speech to have low meaning communications with people more than 30 under, but that means those 30 or more under can only tell you are at least 30 over not how much over.Is it worth hiring people in the 135 up range to identify folks higher? If you’re on the admissions committee at an elite college, sure. There aren’t that many situations where it matters. For nearly all events in every day life, 135 and up is smart enough and that’s good enough.","33,014 followers",Susanna Viljanen,1.6K,10.7K,164.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-quickly-detect-high-IQ-people

Their influence has instilled a sense of confidence, enlightenment, empowerment. Of course the opposite can also be true. Perhaps they left you perplexed after dropping a profound nugget of irrefutable wisdom in your lap that you are chastising yourself for somehow overlooking?Intelligent people incite thought in hopes of provoking action. If you go to them with an issue or concern, they will put on their telltale constipated face and slightly tilted jaw mask with glazed over eyes and wait patiently to ask really simple questions with profound implications.Guess what. The highly intelligent person already has a rough draft of all of the answers that you can possibly give floating in their mind. They are testing your beliefs and convictions. Gathering focused information to work with. Establishing credibility, sincerity. Behind the facial expression (or lack thereof), a self-debate rages over the implications of the investment in time on a scale of value. Is it worth the effort here?Manipulation is not always a negative thing, especially when the end result is gained wisdom, knowledge, confidence, or security.Highly intelligent people have an awe inspiring aura about them. Something about their presence and demeanor will leave a mental impression long after you have gone your seperate ways. They have a tendency to elicit a reaction. After a lengthy conversation with a high IQ person, the aftermath will be to ponder all the questions that have blossomed, that hadn't yet materialized at the time. Intelligent people plant mental seeds in others as a hobby to distract themselves from the chaos in their own minds.In the end, the coin is yours to flip. Are they crazy smart? Or just plain crazy? Time will tell.For what it's worth, professional testing pegs me in the 137-144 IQ range. A dozen points higher for the psuedo credible online evaluations. It's one small sliver of the giant pie of life that conspires to create our unique identity. In the end, it's your life to live. Your future will become the culmination of consequences for your own decisions. And, sometimes, incredibly smart people give incredibly poor advice and make some really disastrous decisions.It's been said that ignorance is bliss. That would make intelligence a curse. I will compromise and call it a blessing in disguise. Life goes on..--------Edit.. thanks for the responses. Had no idea this posted opinion would provoke such reactions. I appreciate the perspectives shared. Yes, even the pesky naysayers.

33,"First, I want to say a couple of things about IQ testing. IQ tests are the best instrument we have for measuring intellect, capacity to learn, and potential for academic achievement. However, it is not perfect AT ALL.IQ results *correlate* with intelligence but I have met many people with IQs under 130 or 125 who, objectively, seem very intelligent. These tests bias against certain under-represented groups. And, I’ve met many people with IQs over 130 who waste their lives, turn toward criminal pursuits, and generally are not successful in life.But, this answer is not about IQ test validity andFirst, I want to say a couple of things about IQ testing. IQ tests are the best instrument we have for measuring intellect, capacity to learn, and potential for academic achievement. However, it is not perfect AT ALL.IQ results *correlate* with intelligence but I have met many people with IQs under 130 or 125 who, objectively, seem very intelligent. These tests bias against certain under-represented groups. And, I’ve met many people with IQs over 130 who waste their lives, turn toward criminal pursuits, and generally are not successful in life.But, this answer is not about IQ test validity and bias. So, I will spend the rest of this answer focusing on what I have observed over the past 30 years, interacting with highly gifted people.As a former educator, teaching gifted children and having spent lots of time at a special school for the gifted, I have seen a wide range of intellectual capability from those with IQs in the 130–165 range. In addition, I have worked in the biotech and hitech industries for 30 years and have worked directly with very intellectually advanced people. Finally, I have advanced training in clinical psychology and have studied intelligence.Here is what I’ve noticed. There is very little difference between someone with an IQ of 125 and 135. These are people who learn quickly, can be highly creative at times, are good problem solvers, tend to be skilled in multiple areas and are good communicators. These are the folks who end up being productive managers at companies. Many earn advanced degrees or are very successful without an advanced degree.Then there are those who are truly brilliant. They tend to have IQs in the 140–155 range. What I see from such individuals is a very consistent ability to think outside the box and derive new and better ways of doing things. And, this appears to happen without much effort, sometimes quite spontaneously. People in this category can move easily from one industry to another and can catch up with others who have spent many years studying. They are inventors, CEOs, polymaths and entrepreneurs.Then, there is yet a further category — very, very rare. I have met a few people with IQs in the 160+ range who are quite different. They might have the abilities of the 140–155 folks, but also have very heightened wisdom. They may choose not to do certain things that come very easily to them for ethical or societal reasons. These are the folks who have tremendous peace in their lives who you see tinkering by writing a book or playing chess. Geniuses who are teachers, writers, artists or work on the helping professions. They’ve often taken themselves out of the daily rat race that we define as societal productivity.What I am describing above as three distinct levels or qualities of intellect is not rigid. Many highly intelligent people have characteristics of one or more of these groups and may or may not have the IQs I’ve listed. What I am writing about are trends I’ve noticed over the past 40+ years interacting with the highly gifted. There are, of course, many outliers and exceptions to the above.",0 followers,Marielle Valenzuela,616,205,248.4K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-quickly-detect-high-IQ-people
34,"One excellent indicator is a vast and credible knowledge of a very wide range of topics. When this is not something a person tries to exhibit as a show-off, but is simply his natural state of knowledge, you have a bright person.Bright people will also understand rarely used words, but will have the good sense to not inject them into speech when addressing someone whom he knows will not be familiar with the words.Bright people have high mental speed and can respond faster than other people to things that require cognitive processing.",276 followers,Holly McCrea,7.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-quickly-detect-high-IQ-people
