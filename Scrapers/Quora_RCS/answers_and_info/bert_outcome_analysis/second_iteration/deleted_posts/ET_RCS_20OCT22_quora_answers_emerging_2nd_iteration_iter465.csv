In the final battle, Luke Skywalker flies his X-wing fighter at extremely low level through a trench on the powerful Death Star, in order to fire missiles at the space stations core. His super space fighter is equipped with a navigation and targeting computer. The cockpit display looks like this :This system presumably helps Skywalker to fly as low as possible without hitting the surface. It also acts as a bombing computer, basically telling the pilot when to push the fire button to hit its target. This was 1977 Sci-Fi level technology.Now, twelve years earlier, in 1965, very real US naval aviators, flying the very real A-6 Intruder bomber, were flying bombing missions over North Vietnam. The A-6 had what was called DIANE (Digital Integrated Attack/Navigation Equipment). The pilot’s display looked like this :Instead of looking outside (and seeing nothing, since the A-6s flew at night in bad weather), the pilot watched this screen that clearly - for a trained eye - showed relief and distances. It also conveniently provided navigation hints.This picture actually shows what the late 80s A-6E Intruder Vertical Display Indicator looked like. The Vietnam era VDI was more crude, and at one point orange, I think, instead of green. That being said, it was still an impressive piece of technology for its time :> Kaiser Aircraft & Electronics (now Kaiser Electronics) built the first instrumentation system in the late 1950s. The original operational display presented ground and sky texture to the pilot with a well-defined horizon for attitude, “highway in the sky” for steering and numerous other symbols for execution of various attack maneuvers.“Life of the Intruder”, Naval Aviation News, 1997 [ https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1990/1997/september-october/intruder.pdf ]Here is how Brian Bryans, former A-6 pilot and author of Flying Low, describes the VDI as he discovered it in the mid 60s :> An A-6 pilot had the world’s largest attitude indicator centered on the instrument panel right in front of his face. It was similar in size and appearance to the early TV screens and was called a VDI. It had a pale orange glow and showed an artificial horizon across the middle of its screen with puffy white clouds over it. […] When it got real black outside, you turned up the rosy glow on the VDI and it looked like you were over Kansas on a sunny day. […] The computer generated a curved path on the VDI, so all the pilot had to do was to follow the yellow brick road across “Kansas”.The Terrain Clearance Mode (using the data from the Terrain Following Radar) allowed the pilot to fly low and follow the relief to avoid radar detection and Surface to Air Missile. (The A-6 autopilot could not, as I had first written, do terrain following.)The A-6 also did its own bombing. Once over its target, it told the pilot how it ...",88 followers,Guillaume Lavallée,1.6K,114,711.2K,https://www.quora.com/How-likely-is-it-that-the-US-government-has-highly-advanced-technology-that-the-public-does-not-know-about-When-I-say-highly-advanced-I-mean-technology-that-is-almost-at-the-level-of-Sci-Fi

7,"The preamble to GPS started in the 1950s. After a plane was shot down “in Soviet airspace” gps was available to the public in 86. It's accuracy increased in the 90s. The military always has tech 2,3,4 possibly even 5 decades beyond the civilian world. Now whether or not that translates into flying saucers and such depends on how you feel about what they fly from southern Nevada.

Still does I suppose, but it's 40+ year old tech, from an 80 year old design concept.They might have next gen smart bullets. They might be experimental. The difference in operational, and experimental is simply all out war. They might not acknowledge such a thing, for decades, but bet your ass if we were at war with a near-peer state tomorrow, and such a thing was “experimental” it would find it's way to “operational” quite quickly.My point isn't that they have such a thing, I know people have and will research it. I don't know how well it is (would be) going. My point is rather, if you can think of it, and it lives in the world of scientific possibility, someone else has too. The US military has shown countless times that they can, will, and do produce things beyond our grasp. But these things that seem so far fetched, when released are almost normal here in the States, because on some level Americans expect that kind of thing from history. They will absolutely reveal something akin to the f-117/Manhattan project/ precision munitions/etc. but there's also no telling that its going to be some world-eater weapon. I'd say GPS, among other tech, has just as much profound impact on warfare as the bullets, bombs, and planes. They researched heat and sound weapons for less-lethal options. You never hear about that much. How about the Boomerang (sniper finder)? That's pretty impressive as well.When you field an arsenal of one-off tech, simply because you can, you will undoutably be researching all kinds of “sci-fi” stuff. I guarantee if the military needed lasers as weapons now, they'd have a card up their sleeve.

That was just part of the mission. And that is a good thing - it was already massively challenging to send as much stuff to the moon as we did!ToMars is about 150 times farther away from us than the moon is, at its closest. As a very rough approximation, it’s fair to say that going to the moon is 150 times harder and 150 times more expensive. I know all you super space nerds are salivating at this statement, but I saidIn simple terms, we’ll need a lot more food, water, and air. Astronauts will be exposed to lots more radiation, which makes the ship design significantly more complex. Mars is more massive, so leaving is much trickier. And the change in speed required to get there and back is much greater than what was required to go to the moon and back.Now, realize that all of what I just said refers toI think you can see where this is going.StayingSo how do we ever establish colonies?We wait. The technology to affordably stay on Mars (or the moon, for that matter) simply doesn’t exist yet. But technology keeps advancing at a blistering pace. It may not be too long until we can build machines that can make food, water, and oxygen out of rocks. All the elements we need are there - they’re just arranged “incorrectly”. Right now that idea seems almost magical, but think about what Edison might have thought upon seeing a computer…Sadly, you may have been born too early to wait that long. You will (hopefully) live to see humans walk on Mars. You might even get to be one of the lucky few to go yourself.But there were only 12 humans that ever walked on the moon, and chances are they’ll all be dead before a human steps foot on Mars.

14,"The most accurate answer is that there’s just no way to know for certain.When we successfully landed humans on the moon (for the 6th time), human habitation throughout the solar system seemed like a foregone conclusion. That was 40+ years ago.My gut sense is that we’re finally getting over a significant hump, namely taking space exploration solely out of the public domain and empowering commercial enterprises to lower costs, get the engineering right, spread the risk and innovate not just scientific, but business solutions.Currently, globally, we launch fewer than 100 rockets per year to orbitThe most accurate answer is that there’s just no way to know for certain.When we successfully landed humans on the moon (for the 6th time), human habitation throughout the solar system seemed like a foregone conclusion. That was 40+ years ago.My gut sense is that we’re finally getting over a significant hump, namely taking space exploration solely out of the public domain and empowering commercial enterprises to lower costs, get the engineering right, spread the risk and innovate not just scientific, but business solutions.Currently, globally, we launch fewer than 100 rockets per year to orbital velocities. I believe there is a strong correlation between number of launches and ability to support off-Earth habitats. The Earth satellite industry, Defense and ISS currently dominate launch manifests.But that is changing. More launch capacity is coming online due to SpaceX, China and traditional players, also because commercial providers can sell remnant payload capacity to startups, and also because there is a resurgence of interest in and willingness to invest in space. Most importantly, along with an increase in global launches is a decrease in launch costs due to competitive pressures.The low-energy transfer window to Mars only opens every two years, and we need to send A LOT of stuff there to have any chance of preparing for human arrival, despite the deltaV requirements limiting how much payload we can bring. My guess is that when SpaceX finally announces their specific Mars plan, it will eventually include launching multiple rockets in a compressed time-frame.Once we see a year with 200+ rocket launches, I think we can start getting more confident that humans on Mars is happening.
