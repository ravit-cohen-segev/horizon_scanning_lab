It predicts the exact same outcomes of experiments as every other interpretation, and mathematically it is very cumbersome to actually solve for the hidden variables.The great advantage offered by Bohmian mechanics is that it supplies quantum mechanics with a clear ontology. It translates quantum processes into nice, visualize-able scenes. The picture is this:Most physicists don't see the use of it. It predicts the exact same outcomes of experiments as every other interpretation, and mathematically it is very cumbersome to actually solve for the hidden variables.The great advantage offered by Bohmian mechanics is that it supplies quantum mechanics with a clear ontology. It translates quantum processes into nice, visualize-able scenes. The picture is this:As an illustration, we can look at the quantum double slit experiment. The Bohmian interpretation argues that as the particle approaches the slits, it creates ripples in the pilot wave which propagate ahead through both slits. The pilot wave oscillations emerging from both slits superimpose and interfere. The particle then passes through one slit or the other (not both) and rides the pilot wave pattern to the screen.Example trajectories are plotted in the image, where you can see the pilot wave focusing the trajectories towards the observed maxima.So, this is the picture. Why isn't it more popular among physicists? Well, like I said at the start, it is hard to solve for the trajectories and the evolving pilot wave. You can kinda tell from the picture above that those trajectories aren't nice closed form functions. It's much easier just to solve for the wave function, or to calculate a Feynman path integral. Besides, knowing the trajectories doesn't tell us any observable information that these simpler approaches lack. Experimentally, nothing new is gained from knowing the trajectory of the particleAnother bigger issue is the problem of non-locality. The Bell experiments on entangled systems demonstrate that the pilot wave must be non-local (i.e. disturbances in the pilot wave propagate faster than light).Non-locality is a serious issue to many physicists, as physical reality appears to be constrained by a maximum speed limit. Anything that violates this speed limit, such as virtual particles, shadows, etc, is taken to be devoid of physical substance. If the pilot wave is non-local, then it seems like it is just a mathematical artifact of the theory -- much like virtual particles -- rather than a physical system in and of itself.For me personally, I reject Bohmian mechanics because think it is philosophically unsatisfying to bring classical baggage into the quantum world. Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory -- it is the correct theory that matches all the predictions.  Classical physics is the derived theory that is wrong on many predictions. We should be understanding classical physics on quantum terms rather than vice-versa.","57,706 followers",Jack Fraser-Govil,1.2K,2.6K,42.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Bohmian-Mechanics-receive-more-attention

But, considering strong traditions of commitment, honesty and openness of the Russian government, many people don’t believe that. After all, better be safe than sorry.Long-standing history of such abuse, in a combination with poor living conditions, is a strong motivator to avoid army service at all cost.",0 followers,Alexander Novikov,1.1K,76,608.1K,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Bohmian-Mechanics-receive-more-attention
3,"On average 250,000 young Russian men get conscripted every year, around 1 million are called for selection and over 50% are rejected, the remaining are called in the next season, so contrary to popular belief, most young Russians are not even selected for service.

Only around 5,000 people avoid the draft per year and only around 500 of those are actually fined for it.Now why do this minority avoids it? Well, because it’s an obstacle in their life, of course. It’s primarily young people from big cities who loathe the idea of having to serve because spending one year in the middle of nowhere with no entertainment whatsoever with a bunch of guys he never met in his life. Majority of provincial guys are completely fine with conscription service, most of our professional servicemen in the assault groups are primarily from the provinces.Mandatory service is not only obligatory but the person can get conscripted till the person is 27 years old, so actually avoiding it is not easy, I’m actually in favor of decreasing the limit conscription age to 22, so the person can get his degree in whatever he wants and be free from conscription forever, the 27 age limit is obviously a Soviet method where if the person is not aiming for a PhD then he must be in the military to defend against the Western threat and back in the Soviet days the conscription was three years long, these days it’s just 12 months. Still we have a thing called “Alternative Civilian Service” where the person can simply do a year of compulsory work in social services such as the post office or healthcare clinics and never have to do military service at all. College students can also continue their studies in military universities instead and work as researchers or technicians in the military with proper salaries that usually surpasses the salaries of the average servicemen.Is it bad?Since 1998, a decree was enacted that states that conscripts can’t be put in warzones (Syria) or “hotposts” (North-Caucasus) under any circumstances, so no real risks to his life. In 2013,In 2008 there were large reforms to end hazing and improve the living conditions of the military facilities, they enacted a law against hazing and installed CCTV cameras in nearly every facility, not only to eradicate hazing but also eradicate corruption. Superiors can’t touch conscripts under any circumstances, conscripts themselves can report any dissatisfaction they have to the military affairs office, plus there are physical inspections every other week to make sure their health is ok. Since 2013 all sergeants are professional servicemen under contract, so no chances of hazing or “dedovshchina” happening, no sergeant would put his career on the line or risk getting arrested.There’s no internet or Netflix, true, smartphones are also prohibited, skype with family only on the weekends, TV is usually on our military channel or news channel, they can choose any channel only during recreational hours, the “payment” is also nonexistent, just 2,000 roubles (30 USD) a month, unless they specialize in a job, so they can actually receive an actual payment that starts from 20,000 rubles (200 USD).But it’s not bad, people just don’t wanna be forced to do it, which is fair enough.The mandatory service is mainly because we need large amounts of manpower to do menial but critical work that keeps our military running and we try to create an environment where they can execute those tasks smoothly so the professional servicemen can focus in being proficient at their specializations. The borders are just too large and the Soviet Union left a gigantic amount of equipment behind, as much the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and officers would like to move to a purely professional contract force, these young men do a crucial and invaluable duty in helping keep this nation safe and we’re grateful for their service.","43,153 followers",Misha Firer,613,1.3K,132.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Bohmian-Mechanics-receive-more-attention

It was calculated that if the money was spent instead on healthcare, average lifespan of Russian citizens would increase by 2.5 years.“Vasili Goes Military” is the best effort so far. Because of secret technologies shown in the movie, international distribution rights are given only to Cuba, North Korea,Venezuela, and areas of Syria under control of Assad.I give synopsis to Westernsky who cannot watch this masterpiece that has won nineteen Gold Kalashnikov award. It is first part of trilogy “Win. Winner. Winnest.”Main character is Vasili is drafted to russky brutalsky army. Vasili’s mother had crowd-funded online to collect 10,000 rubles to pay bribe to dodge, but she fell short 3,469 rubles.Vasili is sent to elite Rocket and Missile Range Garrison in Moscow Oblast. On the first night,Vasili gets a gram of hash through his mother, butDediCaptain demands 10 grams of hash to save Vasili’s a$$. Vasili promises he’ll pay later with interest. In the meantime, his mother has been working hard behind the scenes to get her son a transfer to even better military post in navy, on cruiser “Beriya.” Mother is forced to sell her 23 square meter family apartment on the fifth floor without elevator to pay off captain.Cruiser “Beriya” is Soviet and very big but understaffed because of army dodging and shrinking male population. Funds for Navy is systematically ransacked by minister of defence Serdyuchka and his greedy girlfriend so light bulbs are in serious shortage. Bulbs not like your Westernsky energy-saving spiral things, I mean energy-devouring, bulbous, brittle with a filament hanging in ether.When time to practice manoeuvres, sailors battle each other for light bulbs. Vasili again on the receiving end. He lose fist fight and the corridor to his room is unlit. He stumbles through darkness and falls through a hole like in Star Wars and lands in an abandoned section. His right leg is broken. He cries for help, but all in vain.Vasili is attacked by hungry rats and finds skeletons of other sailors who had died before him.Luck is on his side. Cruiser is attacked by rogue drones. Sailors run around the deck screaming “Devils’ fly machines!” and fire at them with kalashnikovs. Some of the missiles are inoperable. Cannons are rusty. Priests spray holy water to drive drones away.A direct hit below deck allows Vasili to escape. He gets into a rescue boat, which is saved by Americansky cruiser five days later but only after the survivors have eaten one of their dead comrades.When Vasili sees American flag, he tries to drown himself, but is too late. When mother finds out that her son has been captured by the enemy, she denounces him no matter how much TV people tried to explain that Vasili was merely picked up in the open sea.Vasili is seriously shocked by Americansky cruiser. Sailors exercise in the state of the art gym, play computer games on Play Station, eat three times a day, and get paid thousands of dollars a month.Back on “Beriya,” Vasili and his perpetually hungry comrades spent their days fighting for bulbs and trying not to break their necks in dark corridors.When the cruiser passes by Russian oligarch’s super-yacht, Americansky ask if the oligarch can take his compatriots on board. He refuses and quickly steams away from the cruiser.Next day, the event happens. From a secret military base in Kamchatka the super-weapon SsiKoon is launched. A pyramid-shaped protoplasmic bomb containing at least a thousand Hiroshima explosions in its core travels at near the speed of light warping time and space.As it traverses blue sky, Vasili and his comrades shed tears of joy, lifestyle comparisons gone out of their minds for good. Vasili begins to sing a patriotic song and his comrades join in with him.This is russky super-weapon and it works, which means the obvious: his country is the best in the world. Vasili is a proud citizen, soldier, and sailor of his heroic nation.The super-weapon explodes and a big mushroom rises above the waves. What country has just been wiped out? It is not clearly stated, but judging by sudden commotion on board is not hard to guess.“Katyusha” plays.

So I can give you only a very generalized answer.Hello and thanks for the A2A, Tufshin!It is impossible to speak for all Russians. So I can give you only a very generalized answer.In big cities young men usually don’t want to “waste” a year in military in the middle of nowhere. They prefer to spend this year “more useful” instead. That’s what I hear rather often. However, if a young man wish to serve in police but doesn’t want to go to a police academy, he must have military experience.In rural areas young men join military more willingly.

He was dismissed from the Air Force.On May 20th 2022, Botashov celebrated his 63rd birthday when his dream finally came true: still without a permission and experience to fly a fighter jet, he was formally given a Su-25 to fight Neo-nazis in Ukraine because most of his fellow pilots had already been killed in action or refused to serve in the special military operation.Yes, the fighter jet was so old that it was actually on active duty in the Soviet-Afghan War, subsonic, with just one seat, but it was all his, Botashov’s, and nobody would ever tell him he can’t fly it.On May 22, Ukraine Army Air Defence Brigade Unit shot down Botashov’s Su-25 with a Stinger.Kalamat Botashev died a happy man.Dreams come true if you believe (and not necessarily work hard).","43,153 followers",Misha Firer,1.2K,1.3K,132.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Russians-avoid-military-service-Is-it-that-bad

Entertainment was by going to one of the three movie houses in town. The cheapest seats were the first five rows, only the really poor kids sat there.The rear of the upper balcony, near totally dark, was for the more adventurous couples.Bikinis had not come to town yet, but some girls had one-piece swimsuits made of spandex, highly appreciated by many in the communal swimming pool or on the beach.Our music “Rock Around the Clock, (Bill Haley 1954) was hated by all over 25, but who cared?Very few drank, it was not a “thing” yet. Sure, some boys got drunk at the Saturday dances but they were in the minority.In spite of the condom machines in the boy’s bathroom at the high school, the odd girl got pregnant and dropped out of school.I was careful with my money and bought a Russian made Moskvitch, once I turned 18 and got my driver's license.","10,891 followers",Bengt Lindvall,2.2K,22.4K,38M,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Bohmian-Mechanics-receive-more-attention

26,"I was a teen in the mid 1970s-early 1980s.So, the only tech we really had were stereo equipment, color television with no cable, a rotary phone, and radios. In the 1980s we had primitive portable tech like the Walkman and boomboxes. Car radios with a cassette tape player were fairly common.We had no internet, so there was no social media, no streaming, no video games. No personal computers existed. We had no cellphones.Because we didn’t have all that stuff, I got to do the following:I was a teen in the mid 1970s-early 1980s.So, the only tech we really had were stereo equipment, color television with no cable, a rotary phone, and radios.

Car radios with a cassette tape player were fairly common.We had no internet, so there was no social media, no streaming, no video games. No personal computers existed. We had no cellphones.Because we didn’t have all that stuff, I got to do the following:We had one phone for the whole family and it was a landline. Nobody had their own phones with their own lines unless they were rich or spoiled—I didn’t have my own phone until I went away to college and even then I shared a phone with my roommate. To make a phone call and to maintain more than one line was expensive. Parents yelling at kids about the phone calls they made was a thing since long distance calls were charged separately than local. There was no such thing as voicemail, so if someone called and you weren’t home, the person answering the phone took a message—you had a pad and pen next to the phone for that purpose. If nobody was home, you called back later.There was also accepted etiquette as far as using the phone. Unless it was an emergency, you couldn’t call people early in the morning, late at night, or during the dinner hour—it was considered rude to do so. So if you got phone calls they were at limited times during the day and early evening and only when you were actually at home. Of course those rules are pretty much nonexistent now with cell phones and you are constantly connected.Since there were no personal computers, you had to use typewriters if you were writing a report for school. The teachers expected clean copies—no strikeouts, and in some cases, no liquid paper. Typing a paper was a chore. If you weren’t a good typist, you paid someone to type your papers for you if you were a college student. We did take typing classes in high school, and nobody really saw the point of knowing how to type, since back then only secretaries needed to know how to type.You wrote everything down since there was no such thing as smartphones or tablets where you could store numbers or make appointments. You marked calendars with appointments, you had address books for contacts (that’s where the term “little black book” comes from—it was a phone/address book single men who were playboys kept with their girlfriends numbers in them).TV was limited to three or four main channels with other offbeat channels nobody really watched like the Spanish channel or local channels, so everyone watched the same shows. There were three main networks: CBS, ABC and NBC. They carried the bulk of all of the television shows and sports programs people looked at.TV also wasn’t 24/7. After about 4am, the stations would play the national anthem and stop broadcasting. You got to stare at something like this if you couldn’t go to bed:If you are older than I am, this is probably what you looked at:Because streaming didn’t exist and the VCR didn’t become a thing until after I left my teens, if you wanted to see a movie you had to monitor the TV guide in order to catch it if it wasn’t a current movie. I watched a lot of old movies as a teen, and I remember waking up at 2–3am with my dad at times to see certain films we liked because that was the only time you could see it. There was no such thing as 24/7 news until CNN came on line in the 80s. Unless something unusual happened, the news was limited to maybe midday, 5–6pm, and 11pm, and typically the news program would last an hour. If you missed those times, you had to get a newspaper.Radio was pretty similar to TV-a few stations that controlled what music you got to hear. Music was far more segmented then and broke down largely by race and age, more so than today. Rock was something the white kids listened to, R&B/funk was what black kids listened to, ethnic music was largely confined within those communities, and older people listened to certain groups. Kids didn’t really listen to the same groups their parents did. Since you couldn’t download music you went to a record store and bought albums. You couldn’t really buy records with just one song on it unless it was a massive hit, so you were stuck buying an entire album just for one song. Sometimes, it worked out and the rest of the album was good, and sometimes not—which was the reason “mix tapes” became a thing.And yes, print news as well as magazines were a thing. No computers meant you went to a newsstand and bought a daily paper, or you had it delivered by a neighborhood kid.All in all, life was much simpler, and in some ways better, some ways worse. You had less distractions so you were able to cultivate hobbies and learn skills because you had the time.",UNKNOWN,"Endless, Nameless",3.3K,380,1.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Russians-avoid-military-service-Is-it-that-bad

The swamp had a huge pipe you could walk down. We saw a lot of critters in the swamp. Sometimes we’d get some cattails or pollywogs. We learned quickly to stay away from skunk weed though. Nasty smelling stuff. The river had an undertow so no swimming but you could fish. I think I got a fishing pole for my birthday when I was 6 or 7.We learned to play pinochle at a really young age so we could “sit in” when an adult had to go to the bathroom or just needed a break.

30,"I’m distinctly thinking of a time when I was maybe 16 or 17, and I was with my family at an amusement park. A couple of us decided we wanted to go on one last ride before we went home, but there was a minor miscommunication about where we were supposed to meet. We ended up wandering around for the better part of an hour, each group getting increasingly pissed at the other, until we finally managed to find each other, and all went home late, exhausted, and in a lousy mood.I remember that, because a couple of years later, I was flying to visit my sister who was picking me up at the airport, andI’m distinctly thinking of a time when I was maybe 16 or 17, and I was with my family at an amusement park.

We ended up wandering around for the better part of an hour, each group getting increasingly pissed at the other, until we finally managed to find each other, and all went home late, exhausted, and in a lousy mood.I remember that, because a couple of years later, I was flying to visit my sister who was picking me up at the airport, and this time we both had cell phones. I was waiting outside the terminal, gave her a call, and it turned out she was waiting at the other terminal. When we figured this out, she popped over a picked me up, and almost no time was lost. It struck me, very notably, at that moment, that the evening would have turned into a long, drawn-out game of trying to figure out where the other person was, waiting, dragging luggage around the huge airport, her circling through traffic, and both of use getting angrier and angrier until we finally managed to stumble onto where the other one was. But none of that happened, because we both carried phones.Now, these are pretty small incidents, but the point, and the overall principle, is that a lot of things are just smoother and easier now, that were major irritants and time sucks before. I liken modern communication to modern plumbing. Sure, people can live by walking to the well every day, drawing water, hauling it home, and going outside every time you need to pee. But that means a substantial part of your life is based around hauling water and throwing out waste. Life just flows more smoothly when you can simply turn a knob and have fresh, clean water flow out. In the same way, we can kludge together ways to coordinate with other people, but it was a massive pain a lot of the time, wasted a lot of time and effort, and just made life slightly but constantly more unpleasant.So, what was life like then? Much like now, except somewhat harder and more annoying.And look, I’m the first to say we get too dependent on all of our technologies, and should at least know how to function without them. But we use these things for a reason. They make our lives better it key and objective ways. Some of these ways are pretty much trivial, some are literally life and death, but there are so many of them that almost no one would want to go back to the way it was, given a chance.","112,398 followers",Yishan Wong,3.4K,1.6K,28.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Russians-avoid-military-service-Is-it-that-bad

Our website with 12 languages, which offers information about moving to Finland and living here, relies heavily on professional translators, so every three years or so we must publish an invitation for tenders. I cannot go into the particulars, but it has been a huge process we have been preparing since last February, with the aim of being able to sign a contract with a translation agency by February 2020, when our current contract will expire.Other than that, we are cooperating with the University of Helsinki now in September, in order to improve our content aimed at international students.Next week, we will be presenting our website in the Municipal Fair, an annual event of Finnish public administration. The idea is to offer information and opportunities for people from all around Finland about things that have to do with municipal administration, and our role is to inform representatives of the municipalities involved about the website, so that they could benefit from cooperation instead of starting from the scratch.And not related to work, I will organize a birthday party for my child the upcoming weekend, first for the family, later for his friends (the date is not scheduled, yet). I feel a bit disheartened about that, since I have been suffering from some health problems lately, and coping with all the dietary restrictions will be frustrating to combine with all the baking and cooking.Naturally I am also working on finding out the root causes for the aforementioned problems. Some fun definitely in the offing.Luckily I have survived some intensive weeks helping my child first to complete her virtual herbarium on Instagram for school (26 plants, two photos of each, and mostly mosses and lichen that grow deep in the forest that had to be found with some detective work), and then to pack a huge backpack for her to spend three days and two nights in the forest, sleeping in a tent (another school assignment). And then they say Finnish children don’t have homework!In a more general sense, I am trying to read and compose more and spend a bit less time on Quora. So far I haven’t been too successful in that. The autumn is approaching, and I would also like to take long promenades in the nearby seashore and in the forests, both alone and with friends.Here on Quora, I hope to get some more Left Brain stuff done, once we get past all the birthday hassle.Oh, and the conductor of my daughter’s orchestra asked if I was willing to participate, too, playing the old-fashioned pump organ.
