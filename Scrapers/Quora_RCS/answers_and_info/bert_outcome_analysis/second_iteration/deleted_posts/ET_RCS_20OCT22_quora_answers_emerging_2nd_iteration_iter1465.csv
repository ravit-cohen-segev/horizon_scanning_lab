Read the comments as well please.This is a tough question, but let me try to break it down in a way that clarifies it. Let’s say that all babies are born with the exact same level of intelligence (this isn’t the case, but let’s keep things simple). None of them can speak, control their movements, have any idea of anything (all arguable, but let's go with it lol), etc.However, there are unseen differences between babies that will lead certain individuals to be more or less intelligent than average. There are MANY biological traits that confer to one's intelligence, let's pick a common, easy one: brain plasticity.Plasticity is the brain's ability to create (and destroy) connections between neurons. Our genetics determine how plastic our brains are (like it or not). A person born with better plasticity than another person, is highly likely to be more intelligent. Now, many would argue (and probably will), that with practice, one can improve their own brain's plasticity. I agree, this IS possible, but, how much one's plasticity can be improved upon, depends, once again, on your genetics. 2 hrs of ""plastic training"" may increase one person's plasticity by 50% but only 10% in another person.Now, having said that, let's talk about nurture. We all like to believe that a nurturing environment is ultimately what determines a person's intelligence. This is partially true. A nurturing environment is only going to push a person to their genetic limit. Harsh, I know, but hear me out. If you take a person who has a low IQ, no matter how much nurturing you provide, that individual will never reach genius level. In fact, if you take an average IQ person and provide a nurturing environment, they still won't reach genius level. They will improve, yes, but genius? They will never be. (True geniuses are rare occurrences and often times, the differences (if any) in their brains is not obvious.) On the flip side of that coin, there are those whose biological traits destine them to be intelligent. For example, the person who goes to a bad school system and isn't nurtured at home, displays intelligence that rivals the greatest minds that have walked the earth.So, now that I've talked about the exceptions, let's talk about the average person. Most of us will have average intelligence and due to our genetic traits, some of us will be better than others in various areas. For many of us, a proper environment will push us to our intellectual limits.This is all to say that we were born with the same level intelligence, but not with the same level of, what I call, ""intellectual potential"".So, to answer your question, let me first rephrase it:Are some people born with moreAbsolutely.Their environment will determine how much of that potential is reached.",499 followers,Mikel Graham,2.9K,107,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-more-intelligent-than-others

There’s some truth in all of the posts. I’d rather tell you my own truth though: Everyone’s an idiot.Humans? Idiots.We’re all idiots. You’re an idiot. I’m an idiot. Anyone with an opinion is an idiot.Trust me when I tell you that someone reading this is going to have a very real emotional reaction and start crying that the only idiot here is me, and that they can’t possibly be an idiot because “reasons” that they will invariably make lists of. Let me point out ahead of time, those are the biggest idiots of all.Take a deep breath, hate me if you must; but, listen anyway.You’ve asked, “why are some people more intelligent than others?” and the biggest factor that I have found in life is ego.Now, you can debate till the cows come home whether ego is derived from nature or nurture or some vague combination of the two. Let me set that aside for the sake of this conversation only because trying to figure out the source of self is not only a separate topic, but one that would take even longer to write about.I’m going to start somewhere else entirely and that is to first define a few words. But wait you say? How dare I come up with my own definitions of things? Think of it more as clarifying the terms being used. Many words have multiple meanings and when you start talking about synonyms the meanings get even more blurry.Language is a fluid thing, so if everyone in the discussion is not viewing the use of a word in the same way than your entire point will be lost on many of the people you are interacting with.First I take issue with the word “intelligence” itself. In common conversation many people translate this as “smart”; most dictionaries will list them as synonyms. Yet in critical usage they aren’t always the same thing. In military or government documentation intelligence is “information”.Gather intel? Intelligence by and large is simply a volume of information. How intelligent one human being is compared to another is often a question of how much one person knows more than another. Thing is that information may be highly specific, or broad without being specific enough and more to the point of this conversation it’s frequently common that even when people know things they may have no idea how to make use of it.See where I’m going yet? Being intelligent just means you know a lot. It doesn’t mean you are smart and it doesn’t mean you have any idea how to use that intelligence. There’s a lot of smart, dumb people in the world.Dumb, there’s another word people misuse. Dumb is not a lack of intelligence, it’s not even the state of being stupid. Why do so many people mistake dumb as being stupid? Synonyms again, for some reason an idiot decided that stupid and dumb were the same thing and a bunch of other idiots believed him.If you’re smart you already see where I’m going with this. If you’re stupid than you are quite possibly annoyed with me and tired of me calling you an idiot.Idiot:Human. The condition of being human, having an ego. Allowing emotions to occasionally make choices where logic should prevail. By extension; Bigger idiot: the condition of always (rather than occasionally) allowing emotion and ego to make your choices, never rationalizing decisions and a complete lack of the ability to use logic correctly.Intelligence:A measure of how much information a person has. This is (to me) purely about volume. Lots of people know lots of things. Sometimes that information is very niche, sometimes that information is very broad. The opposite of intelligence is ignorance. No one is ignorant of everything. Everyone is ignorant of something. The biggest mistake people make when using the term intelligence is pretending it means the same thing as smart. The biggest mistake people make when using the term ignorant is to assume it means ignorant of everything when it typically only means ignorant of something specific.Note: IQ (intelligence quotient) is not 100% the same thing as “intelligence”; the quotient of a persons intelligence is an attempt at measuring things, debate the value of that on your own time.Dumb:The inability to communicate something. In medical terms “dumb” actually indicates a person who can not speak. “Deaf and dumb” means unable to hear or speak. In broader terms dumb or “dumb struck” is someone unable to articulate something. A person may be of high intelligence, possibly even really smart; but, if they can’t communicate that information then they are dumb. Somewhere along the line (of life) idiots decided dumb was a synonym for stupid. The reality is a dumb person can not effectively show off if they are smart or stupid because they lack the ability to communicate well either due to physical, emotional or other intellectual barriers (mental, physical or otherwise). The opposite of dumb is articulate. Good speakers and communicators are often perceived as smart. Technically these should be understood as distinct traits. There are some profoundly stupid people who are still effective and articulate speakers. And there are some incredibly smart people who are dumb and terrible at sharing their thoughts with the world.Smart:That leaves us with the hardest one to define. It’s easy to first state that the opposite of smart is stupid. Forest Gump popularized the phrase “Stupid is as stupid does”. It basically means that a person's common sense (or lack of) is evidenced by the person's actions. In other words, a stupid person is a person who does stupid things. A smart person is a person who does smart things.At this point you might be asking: “What does any of this have to do with the original question?”Well, I’m an idiot but I do have a point to make. Bear with me if you can.The original question is:The really short answer is: because some people took the time to gather more information than others.That’s a very subjective answer. Intelligence being a volume of information, in effect asking why do some people have more gathered information than other people. That’s a factor of time and interest, how much did one collect versus another.But you would dismiss my answer out of hand if you didn’t realize I had more to say.I don’t think the point was to actually ask about intelligence. I think what’s being asked is “Why are some people smarter than others?” which is technically a side step of the original question if you take the time to bother defining the words in use rather than blindly believing the synonyms that idiots (humans) have put in place over time.So, why are some people smarter than others? That’s the question most people already attempted to answer in other answer posts, whether they bothered to define words for clarity or not; most will supplant smart with intelligent as a synonym. I can’t fault them for that exactly; we’re all idiots, we all make these mistakes when we don’t take the time to apply logic and the best among us (humanity) can generally only rise above that for brief moments.A side issue of course is speed of thought, that’s a combination of physical limitations (handicaps) and training. How many choices we’ve made to enhance the speed of our thinking process. There are learned shortcuts, but that’s another topic for discussion.Which brings us full circle to my point: Ego; or more to the point choices we make based on our own arrogance.I can’t tell you what goes into making one human brain different from another at birth. I’ll let some scientist or doctor attempt to explain the nature of brain plasticity and hormonal physiology. What I can tell you is that the choices we make after birth; once we’re aware of being able to make choices will ultimately determine how much of your individual potential is ever reached.And the nurturing we receive either from family or community will be the tipping point for how soon we figure out that we have those choices.So there’s your starting point. Nature through DNA, brain plasticity, hormonal levels present at birth and whatever other magic words (joke) some scientist or doctor wants to invent(discover) gives you some vague concept of how vast any particular humans potential can be. And aside from brain damage, mutations, mental handicaps and other things that impair a humans potential for brain function there’s no real way of knowing what the maximum potential for any human really is until pushed to the limits.Humans are really good at measuring each others short comings. On the whole we aren’t very good at realizing our full potential, but you should forgive them for that; they are idiots after all.What carries us beyond these natural limitations are the choices we make in life. Nurture, how soon we are brought to realize that we have choices; how soon it comes that having an open mind and open heart (oooh philosophy! ~ almost joke), will lead you further in life.Smart people take the time to see all of their options. They gather intelligence. They listen to other articulate smart people. They realize they are idiots (humans) and that they are going to make mistakes. But they keep seeing that they have more options beyond that. They choose to keep learning.It is these choices that make a person smart.Humans are all idiots, they have a tendency towards emotional rather than rational thinking. Humans begin life ignorant of everything. Humans begin life very susceptible to influence and if they are taught to be close minded early it may remain with them for life.Smart people are shown early enough in life that they can make choices to rise above these potential limitations.Ignorance is only a problem if you can’t admit you are ignorant. Do something about it. Choose to learn new things, choose to educate yourself about new topics, broaden your knowledge, be intelligent. You don’t have to know everything, but you also shouldn’t stop learning.Being dumb is only a problem until you learn to articulate. Choose to find an outlet for expressing yourself. Whether you choose public speaking, writing, painting or some other form of scholastic or artistic expression the point is that a smart person chooses to find ways to share who and what they are instead of being hindered by whatever life has thrown in their way. You don’t have to master all of them, but don’t be a shut in.Stupid people remain closed minded and make ignorant choices based on limited information.Stupid people take offense to being called idiots. They can’t rationalize their own short comings.Stupid people take offense to being called ignorant; instead of realizing that maybe they are ignorant of a specific topic and need to learn more about it.Stupid people take offense to being called dumb, rather than realize maybe they did not communicate themselves properly in what they were trying to say.Stupid people are quickly frustrated by failure because they would rather give up and justify their laziness by claiming whatever they failed at was too hard, rather than learning how to overcome.Stupid people choose to not see the options they have for changing each and every one of these conditions. Why? They weren’t taught to realize they had other options.Why can’t they change their minds and learn later in life? Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. That hearkens back to potential. I don’t know that there is a way to truly quantify human potential. I only know of ways to quantify how far someone has come, not how far they still have to go.I do know that no matter who they are; they can change that potential by making new choices. The question at that point becomes: “are they capable of making those choices?”.I don’t know, depends on how big an idiot they are.(If you didn’t laugh at that, you have failed to understand any point I was attempting to make ~ feel free to hate me for it instead of realizing why)Beyond this point I’m rambling (as if I wasn’t already…?).Perhaps these were all superficial points. But we live in a reality where rationalizing smart versus stupid is already a superficial concept.What difference does it make how smart or stupid anyone is? (don’t answer that)From one human to another the variance is of little value because only the application truly matters in the long rung. What someone applies their life too will ultimately have more relevance than how actually smart they are.Some of the stupidest people in the world have had the most profound effect simply because they were able to leverage what (minimal) intelligence (information) they had to spread their message (articulate) in a way that swayed the (idiot) masses.While some of the smartest people in the world are unable to make use of their (theoretically massive) intelligence (gathered information) because they are too dumb (unable to articulate) to find a way to disseminate their ideas to anyone capable of making use of them.The variables are all there; the rest is the choices we make.Choices are what make one person smarter than another. How much information one has gathered makes one person more intelligent (less ignorant of specific things) than another. Social anxieties and physical issues relegate how dumb versus how articulate one person is compared to another (choices will change the venue of articulation).Ego decides what choices we can make. Do we shelter in place and shut out our minds to outside influences? Do we remain ignorant, bigoted, and shut in from the world? Do we choose to keep learning, keep trying, keep expanding our intelligence?Or do we choose to just believe we are already as smart as we can be?Somewhere in there is your answer. The stupid people chose to stop becoming more intelligent. Probably because they were too busy protecting their own ego to admit that they are idiots and still have something left to learn.The geniuses of the world figured out how to make wise choices and overcome their own idiocy while articulating their decisions and leveraging their (gathered) intelligence.Addendum:If it wasn’t clear enough none of these words are binary:Smart versus stupidIntelligent versus ignorantArticulate versus dumbThey are all subjective to individual topics and context. You can be intelligent in some topics while being ignorant in others. You can be very articulate in some forms of expression and a complete dumb ass in others. And you can make very smart choices in some areas of life while making stupid decisions in others.It’s still all choices and those choices are constrained by emotional boundaries (ego). I wonder where that came from… (or maybe I already know and just don’t want to tell you….)","15,984 followers",RN Sreenathan,1.1K,184,3.1M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-more-intelligent-than-others

Is this right or can we have another definition of intelligence which is altogether different from the above definition? Let us find out at the end of this post.Einstein was a very intelligent man because he could think what others couldn’t. Newton was a very intelligent man for the same reason. William Shakespeare was certainly a very intelligent man for he found words from nowhere effortlessly.Neuro-scientists wanted to find out the reason behind the intelligence of Einstein. They took pains to obtain legal permission to preserve his brain. Some neuro-scientists (Berkely) worked on his brain and couldn’t see much difference between the neurons of the brain of Einstein and an idiot! This became very puzzling. Finally, one scientist came out with a theory that the ratio of neuroglia to neurons was high in the case of Einstein’s brain. Suddenly, neuroscientists got excited.What are these neuroglia?The picture above shows an astrocyte which is a neuroglia . The increased ratio of neuroglia to the neurons is one of the theories of intelligence, though not a substantiated one. Is there a way to increase our intelligence? Read on…The neuroglia are non-neuronal cells of the brain specialized to protect, insulate, help in the ionic equilibrium of the neurons. They are 3 times the number of the neurons. The increased number of neuroglia naturally envisage an important function to them. However, of late, a serious research is going on with regard to neuroglia.Where is this intelligence ( the algorithmic hacking) located in the brain?It is not in a single neuron or neuroglia but, it perhaps, lies in the group of neurons employed as a unit when something is thought out. Let me give an example to make this clear. Imagine there are thousands of people assembled in a place to listen to the lecture of their favorite leader who has not yet arrived. All of them will be shouting and there is a constant din (let us call this cross -talk, as nothing is intelligible). Imagine, a spot light of a press interviewer is focused on the small group and conversation begins. The din (meaningless cross-talk) that was prevalent till then suddenly becomes an intelligent expression from a small group. In the same way, our brain is engaged in so many ideas, thoughts, plans, designs, requirements, policies, desires from all part of the brain at the same time, therefore, there is meaningless, purposeless noise prevalent which is an unintelligent outcome of the function of the brain.Take for example, an individual who can only think about one point at a given time, like Newton thought about the falling apple, the so called meaningless cross-talk becomes an intelligent expression from the collective action of a group of neurons (brain cells).People talk of genetics and its importance in being intelligent. There is no denying of that because a person who is born with the advantage of stimulating a group of neurons responsible for a desired action to the exclusion of the others, naturally performs better. This is a clear advantage.We are not much interested in those people who are born intelligent . We are interested in those individuals who are unable to focus and want to become intelligent now. We know that the brains of these unintelligent people produce constant cross-talk between various parts of the brain and therefore, they are unable to stimulate a particular group of neurons for a particular action. Because of this inability, they have become unintelligent.How to make the unintelligent intelligent?This is our challenge. It is possible. We can change the brain connections so that we can stimulate a particular group of neurons at will and become intelligent. We colloquially call this as ‘focus’.Is it possible to develop this focus?Focus is possible by discrimination. I have posted before about the prefrontal cortex several times. This part of the front of the brain has a supervisory role. It discriminates between good and bad, permanent and impermanent, valid and invalid thoughts. It is something like training the light-boy to focus the spotlight on a particular group of people. It steadily becomes a habit. Every individual has sane and insane thoughts. The problem is that insane thoughts take over the sane ones very easily because of distraction. Take for example, smartphone, tablets, laptops which are terrible distractions. They always drag us into the cross-talk of the whole brain. We steadily lose our ability to focus.Why can’t we focus while using cell phone?That is a splendid question. It focuses on the shapes and sounds of the present and make us get addicted to them and causes us to lose ability to pursue the algorithmic sequences. We cannot hack the brain to focus at all. The algorithmic sequences can be thought over and more and more algorithmic codes can be hacked if we keep searching for the group of neurons which have the ability to hack this code in our brain. It is possible only when we silence the unwanted activities of the brain. Imagine, you are working on a very great puzzle, and your friend comes and cajoles you to join him for a movie. This is what is happening to us on regular basis. We are evolving as ordinary individuals carried away by senses like a boat driven aimlessly by a tempest in the deep sea.What is the best way to become intelligent now, this moment?Use your prefrontal cortex and control the so called collective cross-talk of the brain. We have become ordinary, restless, useless, stressful, anxious, phobic (fearful) because of our inability to control this habituated cross-talk of the brain.Why are we habituated to this cross-talk of the brain as a whole?It is because we are following the dictates of the mind and its thoughts. We never question the sagacity of these thoughts. We are very easily distracted by the worldly materialistic objects and ego-kick.We do not know what is good for us. Even if we know, we don’t practice it. We have been converted into automatic zombies. That is the real problem.Why some are stressful?They have too many unfulfilled desires. The desires are continually populated by scientific advancement in producing comforts for the physical body, advertisement, imitation, emulation, and a strong desire to appease the senses. The discrimination of the prefrontal cortex suggests that all desires emanated out of the craving of senses are temporary and they can never be satiated permanently. That which has no permanent solution is dropped by the wise. The ability to drop certain desires increases our intelligence.Finally, the definition of intelligence has to be changed. Intelligence is not cheating people by nice words and enjoying physical pleasures at any cost but dropping certain desires and increasing our ability to explore the unmanifest.Thank You.Dr R N SreenathanDirector Chinmaya International FoundationVedantin; NeuroscientistImage Credits:relation of neuroglia to neuronsAstrocyte - Wikipedia",172 followers,Ryan Gilpatric,7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-more-intelligent-than-others

DNA differs from person to person and every single quality a human being might have will differ from person to person, within the range that natural selection has determined is functional for our species.Some think faster or better, some run faster or better, some are taller or shorter or paler or darker or have better fine motor control or more endurance or a better metabolism or a heart that won’t clog up with cholesterol by age 50. There is no quality of the human body, including the function of the brain, that does not have a continuum in both type and efficiency. NO ONE excels in everything.You can throw environmental influences on top of that, but IMHO it’s just icing on the cake. Any complex species, anywhere on earth, has individuals that excel in different things, and no individual is “perfect” in everything.In a communal, cooperative species like ours, this can express more freely than in species where each individual has to function on its own. Society allows us to assign the most intelligent people to the tasks that require high intelligence, the most physically capable people to those most suited to that, the most enduring people to jobs requiring endurance, etc. Socially adept individuals will wind up in areas where that matters and socially inept people will wind up in other areas. Artisans may not ace the SAT or dig ditches, but they produce paintings and sculptures that enrich our lives. There is nothing better or worse about any particular skill, but when you put them all together, we as society can accomplish anything we need to.While I sit here with my strong intelligence, typing out a novel to earn a living, there are some guys in my back yard putting a rain block on the underside of my deck. The guy in charge has phenomenal spatial/visual ability and can picture how a custom job like that should be built, way better than I can. The guys working for him may not be what you would term “high intellect’, but they’re out there in the brutal heat lifting heavy beams and digging out posts from 9–5, which I could not do if my life depended on it. Neither, I suspect, could you. In the front of my house the garbage men are picking up my trash. I have no idea what they are like intellectually,but I’ve spoken to those guys, and I know they’d rather be outside hauling heavy trash in the rain and snow than have to sit still in an office for 8 hours pushing paperwork around. They seem like intelligent guys; they just don’t like to sit still.To coin an old cliche, “it takes all types to make the world go round.” For you, in your intellectual ivory tower, to wonder why people who lack the one particular capacity you excel in should even exist, is so limited in vision I’m embarrassed even responding to it. The next time an “intellectual inferior” does some job for you, ask yourself it you would be willing to do the same job 365 days a year, and if so, if you’d be good at it.

ItHumansNature, on the other hand, has absolutely no reason to be fair. Think about it: why on EarthOur human laws move us towards equality. Unfortunately, we can't do a thing about nature’s laws, and nature’s laws don't give a crap about that. Are we going to complain that some elements are made unstable and others aren't? That some planets are habitable and others aren't? That some stars are brighter than others, or longer-lived than others? Fairness is a human construct. It comes from our personal, selfish desire that we should have just as much chance at success as anyone else.So, you are correct: when nature crumbles the metaphorical cookie, it has absolutely no qualms about giving some people bigger bits. Success in life is also correlated with many other factors, including self-control, positive experiences, social aptitude and good planning, but there’s no denying that it is correlated also with intelligence, and that intelligence is influenced deeply by the million-dollar lottery of genetics.How do we reconcile this unfairness of nature with our human desire that everyone should be equal (or, in the terms which we only use inside our own heads—thatHere’s what I think is the answer. Be comfortable knowing that some people have better opportunities in life than you do—and focus instead on doing the best thatIt's difficult to think this way, because human nature—and the social constructs we’ve set up—are inclined to facilitate comparison. Thinking this way takes reminding. Often, though, if we focus on improving ourselves, and hold ourselves to our own highest standards, those comparative structures will work in our favour anyway.Set goals that only need your own approval to be achieved, or that are defined in terms of objective and non-comparative standards. Rather than ‘'I want to top my class and do it more easily than other people’, for example, think ‘'I want to do all the practice I need to do to get 95% on this upcoming exam’ and ‘'This semester, I want to do all my homework early and ask quality questions after each lesson’. Ask yourself, at the end of each day: Did I improve from yesterday?Yep, there will always be people who are smarter than you. Some of those people will be very much smarter than you. This is true at every level of smart unless you're a world-class genius, and peering up the totem pole is no fun.Just be the best person you can be. That’s what everyone is trying to do, no matter how smart.

Surely it’s a matter of application?Answer:As a reasonably healthy species with over 7 billion individuals we have a strong and healthy degree of genetic diversity.This means our genes give us a wide variety (usually but not always) across a spectrum of:Actually - thinking ability is highly complex. You may be great at mathematics, music and abstract thought, but poor at languages, visual graphics, and unstructured memory. Or visa versa. Some people are strong at visual learning and recall, some at verbal learning and recall, some at emotional and sensory learning and recall.Some people grasp abstract concepts readily, but struggle with visual imagery, or auditory recall.Some great composers could listen a whole piece of music once and reproduce it note perfect as a score.In short we would expect that genetic diversity across a population would result in geniuses and mentally handicapped when it comes to intelligence. We would expect some to be geniuses at music, chess, art, literature, maths, languages, and some to struggle badly at each of these things. Shakespeare is not Isaac Newton. Van Gogh is not Mozart. LeBron James is not Nadia Comaneci. And you and I are none of them, and no amount of application will change that.Although we may each bring something very valuable to the world by being ourselves.And no amount of application can possibly change that. The very idea is completely absurd.If application could turn a brilliant basketball player into a petite gymnast, a brilliant musical composer into Shakespeare, or any child into a Chess Grandmaster, then it would follow that anybody could be Isaac Newton, Einstein or Napoleon.Application can only develop what innate talent there is.Michael Jordan was a brilliant athlete and basketball player. But he still couldn’t make it as a baseball player.From the archives: The true story behind Michael Jordan's brief-but-promising baseball careerWell - OK - possibly if he had persisted for another three seasons he might have done.But that’s still a combination of massive talent together with huge application.So why would anyone think application by someone considerably less talented would succeed?Sure - application matters, but if application were all that mattered China would now have a billion geniuses.Genius is valued because it is rare. If application were sufficient to produce geniuses there’d be many hundred million of them.And for every genius, there’s someone at the other end of the IQ spectrum (remember that IQ is supposed to be normally distributed and is a potential, not a measure of trained intelligence).Hope this helps.","5,626 followers",Bruno Campello de Souza,1.9K,1.3K,16.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-more-intelligent-than-others

A genius, for instance, would likely be unhappy and unfulfilled working as a home health aid or grocery clerk because neither of these roles would use their intellectual capacity. However, many people with average or below average intelligence could be happy in these roles because they are able to be of service, contribute importantly through their efforts, and they are less driven to work in an area that fulfills their intellectual needs.Having very high intelligence actually makes learning, thinking, wondering, and analysis into actual needs for a person. They cannot be happy without using their abilities. Just like people with other talents need to use their talents to be happy… like using one’s emotional intelligence to have strong social ties or using ones aesthetic talent to make a beautiful home for ones family etc…Society doesn’t need a great number of geniuses because the number of roles available are fewer for this group than others.

Like many people have said over the years: 'you don't miss a thing, do you?'And the one thing I noticed is that some people's intelligence was noticed and some wasn't.Some kids intelligence was rewarded, other kids showed the exact same cleverness but because they were from a bad home, showed this cleverness in perhaps doing something the teacher thought was naughty.They were punished.The teacher thought he was punishing the behavior, what she really was doing was shutting the kid down, including his confidence and intelligence - hence more misbehavior next time.The kid was not doing what he was doing to be bad, but to show that he was just as clever as the kids she always praised.What the teacher should have done was praised his cleverness and then gradually he would have learned to focus it in academics -he would have started started seeking socially acceptable rewards like the middle class had already learned to do because of their home life and because of the pride their parents showed in them every second of every day.Childhood is the root of when intelligence gets developed or doesn't get developed.When I was in high school, certain kids were told they were going to college, other kids were encouraged not to go to college.Inevitably (in my town) it was always the kids with the nice clothes, pretty faces and respectable families that were encouraged to go to college. All others were told to learn a trade. It was sad for me to sit back and watch all this. I knew my own brain, and I knew that I was being judged by everyone including all my teachers on the wrong criteria: poverty, ugliness, and being different from everyone else. My teachers insisted on putting me in a non-regents class.I INSISTED for myself on being put in advanced classes. I advocated for myself. I remember they said, if you can get a teacher to sign this paper we'll let you do it. Well the teacher who I knew liked me was hesitant but he said I had a right to choose my life and so he signed it.For the first time I was opened to the world of actual knowledge instead of sitting in a class where you had to fill in the blanks for assignments and tests.I actually got to write essays, to use my brain to think, etc. If only I had gotten to go through all my high school years like that.But anyway, even though I was one of the kids who was told by everyone not to go to college, I did anyway and I graduated top in my class and won a scholarship to graduate school.The point of telling this story is that other people's perceptions have a lot to do with wether a person's intelligence get nurtured or gets shut down.Young people are very malleable and controlled. Freewill and standing up for yourself comes with maturity but many kids just accept the labels put on them.For most kids in my days anyway your own self opinion was not the driving factor of who you were, even if you thought that it was.I personally think high intelligence is a lot more common than what is thought. Mamy start off as intelligent but their intelligence is not nurtured or even noticed as babies, as toddlers, in school, by peers.Social fitness drives the world. Some parents, teachers and other authority figures are astute enough to pick up on and nurture intelligence and others simply are not- their perceptions are run by their own prejudices, life concerns or other values other than intelligence.The world itself is run by many other factors. So there is a place for everyone but it is sad that intelligence only gets nurtured and developed by a few.Like I said, this is not comprehensive.Genetics also plays a role of course and many other factors. I highlighted the one that I think is more significant than is acknowledged.","3,612 followers",Simon Chatzigiannis,2.7K,2.4K,8.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-more-intelligent-than-others

And let's not forget marijuana, which has recently been found to cause permanent IQ reduction of up to 9 points in teenage potheads -- enough to make the difference between a degree from a four-year college and a life as a laborer!Some of these factors have to do with early and even later environment. Studies find for example that the more educated the parents, the more words children are exposed to. There may be psychological factors as well, e.g., I was reading a discussion of the correlation between the INTJ personality type and high IQ, and it seems that we INTJ's are forced to think for ourselves from a very early age, possibly maximizing the potential of the brain for solving the kind of problem that is found on IQ tests.Then, there are other mental qualities which aren't reflected in an IQ test, which attempts to measure general intelligence. These could be musical ability, or spatial ability, or other subcategories of intelligence and they can and do vary independently from person to person. Again, it is very likely that these are a combination of heredity and environment, although as far as I know the evidence for this is more anecdotal than systematic. I've known some people who had prodigious intellects -- the kind that leave people in awe -- but who didn't score highly on IQ tests. Two well-known examples are JFK and the famous physicist Richard Feynman.I would take exception though to your statement that there's no place in the world for people of limited intellect. If we were all Einsteins, who would collect the trash? The brain is a metabolically hungry organ and a large head makes childbirth difficult. Both mean that there's an evolutionary penalty to increased intelligence that has to be balanced against the potential gains to a society.But beyond that, evolution is a messy process. Many genetic variants confer no obvious survival benefit. Some are effectively random. If one guy in a tribe has an IQ of 80 and another of 120, there may be no survival advantage for the guy with the higher IQ -- indeed, he may be more likely to die, owing to the metabolic needs of his (presumably) larger or more active brain. We're a group species and it seems to me that we do very well with a smattering of smart individuals. They can make their special contributions -- devising a strategy, or a new tool, say -- and the entire tribe benefits. Would it be efficient to have all smart people in the tribe, or would that metabolic energy better be expended on other qualities, such as strength, height, or athletic ability?It's like a football team -- you need a quarterback, but you need other kinds of player as well.99","1,896 followers",Jalon Fonseca,21.7K,485,5.1M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-more-intelligent-than-others

This is what most people think of when they think of the ""Deep web"". It is difficult to access, is creepy, and is therefore notorious. It consists primarily of pirated software and movies, drugs, guns, gambling, offers of contract murder, and illicit pornography. Avoid it. As a wise man once said, ""nothing good happens in that part of town after midnight"".The third and fourth layers are where you see the bulk of the traffic, and is where the truly interesting stuff lives. Most information on these layers of the ""deep web"" is hidden primarily because it is proprietary or classified. The bulk of deep traffic is on alternate and private networks (that is to say, corporate and government traffic). Layer three consists of classified information trafficked on alternative networks such as JWICS, SIPRNet, and NSANet. The fourth layer is internal corporate traffic hosted on private PANs, WANs and LANs, inaccessible unless you're already inside or that network is otherwise connected to the ""internet"" (the indexed, ""googleable"" surface web that we use every day).This information, by and large, is hidden because it is either useless to most people (or would be already indexed), illicit and therefore clandestine, or would be useful for the wrong kind of people, and hence is limited-access only. There are a lot of high-flung notions about what goes on on the deep web, and they are mostly overblown. There is a lot of sleazy shit available on the deep web, and it's to be avoided, but it represents a relatively small portion of deep web traffic.
