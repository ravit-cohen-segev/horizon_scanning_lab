2,"When I started my career post engineering from Delhi College of Engineering, I did not know how important it was to enjoy work. For me, at the age, money was all I needed from my job. I was in the merit list and got one of the most high paying jobs. I had an MBA offer from FMS too. But instant money lured me.But as I spent more years in corporate, I realized how if one does not enjoy work, every thing else does not give lasting happiness. I was not enjoying coding.

For me, at the age, money was all I needed from my job. I was in the merit list and got one of the most high paying jobs. I had an MBA offer from FMS too. But instant money lured me.But as I spent more years in corporate, I realized how if one does not enjoy work, every thing else does not give lasting happiness. I was not enjoying coding. I saw myself more of a business person. I could not go on with C/C++ anymore. I wanted to strategize, be part of the company’s decision making hierarchy and also get into a different industry.So, I paused, asked myself what I really enjoyed, what could be my fulfilling career and how I could get there. Taking a break was not easy. Especially when money was coming my way and when my parents expected me to settle down. But I took a risk. I went for my higher studies at IIM-C. There I met so many people who had left their settled jobs to do this MBA. All of us had a few things in common: All of us knew what we wanted our career to be in the mid to long run; all of us were willing to let go of short term gains for long term results; all of us had to balance this professional break with our personal responsibilities. Some of my batchmates had children, some were married and about to have babies, some were about to get married. The challenges which the spouses had to face to ensure their husbands/wives did this one year course were not trivial. I was so impressed by them, that on campus, I wrote my first book “My Beloved’s MBA Plans” about how does one take an unconventional professional route while balancing personal responsibilities. The book has stories of 16 couples whose love faced the test of times when their husbands/wives were suddenly out of jobs and studying.A lot of us took an initial salary cut after her IIM-C MBA to get into a job we loved. Today, we are all happy we took that stance. I can proudly say I enjoy my work and feel passionate about every contribution I make to the world through my work. I am able to make holistic decisions, do a lot of top management stakeholder alignment, present structured outputs, manage my time well and think long term. That is what the MBA gave me. That is what no engineering degree gives.If you want to grow as a software person, an MBA is not needed. But if you want to eventually get into the business aspects of technology, an MBA acts as a bridge.",0 followers,Sourabh Jhariya,4.6K,59,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-doing-an-MBA-after-a-BSc-helpful-in-getting-a-good-job

I completed my undergrad in“I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.” - Robert FrostBefore I start, let me give you a short summary of my professional background. I completed my undergrad inBack to when I was in collegeEven at this point, I’m not really thinking if I actually want to join an MBA program. My brain said “Everyone is doing it, so it must be good”, in short - I was just lazy or not thinking at all. Little did I realize only dead fish go with the flow and that I will go only as far as the crowd I am following will go. Nothing more, nothing less.After graduationWhile workingOnce IThe realizationI decided this was not the right time for me to pursue an MBA. I have absolutely zero experience in the corporate world to understand anything they will teach me in business school. I don’t even have any experiences to relate to. If I choose to pursue MBA at this time, it will be just another degree where I learnt a lot of things from the book and wrote exams for.So eventually I decided it is not wise to waste 4 years of undergraduate education which is highly technical to pursue another program for two years or so and move into a management field. I figured it is best for me to pursue a Masters in Engineering at the moment and if at a later stage, I feel a MBA degree will add value to my profile then I will consider going to a Business school. So it all comes down to what you want. But be open to listening to what people who have gone through both the paths have to say and then make an educated decision.",0 followers,Laxman Lokhande,631,116,11.5M,https://www.quora.com/Is-doing-an-MBA-after-a-BSc-helpful-in-getting-a-good-job

You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?I have got a lot of accusations, of being money minded, this and that in the PMs in Quora.This is an answer to everyone, an answer which would describe my thought process in taking this particular decision.Before, starting with that, let us understand the structure of the Government’s Bureaucracy. That will help us have more clarity, in understanding my decision.The Government is divided into Levels, according to the 7th Central Pay Commission. There are totally 18 levels, with 03 entry points.Level 01 - 05 - Lower Services - Peons, Constables, Stenos, Clerks etc.Level 06 - 09 - Middle Services - Inspectors, Section Officers, DSPs, Block Officers etc.Level 10 - 18 - Upper Services - IAS, IPS, IRS, Undersecretary etc.Now, I have always aspired for the upper civil services, usually conducted by the UPSC, which deals with the upper management of the Government.This is where most of the “thinking” is done, this is where policies are “ideated” and this is where public policies are “drafted”.An IAS joins at Level 09 during training, and then starts off from Level 10, and has the possibility of having more than 07 promotions in his career of 35 years.This is where I wanted to be, join the bureaucracy, and then rise high enough to shape the policy-making. (Usually around Level 13 or so)Now, I have been working with the MHA for the last two years, at Level 07.This is the middle management services.This is where the policies which are “drafted” by the top echelons are “implemented” on-ground.Working in rural Bihar for the last 02 years, I have understood the exact ground realities, of where exactly it is going wrong, and how the policy drafting needs a bit change, by someone who has actual on-ground realistic experiences.But, a Level 07 employee can grow upto max of Level 10 or 11, where you start competing with junior IAS officers when you are about to retire. (Example Promoted SP vs IPS SP)So, in a span of 35 years, I will get only 3–5 promotions, and that too will be still stuck in middle management, and never reach the “ideation” and “policy-drafting” stages.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” now? Which is where I really want to be.I am not able to clear the UPSC exam. I have tried.I am stuck in middle management, away from home, with an unstable life, mediocre salary, erratic transfers and postings, very few promotions and very slow career growth and strained personal relationships.If I get married to anyone soon, she would want to work in a city, which would again increase long distance and put more strain on the family.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” considering all these factors?The answer came here - Lateral Entry from the Corporate - Lateral entry: Over 6,000 private sector specialists apply for 10 joint secretary posts in government [ https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lateral-entry-over-6000-private-sector-specialists-apply-for-10-joint-secretary-posts-in-government/articleshow/65459546.cms ]And this privatization of the Government by bringing in external specialists is going to increase a lot in the next two decades or so.And they are getting Joint Secretary posts directly, which is a Level 15 post. A direct jump from Level 07 to Level 15, and if I stay I would retire by Level 10.I had to think.I had a plan.A long-term plan, with lots of risks and possibilities of failing.Get into the corporate sector.The lateral entry needs 15 years of total work-ex. I already have 05 years work-ex (Startup, Sabre and MHA)I need to work for 10 years, a decade in the corporate sector, after which I can make a shift to upper civil services - Level 15 in a very short time.And I have seen the 6000 applicants - Some are good, some are okay, not that stellar - I know my work ex in the Central Government in rural Bihar would stand out and would get a chance to interview for the Joint Secretary posts - This is 10 years later I am talking about - 2030 - When I am around 38 years old.So, how do I jump into the corporate sector?Some private job which deals with Public Policy or Development Consultancy or Social Impact or Public Administration jobs ?Also, I need a post-graduation, ensuring all the educational qualifications are in place.So, I made a list of colleges/schools/institutes which would ...","62,821 followers",Akand Sitra,2.9K,371,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-doing-an-MBA-after-a-BSc-helpful-in-getting-a-good-job

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but I also enjoy the finer things in life and I don’t like to rely on anyone else to get them.I punted. I applied to graduate school and thought about eventually getting a PhD in Art History. I had a 4.0 college GPA, two internships at highly venerated Los Angeles museums, great recommendations from my professors, as well as a published thesis paper. I was certain one of the master’s programs I applied to would accept me. Six grad school applications, several essays, a GRE and lots of waiting led me to being repeatedly rejected by EVERY. SINGLE. PROGRAM. with the exception of McGill university in Montreal who put me on a waiting list.FUCK.Who am I if I’m not some member of the academia, the girl who has bookshelves stacked with memoirs by Caillebotte and Cassat. Who am I if I can’t speak with authority while I tour Europe casually with friends:Internal monologue ensues:Enter, University of Portland Pamplin School of Business.I spoke to their program advisor, did some research, looked into Portland, applied to the school, got accepted because of my GRE score and gpa but needed to work on a lot of prerequisites in the summer term to catch up. I found an apartment, moved, bada bing bada boom.Two years later I became an associate at a top financial advisory firm. Now I’m a portfolio manager. If I went with getting a PhD in art history I would still be in school with no promise of employment after I graduate. I work 8–5 M-F and have full benefits (401k, vacation, sick time, insurance, paid medical leave etc.). I come home from work and my work is at the office, I don’t take anything home with me. I close my office door at 5pm and it’s “see ya tomorrow”. And the best part is, I actually really like my job. It’s fun and I’ve discovered new talents.Is my experience the experience of every MBA grad? No, certainly not. I had a lot of catching up and hard work to get there. I had family support and a full time job while doing school full time. I ate ramen noodles and hard boiled eggs for the better part of two years. I made significant relationships with advisors and professors. I asked the right questions.All in all my student loans amount to about $60,000. Pricey? Yeah, of course. But with my background I never would have obtained this type of job/salary without the MBA. So it was definitely worth it for me.You need to ask yourself, do you want to live to work or work to live?I prefer the latter.","2,730 followers",Victoria Zorzoli,1.2K,77,3.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-doing-an-MBA-after-a-BSc-helpful-in-getting-a-good-job

I would like to brief you more about each one.Academics:The academics part is further split into two parts. Your grade would be converted to german grade (out of 4, 1 being highest, 4 being lowest) and given points based on that out of 25. Rest 30 points are given based on your grades on mathematics and subjects relevant to the course you are applying for.Thus, CGPA and having good overall grades are very important.Letter of recommendation:TUM generally asks for two letters of recommendation. I would suggest taking them from two professors.The following points will help you to get a good recommendation letter.The letter of Motivation is given 20 points. Your achievements, projects, learnings, internships, etc are linked and reflected only through this. Make sure you cover the below points in the Letter of motivationWith these points, you understood that more weightage should be given to the motivation and reason part rather than highlighting each and every part which is already mentioned in your CV. Coming to CV, make sure it's either with a boxed format (As preferred by top B schools) or Europass formats.So, the first-round is evaluated for 100 points (based on the above points) and if you score more than 95 you will be selected directly and if you score less than 75, you will be rejected. If you score in between you will be selected for the second round.The second round consists of an interview of 20–30 minutes. Your motivation and basic questions from both mechanical and electrical engineering will be asked. Answering 70–80% of questions may yield higher chances to get an admission.Thus by doing the below you can boost your chances to get into TUM.I am always open to help.
