They have good enough money and business that they don't have to stay in USA to earn in dollars and maintain their good upper class.Some in another answer commented that, “It was quite a privilege to visit USA in the past but not now”You asked a question on laws and regulations, but I am more than sure that there is immense amount of information on immigration policies (about USA) on other site than anyone can advice you on Quora.I rather have another answer for you. I think you should focus and educate yourself on the issues of illegitimate migration.So, if you are planning to come on Tourist visa with intent of staying - you rather change your application to student visa. Please don't create another precedent of people coming in and staying.Since, USCIS cannot read all people's intent they will just deny tourist VISA application for most young people, rather most young people get their entry via F1 status. Its not the blame on USCIS but on the people who set this precedent of coming but not leavingSource:In the above figure you can see that, “it's easier to be approved for USA visa if you have been to other countries.”Please try to be a good apple, else even if you make it to USA and find a way of not returning you will most likely be working odd-jobs at odd hours at odd places. Well, this is just a prediction (most possible scenario) - but I cannot be sure how your life will really turn out (best, good, bad or worse). But, your actions will have consequences on the outcome of other applicants.","5,152 followers",Maya Morena,1K,392,4.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-the-Chinese-in-some-countries-still-use-traditional-Chinese-over-simplified-Chinese

While in US, I befriended an Indian guy working at counter of one of the stores. He filled me on the various tricks people use to get in US and stay. The top two wereNo wonder USCIS is strict in issuing visas .What are the laws or punishment for that offence in the US if one stays illegally?Deportation and blacklisting from future travel to US are the two that come to my mind immediately.What are the chances of getting caught staying illegal?If you are staying illegally by entering on a tourist visa, you will definitely not have an SSN or TIN. That is a crippling factor. You won’t get credit, you most probably won’t get insurance, you can’t get US driver’s license, you can’t rent in most of the places because you will fail credit check. Any interaction with a law officer might reveal your illegal presence because your only proof of identification would be the passport with expired visa. So there are high chances of getting caught unless someone is sheltering you.Will he get any job there staying illegally without any US documents except his Indian Passport or Indian education/work experience certificates?It is a known fact that a lot of places employ illegal immigrants and pay them cash because they are cheap. But these are mostly places where manual labor is required (farming, lawn maintenance, restaurants, etc.). I do not know what happens to the employer when they are caught employing illegal immigrants. My guess is they fake ignorance.Getting a white collar job is more difficult because companies do a better job of background check.I am in no way endorsing people who use the methods above to prolong their stay in US and my advice is don’t do anything illegal.",0 followers,Jeff Tipton,675,354,1.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-the-Chinese-in-some-countries-still-use-traditional-Chinese-over-simplified-Chinese

We were already a third world country known for having a high murder rate. It is estimated the Hurricane set us back another 50 years.I was in my mother's belly when my father left to learn English and try to raise some money in the US. My mother kept crying over him and when I was born decided to go help him. She left me with my grandparents who lived far away in a mountainous jungle area where they had a farm. I believed that they were my parents. My friends would talk about all the ""expensive"" presents I would get from mysterious relatives far away. I felt well to do, because I had pretty dresses.One day the a group of men came by our home at night and shot my grandmother. My grandfather hid me in a corner. We didn't try to get the police because there were rumors in our area that the police were known to steal or kill. So we just placed her on the adjoining bed after they left and went to bed. The next morning we went from house to house telling everyone of her passing and my grandfather started digging her grave. That day changed my life. My grandfather feeling depressed decided to sell the land and move in with another relative, he gave me to one of my aunt (she had a phone in her house). She called my dad to tell him what happened. My parents decided it wasn't safe for me there and made plans to hire a coyote to sneak me over. Unbeknownst to me. They probably thought I was too young and would go along with it.It started in the middle of the night. I woke to the motions of a car. My first thought was that I had been kidnapped. I looked up and saw my uncle so I went back to sleep. The next morning I woke up to a house I didn't recognize. I could sense my uncle had intentions of leaving, I begged him not to leave me and he promised me he wouldn't. But he lied. For the rest of journey I was surrounded, and dependent on strangers. They fed me and gave a place to stay and then I was passed to a different home. It felt like being in the underground railroad. I was passed from house to house and everyone was secretive. I realize now that not every house was a good place. And in some houses I was exploited. Some houses were part of the drug cartel and in one house the room adjacent to me was a brothel. I'm not sure when this part of the journey stopped but a transition was made. Where I met the group of people who were my coyote. From there we walked against desert like plains and sun and heat and plants that grabbed my legs and left scratches. I realize now that I was around the grand canyon area but I didn't get a nice view - just flatness.One night we were walking and the area was still a plain but there were trees and a clearing. It was so strange and cool. The air was crisp and we ran behind this big boulder. A man in the room started talking but I didn't pay attention. I was looking at a beautiful light up ahead. It was huge, in the shape of circle and kept moving around. It was held up by a material I didn't recognize. I didn't know then that that light is designed to spotlight intruders. And then....we were caught.The officers were really nice and one of them spoke Spanish. They asked me who the people were that I was with. And then I remembered that the man in the group had grabbed me when we were behind the rock and told me that if we did get caught I had to say that they were my parents. I was taught that lying was a sin so I told the truth. They were thrown in prison and I was sent to an orphanage where they keep children who cross the border. One day I got a mysterious call from a man who claimed to be my father. I didn't believe him so I asked for proof. He asked if there was anything I wanted he would buy it for me. I was overjoyed and listed all the animals I used to have on my farm. I wanted my farm and home back. Especially my horse, dogs, and pigs.One day as the kids and I were playing tag this man was at the doorway and spotted me. His face lit up and he got down on his knees and opened his arms. Who is this man I thought as I walked toward his arms awkwardly. It wasn't until he opened his bag to reveal a pig, horse and dog that I gasped. It was my dad. I was so happy to see him and at the same time I was disappointed. My first impression of my dad was that he was an idiot. Did he not realize that I wanted REAL animals? I looked at these animals that were miniature, squishy and had small ball like material in them. And felt the biggest wave of disappointment and I realized we came from two very different world. After that I took a plane for the first time to Long Island. We had to go to court to decide my fate. By the way crossing the border is a misdemeanor (not a felony) so by all I am not a criminal. People say that I can just go back, return, and do it legally and the truth is I can't. What's done is done. If I leave I can't come back. Crossing the border a second time IS a felony and will not be tolerated by the government. That being said my parents tried to plead to let me stay trying to say that I came due to the hurricane. The USCIS double checks everything and they determined my parents were lying since I came a year too late for the program my parents were trying to put me in. In the end the judge ruled that since I was a minor and had no one to care for me I would be allowed to stay. But I was granted no status. I was an alien.Flash forward to my senior year. I was a top student and had been accepted into Mount Holyoke (an all girl Ivy League school ) Too bad I couldn't go. I didn't qualify for financial aid even though my family was poor and we were going bankrupt. Financial aid requires legal status, so do most scholarships. In fact when I did a search of scholarships I could only find about 15 I was able to apply for. Not having legal status really narrowed down my options. I managed to win two 1k dollar scholarships but seeing as the tuition was 42 grand a year it wouldn't even make a dent. I found out I couldn't get government loans and grants. Since I didn't have legal status I also couldn't drive or work. I felt like everything I worked for was falling apart. There is a bit of good news, that same year 2012 Obama passed a Deferred Action (DACA). I qualified but it's all temporary. In fact right now I'm not working because I had to get my temporary permission renewed. I've been two months now for it to come and still nothing. My aunt just got her permission. As you can imagine something this temporary is really bad for employment, most don't want to hire someone who is only allowed to work for a certain amount of time. This however grants me NO LEGAL STATUS AT ALL. It does however ""put me on the grid"" so to speak. They know where I live now and have my fingerprints on record. What I have is an ""alien number"". Interesting right? In the back of my license I am referred to as a ""temporary visitor"" So again, no legal status. :/ Also I should mention the dream act that was passed in my state of New York. The dream act that was passed allows immigrants who live in the state to use in - state tuition (before we had to pay out of state). The entire dream act was not passed so we still don't qualify for financial aid although some states allow this, but the immigrant needs to have gone to high school in that state, and have lived there a certain amount of time. (california is an example of a state that does this). So this is the life an immigrant a lot buts, and nos.I tried applying for the military in the hopes I could get into the MAVNI program. Nope. This month the GOP strongly voted against having us being allowed to join the military. So I can't do that anymore. Because apparently even that was too much.The most annoying thing about being an undocumented immigrant is the amount of ignorance on the subject. A lot of people confuse ""illegal"" with ""legal"" which are two totally different things. A legal immigrant CAN get married to citizen and become a citizen, they can also apply for an Adjustment of Status. I can't do any of these things. When I was 18 my family and I went to multiple lawyers and I told the same thing. THERE IS NO WAY FOR AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TO BECOME A CITIZEN. THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A PATH YET. It's really annoying when the majority of people think ""immigrants have it easy"". We don't. We have to pay taxes and we not allowed to receive any benefits from the taxes we pay. In other words we don't qualify for food stamps, welfare, social security benefits, and retirement. We don't get any of these even though we have to pay for them. People believe that I can just get married to a citizen....NO. They also believe that I can just go back and come back legally. NO. If someone were to leave the US after coming illegal there is a 10 year bar. and if they attempt to reenter it becomes a felony. There's no way to come back after you crossed the border. It's just too hard.Theses were my options from my immigration lawyers gave me:I just can't win.Every single visa has a list of requirements and I would have to prove every single thing. I got deferred action and while this grants me no legal status I had to prove a lot of things just to get it. I had to prove that I came here at a young age and I couldn't be above a certain age. I had to prove that I attended high school and graduated. I had to prove that I never left the US since arriving. I had to prove that I was of ""good character"". I have to continue studying because it is one of the requirements. Every single thing that immigrants have to apply for requires paperwork, money, and time. It's not easy, and for me right now it's impossible for me to get anything more.The diagram below probably explains it best* Good News!

But when he stepped out of the van the first thing I thought was oh my God I’ve got the biggest redneck in the world here.I introduce myself, we shake hands and he asked me what the problem is. While we were talking, a very young Mexican boy got out of the other side of the van and came around and stood next to Bubba. He never said anything, Bubba never introduced him or said anything to him, so I didn't pay any attention to him. I kept telling Bubba what the problem with my water was. After a few moments Bubba said okay, got it, the first thing I need to do is get a couple of samples of water directly from your wellhead. Where is your well? I tell him I'll take you to the well, and he turns to the Mexican boy and says something very slowly in English. The Mexican boy looks slightly confused and Bubba repeats it, there are some hand motions and other pointing and finally the young boy goes around to the back of the van to retrieve a couple of empty gallon containers, a wrench, and some other tools.While he's rooting around in the back of the van I asked Bubba, doesn't he speak English? Bubba kind of stared at me for a second and then said we do well enough with his smattering of English and my smattering of Spanish. I then asked something that I probably normally wouldn't have but it just slipped out, I said why did you hire him then?Bubba stared hard at me for a good long 4 or 5 seconds before he responded. Finally he sighed and said you asked so I'm going to tell you. He said I don't know what your politics are, and I don't really care. But I hired him because he's an excellent worker. I told him that as a condition of his employment he would have to take his ESL lessons. But he's newly married, and he and his wife have a new baby, and she's all alone with the baby all day long in the trailer. So in the evening he wants to go home to be with her and their new son. Bubba said I understand that, so I'm cutting him a lot of slack on his ESL lessons.Bubba went on to say that he was getting up in years and his health wasn't doing very well and he was looking to try to find somebody to turn the business over to. He said that he had run through several years worth of young white and black men. Then he stared at me hard again and said I will never ever have a white American boy or black American boy working for me. I hadn't made much of a reaction to what he said, but I asked him why? He said because they're lazy, they do sloppy work, they bitch and gripe about the work, they bitch about not being paid enough, they show up late, or they don't show up at all. They are openly insolent and disobey me. He said the black kids will steal you blind. He said the white kids won't but otherwise they're both just the same - undependable and lousy workers.He said on the other hand the Mexicans that have worked for me, show up on time, they do exactly what they're told, they do it the right way, if they don't know how to do it they ask and listen to what I tell them. They ask for more work. They don't steal from me. They are extremely family-oriented and take care of their families. That's why I let this young boy go home to his young wife and son in the evening instead of taking his ESL classes.I didn't expect this kind of explanation from a redneck Bubba in the Deep South. I was a combination of surprised, pleased, and a bit ashamed. I told him I said you can hire whoever you want. I said it sounds to me like you hired exactly who I would hire if I was in your situation.By then the Mexican boy had returned from the back of the van with all the tools, and we took off for the well. I noticed that the Mexican boy did all the work, while Bubba told him what to do. I eventually signed an agreement with Bubba to go ahead and redo my well and plumbing to fix the problems I was having.I have no idea whether or not this Mexican boy was illegal. I didn't care then, and I don't care now. I'm pretty sure that Bubba didn't care either, although that surprised me at the time. There's a beer commercial on TV that has a tagline something like, it doesn't matter where you come from it matters what you do. When it comes to immigration, too many Americans don't understand that.Updated to say that I probably didn't answer the question. But I'll answer it this way. If somebody does the job they're supposed to do, the way they're supposed to do it, and they do it well and they do it honestly, then I don't care where they are from. If that doesn't answer your question I don't know what will.",15 followers,Charles Vanderford,2.7K,16.8K,17.5M,https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-gone-to-US-on-a-holiday-or-visit-long-enough-to-earn-their-Green-Card-not-returned-to-India-What-would-happen-if-one-does-that-What-are-the-laws-or-punishments-for-that-offense-in-the-US-if-one-stays-illegally

But if you will read to the end, you will see how it is that Latino labor is so treasured in this country, even if the workers are undocumented.I operated a landscape business for 20 years. I had a lot of Hispanic workers in that time. But my business attorney guided me through the process so as not to trample the rights of any Hispanic that was perfectly legal to work in the U.S.I’m not familiar with E-verfy. For me at that time, I was required to submit the proper tax forms (W2s, I9s etc) and Social Security information just like I would with any worker. If the worker was undocumented, his/her paperwork would be bogus. In about three to four months, I would get a letter from the Social Security Administration explaining that my employee’s SS number did not match any of their numbers on file. We called this a “No-Match” letter. I was then to verify the employee’s SS number and resubmit the information back to the SS Administration. It usually took another several months for another No-Match letter to come in the mail. When it did, it was time to have a conversation with the worker. In the meantime, the SS Administration continued to accept the worker’s SS payments. I always wondered where this money went if there was no number for the worker. That’s a mystery. Back in the early 1990s, the SS Administration would simply legitimize the bogus number and assign the funds to that worker. This basically made the guy legal. Times have certainly changed since then.Some things to keep in mind. As an employer, I was not allowed to question an applicant about his/her legal status unless I question ALL job applicants. I was not allowed to assume any worker was undocumented. This meant that I was not allowed to simply walk over to Juan Miguel and ask if he was legally allowed to work in the U.S. If I did this, I would be guilty of racial profiling and I would set myself up for a potential lawsuit.Many of my customers did not understand this concept. I also used to have other landscapers cross the street from their own customers’ properties to come over and try to find out if my people were legal. Even though it was absolutely NONE OF THEIR CONCERN, it seemed they felt that my having Hispanic workers meant I was taking unfair advantage of their willingness to work cheap so that my prices could be lower giving me a competitive edge. But those people had no right whatsoever to question me or my people. There were times when another landscaper would get in my face so violently that the police needed to be called. Interestingly, a lesson could be taken from the police. The cops never ever questioned my people about their legal status. It wasn’t their job to do so and they did NOT want to be accused of racial profiling any more than I wanted it.Also, here are some other facts of which the general population is not aware:I need to explain that I am NOT down on American workers. But here in the U.S. all the good American employees are either in school, college or in their careers. The American worker, in general is a very very good worker. But s/he is also very educated and on a path that keeps her/him away from the brutal, hot, sweltering work that my landscape business demanded of workers. Thus, the only American workers that were available for my type of work were basically the dregs of American society - the stoners, the laziest of the lazy, the ones that could not pass a piss test, could not work sober because as soon as the buzz went away, they found something to drink until the buzz came back and the most dishonest. There are many thousands of industries in the nation that need workers that are willing to get hot, sweaty and dirty and work very long hours. If these companies are to stay in business at all, they need to hire workers that will actually do the work. For many of these companies, it actually becomes far easier to pay illegal workers in cash under the table than it is to continually put up with the needless drama and nonsense of the curs of American society. It is far easier to “launder” cash wages through petty expenses than it is to put up with the constant crap of the American worker.I sure am glad that this is all behind me now.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,970,45.5K,294.5M,https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-gone-to-US-on-a-holiday-or-visit-long-enough-to-earn-their-Green-Card-not-returned-to-India-What-would-happen-if-one-does-that-What-are-the-laws-or-punishments-for-that-offense-in-the-US-if-one-stays-illegally
