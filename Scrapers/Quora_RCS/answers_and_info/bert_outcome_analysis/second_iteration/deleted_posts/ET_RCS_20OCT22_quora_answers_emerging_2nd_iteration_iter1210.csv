You look at him, he's wearing branded clothing like Hugo Boss or Prada, you remember he drove around the campus in his new Ferrari his parents bought for him. He came over and asked you with his semi broken English: I want to know American politics, like your election and stuff.You felt that he has good intentions so sure, let's talk about politics.The first thing he asked is: aren't you ashamed of yourself, taking land from Native Americans and killing them off? How do you sleep at night?You were a bit taken back, Native Americans? You're not responsible for things happened 300 years ago. You tried to explain the colonial era, and the relationship between colonists, Indians and French... Before you got into the 7 year war, the kid asked again:What do you think about your gun control? Why are your white cops killing black people and no one seems to care?You had to switch gears in your mind and told him gun control and racism in law enforcement is two different issues, and the tension between white cop and black community is a complicated social, economic issue with historical reasons factored in. And before you could start talking about Ferguson, he cut you off and asked: what do you think about your drone attacks that killing innocent people overseas?You said, they're not innocent people, they're terrorists.He rolled his eyes and said: nah... they're like freedom fighters, you're just brain washed by your government. I saw the pictures, you know. You guys are big bully and have your fleet around the world, have military bases in other countries, and you interfere with our Taiwan issue! It's none of your damn business.And do you know your Texas school teach creationism in science class? Now that's just stupid! We all know the world wasn't created in 6 days... are you guys stupid?Oh and, I heard there's this crazy person gunned down bunch of school kids in... what's the name of that city... can't remember... Anyway, why does your government allow citizen to own guns? Don't you care about the safety of your kids? Why don't you do things like us in China? We ban guns. Simple, problem solved.Oh and, what is your deal with abortion? Isn't it women's right? You call yourself a human rights nation? Really?Oh and, what do you think about the culture genocide happening in Hawaii right now? Don't you know people in Hawaii had been fighting for their independence ever since the 50s? Why do you even want Hawaii? They're different people speaking a different language and having a different religion... They're never yours to begin with. Why do you occupy Hawaii by force and commit culture genocide on that peaceful island?Oh and, why do you people eat smelly cheese? I heard you guys eat cheese with maggots, that's just totally gross!At this point, you realize, he doesn't want to know US politics. He's just want to tell you what he thinks about US politics.Repeat this conversation 1000 times, and you know why overseas Chinese are generally reluctant to discuss Chinese politics with Americans. Most people who come to me and ask about Chinese politics don't want to have a conversation about Chinese politics (by conversation I mean he says something I say something). They mostly just want to tell me what they think about Chinese politics, and I, as a Chinese person, need to confirm their ignorance or I'm brain washed by my evil government. In fact, very few of them know the basics to even conduct a constructive conversation on this issue. How do you have a constructive conversation with someone who doesn't even understand the Electoral College system about presidential election? How do I explain the Chinese political system to someone who doesn't understand the concept of politburo?But in the end, it's the attitude that turns me off from this topic, it's that entitled self-righteous arrogance, that smirk on their face, that ignorance of asking a starving person why can't he have a steak dinner, that really annoys me. They don't want to know about China, they want to tell me they know more about China, the ""real China"", than me, a Chinese person who was born and brought up in that country. They want to tell me everything I know is a lie, I was brainwashed and they have come to enlighten me, the ignorant savage.Well, to this I say, piss off.",3 followers,Feifei Wang,4.9K,9.2K,113M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-overseas-Chinese-students-so-reluctant-to-discuss-their-countrys-political-system
1,"It’s not about reluctance but incompatibility between the systems.The Chinese political system has a different system, worldview, terminologies than other systems. So it’s very awkward and difficult to use the Greco-Roman and Abrahamic systems and terms to argue about what’s happening in China.Using the “harmony” as an example, the first time I heard about this term was from Hu Jintao’s “It’s not about reluctance but incompatibility between the systems.The Chinese political system has a different system, worldview, terminologies than other systems. So it’s very awkward and difficult to use the Greco-Roman and Abrahamic systems and terms to argue about what’s happening in China.Using the “harmony” as an example, the first time I heard about this term was from Hu Jintao’s “Then I went back to actually check Confucianism on its religious policy as well as social policies and models, such as “To sum, you can’t talk about it given only 30 minutes without being either super shallow or totally biased. This is not just for non-Chinese but also Chinese, who fail to see the thing from the angle of civilization’s progression but are trapped in either classic Confucianism’s inevitable dynasty replacement and bureaucrats’ own excellency to pull the table, or Marxism’s 19th century euro-centric mechanical materialistic narrative that divides the ancient history from the modern history, or a totally westernized “democralogy” empowered by “neoliberalogy”.In short, it’s easy to scream out loudly that “communism will take over the world”, “Jesus has given his life to you so your son should call him father instead of you”, or “the free world will triumph”, but it’s difficult to talk about what’s really going on given that the ideological boundary has been so strong nowadays, particularly in the Western world as I see it and observe it by myself.So if you really wanna talk about it, then you have to do better than just repeating to me or the Chinese overseas students for everything they have already learned from Western political science. Otherwise, it’s just that both sides are throwing the talking points at each other’s face.In that regard, I find it’s easier to talk with someone who is from a third world country (non-Eastern European) so that we can talk about the resource, and the idea, software, hardware attached to it in order to organize, manage and reconstruct the resource for a better gain for everyone in the country and on earth. The conversation is usually constructive focusing on materialism, dialecticism, pragmaticism, the thing that actually exists rather than ideological and metaphysical talking points (democracy, liberty, identity politics, rule of law, free market, human rights…), and the implications usually work for both sides. But if it’s that’s not the case, then I will prefer to shut up to maintain the “harmony”. I guess that’s also what many Chinese students have thought about.",138 followers,Xiaoli Shen,743,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-overseas-Chinese-students-so-reluctant-to-discuss-their-countrys-political-system
2,"The (mainland) Chinese students I've met, in Hong Kong, Manila, Los Angeles and Boston, as well as those who I've met in China itself are not at all reluctant to discuss the Chinese political system; at least no more so than those from any other country, discussing their political system.Many of those Chinese students have been associated with the political system, as their parents or family members are government workers, teachers, or officials and party members; the Chinese students I've met have overwhelmingly been children of privilege.  Again, that's not unusual for foreign students.MaThe (mainland) Chinese students I've met, in Hong Kong, Manila, Los Angeles and Boston, as well as those who I've met in China itself are not at all reluctant to discuss the Chinese political system; at least no more so than those from any other country, discussing their political system.Many of those Chinese students have been associated with the political system, as their parents or family members are government workers, teachers, or officials and party members; the Chinese students I've met have overwhelmingly been children of privilege.  Again, that's not unusual for foreign students.Many are also not particularly knowledgeable about the political system, as they are young and relatively inexperienced in local and national politics, or comparative political systems.   The overseas Chinese students I've met fall into two broad categories: those who have traveled extensively in the world and those who are abroad for the very first time, and have never before experienced another country's culture or rules of law, or have thought much about day-to-day government influence in their lives.  Several, if not most, of the Chinese students I've met have educations that are largely funded through programs of the Chinese government; no matter how things might appear, it's not that easy to get a visa and study abroad - it's expensive and needs all sorts of approvals. Again, that's true for students studying abroad from anywhere.Most of the Chinese students that I've met don't know much about those events that have made for headlines in other parts of the world (like Tianamen Square, or the Umbrella Revolution); or refrain from expressing an opinion on it because they don't have a lot of information and haven't considered the news in a thoughtful way. Not everyone responds emotionally and immediately to information that probably has very limited immediate impact on them.With 1.2 billion people, many in China don't always pay attention to executions happening in the north, or to terrorist attacks and people blowing themselves up on busses in Shanghai; just as we in the US don't always hear about executions in Texas or every workplace shooting or standoff.  In China, coverage of national events can vary dramatically between provinces, just as it does, in the West.It's highly unlikely that most of the Chinese students that you will meet overseas will be well-versed in discussions about political power struggles and corruption in China (What I found was that some of the Chinese I spoke with didn't understand the notion that there was a great deal of disagreement and discussion amongst US citizens with respect to foreign and domestic policy; that that was somehow either disloyal or a wasted effort - and that we can respect our leaders but disagree with some of their philosophies.  Politics in China seems to be both more simple and more complex, in terms of the average citizens relationship to government.  One of the business leaders I spoke with at a dinner in China who had studied abroad, said to me ""I don't understand how people there struggle to get to retirement and old age and have no money and nothing; how people are left on their own. It's wrong to treat your people like that. In China, you get a pension and a kinder retirement.""  That was news to me. But I thought of the 300 million+ people in China's rural population who live on the equivalent of $2 a day or less   - and don't understand how what he was saying worked with what I believed to be true from statistics Id seen - and I also thought of the hundreds of millions who have risen out of that kind of poverty in the last few decades because of China's growth.   And I thought of the US's flawed and imperfect, but still functioning, social security system and medicare system.   I still don't know what happens to people in China in old age; it may differ from province to province, between districts, or even villages and cities; but his comment reminded me that such discussions are bounded by personal experience. When we talk about each other's governments and political system, what we're really trying to talk about and figure out are the differences we imagine in our underlying values. As best as I can tell, both he and I care a lot about older people in our countries and respect them a great deal; our governments and political systems perceive their roles and responsibilities in this area and administer and respond to those needs and concerns, very differently, and with varying degrees of effectiveness, or so it would seem.He said to me: ""We like the American people, we just don't like the American government""  I said, ""yeah, well, thank you, I guess.  But you know- the American government IS the American people.  We are imperfect, and but this is who we are.""  He was a little taken aback when I said that.  I'm not sure he'd ever considered himself responsible for his government in the same way that I consider myself responsible for mine.  I vote and have actively participated and negotiated the making of laws and regulation, as both a citizen and from time to time through my work; in China, the process of participation in government is different, although the effects of people's participation may be very similar, and our personal satisfaction with the process might be similar, too.Perhaps those Chinese students would rather talk about other things that they are more familiar with and eager to share, like music, or sports, or other things that they might feel they know more about, and that are less veiled in complex and muddy attitudes.  Most people would prefer to talk about similarities than differences.Maybe your best option if you want to ask overseas Chinese students about their understanding of their political system, is to ask about their personal experiences; how they got to the US or the West, what they think about voting or if they would care and if they think it makes a difference, if they have had experiences with the DMV (the Department of Motor Vehicles) that compare to what they might go through if they wanted to drive a car in their home in China, or how their police and security forces work.  Ask them about their public transportation systems; about their public holidays; about how difficult it might be to lend or borrow money, what kind of healthcare they have.  Ask them about what kinds of work they hope to do and how hard they think it might be to find a job when they return.  Ask them about their friends and family and what they do for a living, and what part of China they're from, and what they miss about their home town.  Ask them about what their favorite movie or TV show was growing up; what their favorite sport was or is; if there's any Western entertainment that they like or Chinese entertainment that they particularly miss or think you might enjoy.It's funny what you can learn by asking the simplest of questions: One woman told me she learned and practiced much of her excellent English by watching ""Desperate Housewives"" - I disappointed her by telling her Wisteria Lane was not at all representative of American suburban lifestyles and behavior; that it was satire. Her English was excellent; but she didn't comprehend the idea of satire. It was no wonder she was a little bit wary of me, as her experience with blonde middle-aged American women was that they were...well, like THAT.That should provide you with a great deal of insight into their experience and attitudes, including those towards and about their political system. Remember also to be sure to think about your own answers to those questions with respect to your experience in your home country, and how you might answer the same questions if posed to you.  It's a lot more difficult to be on the receiving end of those kinds of questions than you might imagine.Finally, and most importantly, hasn't anyone ever told you that it's considered rude to talk about sex, religion, or politics at the dinner table, or with people you've just met?  Get to know someone a little bit before you go ""there""; that might help you to understand why people -in general, not just Chinese students - might be reluctant to discuss such personal issues,  especially before a baseline of communication and mutual respect has been established between you.",0 followers,Shun,997,584,17.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-overseas-Chinese-students-so-reluctant-to-discuss-their-countrys-political-system

Under such circumstances I don't think they are always in the mood to discuss politics in their faraway home country.TL;DR: Chinese students are not paid by China government to do propaganda, nor are they obliged to satisfy some foreigners' curiosity, who are interested just in their ethnicity and don't care for them as individuals.

In general, I find students whose parents are small-to-middle business owners (those with little political connections) and professionals more tolerant towards different point of political views after several years of foreign exposure. Small business owners face risks of expropriation by various levels of governments all the time. The professionals (physicians, attorneys, professors, and etc.) have little say in relevant public issues. For those whose parents are senior Communist Party cadres, it does require a leap of faith for them to be critical of the regime.Another major cause is the Chinese education system; it successfully ""brainwashes"" students' minds in a way pretty different from most of foreigners might imagine. The curriculum of politics in Chinese primary, secondary, and higher education isThose nonsenses have following implications. First, the education is successful in brainwashing because most of students become cynical and apathetic to politics, even though politics is, by definition, a public matter (by politics, I do mean substantive and serious issues, not trivia and gossips that a stereotypical cab driver in Beijing would like to talk about). As most of them come from better-off families, and have not experienced any major economic downturn in their whole lives (and socially inexperienced), they largely feel that ""politics has nothing to do with my life,"" or ""all political systems are evil, they are no different in terms of outcome."" Meanwhile, their more worldly parents (who had experience of poverty and numerous political movements and violence) normally tell them to be away from politics.That's why you often find following typical ""Second, again asFinally, thanks to the education and partially-free-at-most media in China, most Chinese students can hardly distinguish the CCP regime from their national identities. Any criticism towards the regime might be regarded as offensive. It is pretty hard to imagine in a polity with contested election. For instance, my non-Turkish friends and I often talks about Turkish politics with my Turkish friends; none of them find it offensive when we bring about stuff such as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's ridiculous behaviors and the AKP.I guess those are the reasons why we observe the symptom that Chinese students don't feel comfortable talking about Chinese politics. A more constructive way of having conversation with Chinese students might be talking about universal and everyday-relevant issues, such as easiness of doing business, governance of local communities, pension/retirement reform, and etc.","66,549 followers",Dima Vorobiev,1.1K,4.2K,138.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-overseas-Chinese-students-so-reluctant-to-discuss-their-countrys-political-system

Typically we work with a Markov assumption on the state and assume that the transitions are stationary. But what if that was not the case? Would most data scientists know how to make a model with a custom probabilistic architecture understand enough computer science to build the underlying data structures and then learn from the data how to estimate the parameters? My guess is no. If the business question was a causal question that was to be inferred from an observational data set would a data scientist know how to estimate causal effect from associational effect? You would probably build a suitable causal graphical model and then use the do-calculus developed by Pearl to isolate the causation effects while blocking the confounders.If you had the ability to run an experiment instead of looking at observed data how would you randomise the experiment to ensure exchangeability? This would also give you causal effect directly from the associational effect in the experiment, something which is not possible with observed data.Learning how to truly model real world problems takes a lot of time and effort and a lot of understanding of relevant theory. I mean being able to take a problem and built the appropriate model not fit it into one of these boxes that are designed to sell a product! Namely that anyone can be a data scientist.So spending a large amount of time on learning how to do modelling properly will never be a waste of time!
