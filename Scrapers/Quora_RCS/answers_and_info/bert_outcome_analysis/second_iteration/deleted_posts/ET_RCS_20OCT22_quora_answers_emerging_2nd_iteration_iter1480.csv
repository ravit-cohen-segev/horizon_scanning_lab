Both of these roles are nascent and evolving by time. About 6-7 years back , sales team used to collect requirements , so there was no separate need of Business Analyst, and there was comparatively very less amount of data to be analyzed compared to today's scenario, so there was no need of separate Analytics team to analyze data and get meaningful information out of it.Presently there is demand for both of these roles, so if you want to decide which role to go, just imagine your day having 2-9 meetings a day, with clients, managers, technical team, etc, did you like that, then you are for Business Analyst role. Now Imagine yourself working with numbers , advanced excel, analytics tool, 8-10 hours a day, did you like that, then Business Analytics is suitable field for you.","135,269 followers",Hector Quintanilla,2.5K,1.2K,88.3M,https://www.quora.com/I-graduate-with-an-economics-degree-in-one-semester-What-things-should-I-do-now-to-enter-the-field-of-business-analysis

The economics degree is really geared to the public sector in the classical sense. Economics grew out of the need to understand the public policy and how it affected the public good. It then branched out into labor economics, financial economics, and many other branches, but the core of economics is for the public sector, plain and simple.

These versions of history are usually pushed onto schools by outside parties for political reasons.Parents aren’t saying, “don’t tell that part of history.” They’re saying, “if you’re going to teach history, teach all of it, not just the parts that support your worldview.”Some outside groups want to teach “Part A” of history, and go straight to “Conclusion Z.” “Conclusion Z” is usually some form of “major systemic changes are needed now.” They’re intentionally leaving out Parts B-Y, because those would lead to a different conclusion.When it comes to critical thinking skills, there has, in fact, been a division in how these are taught to students. That division is due to the pressure schools are under to reach certain averages on standardized test scores, push students through to graduation, ignore discipline issues because of “restorative justice,” and generally lower all standards across the board. Critical thinking skills are taught to students who are already doing well on standardized tests and will have no problem graduating high school. Students who do struggle on tests and are in danger of failing will find less class time devoted to critical thinking skills, and more time devoted to more basic skills that will show up on standardized tests.The students who read and write at grade level or higher, and are generally well behaved, get to sit in book circles and discuss the novels they’re reading. They get to develop critical thinking skills that way.The students who are well behind grade level, or who cannot sit still and listen for any length of time, are more likely to be given short stories to read and worksheets to fill out based on those stories, with little whole group discussion involved.The students who can do grade-level work and can control themselves, but who have classmates who cannot, get the worst of it. They have to sit there, bored, with work that’s too easy for them, while their teacher struggles to control a handful of their classmates. That boredom eventually manifests itself in behavior problems too, which just leads to a downward spiral in the classroom.The solution to all of that is to do the exact opposite of what most public schools are doing these days. It’s to raise the bar for acceptable behaviors, be quicker to remove disruptive students, track students based on ability level, and accept that not all students are cut out for the regular classroom setting.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,605,9.8K,291.8M,https://www.quora.com/I-graduate-with-an-economics-degree-in-one-semester-What-things-should-I-do-now-to-enter-the-field-of-business-analysis

Then too, there are specific types of critical thinking that are characteristic of different subject matter: That's what we mean when we refer to ""thinking like a scientist"" or ""thinking like a historian.""Since the ability to think critically is a primary goal of education, it’s no surprise that people have tried to develop programs that could directly teach students to think critically without immersing them in any particular academic content. But the evidence shows that such programs primarily improve students’ thinking with the sort of problems they practiced in the program—not with other types of problems.

First of all, they are sometimes not taught well in schools. It takes time to develop these skills in students and enough time is something that most teachers do not have because of large classes, strict scheduling, and academic deadlines. Secondly, some people do not relate what they learn in an academic setting to real life applications, they simply leave it behind in the classroom. Thirdly, stimulation overload numbs the brain; today, under constant barrage from the output of our personal devices, people have learned not to spend too much time thinking about anything in particular, which would exercise critical thinking skills, but find their mental processes dominated by repetitive limited attention to many different things. Fourthly, social trends and pressures direct people away from critical thinking - it’s easier and more popular to trash something than it is to reason about it. The rise of internet trolls and the language of prominent modern politicians clearly demonstrate this. And fifth, a culture driven by the importance of self over all else negates attempts to introduce critical thinking - if I believe I’m right about something then the belief that my opinion is just as good as yours means that whatever argument you present, I’m not listening to you, even if I haven’t done any work to substantiate my opinion. All of these things have led to an absence of critical thinking in every day life, and even to a belief by some that it is not an essential skill set; commercials tell me what to wear, my friends tell me the best places to go, Facebook and instagram tell me what to think, and if I think I don’t like something I can just reject it without trying to understand it. I think that critical thinkers tend to be marginalized by much of the population because their language, search for insight, and attention to detail make them outsiders in modern popular culture.","27,079 followers",Allen Lobo,1.6K,601,25.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-Chinese-students-think-when-they-go-abroad-and-are-confronted-by-information-on-the-Internet-or-in-their-university-courses-that-was-censored-or-suppressed-by-their-government

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.The key point, however, is this:EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.Nobody is born solving complex problems. Like any skill, problem-solving is developed.Just keep doing it and you WILL get there.

But, would I be as skilled as I am now? F*ck no!The brain is indeed plastic, but not THAT plastic. It takes time to earn knowledge and to build it gradually. So the best hack to study is to break it bit by bit, every day.Studying is the same thing as eating a meal: you split the food in your plate into tiny bits and chew one at a time. If you chew many bits, you may end up choking.","129,108 followers",Jessica Su,3.9K,1.5K,49.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-important-managerial-skills-an-MBA-student-can-acquire-studying-in-B-schools

Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a bicep curl like movement to lift something?The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and stamina so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life.Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns.By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape would do (That, in a nutshell, is my answer to this question.I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not compliant robots.","246,664 followers",Dushka Zapata,2K,8.5K,231.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-important-managerial-skills-an-MBA-student-can-acquire-studying-in-B-schools

I was working my shift in the airline lounge.Warren, my boss, approached me as I was checking flights.“Hey, Matt. I got a favor to ask. It’s supposed to sleet all night. I’m concerned the morning team won’t make it in tomorrow. If I put you up in a hotel, is there any chance you’d open up the club tomorrow?”I didn’t think twice.“Sure, no problem.”Warren busted his ass to make sure we had everything we needed. Occasionally there would be overlapping vacation requests. He’d work like hell to get the shift covered. It wasn’t unusual for him to cover that shift himself.“Thanks, Matt. This is really helping me out.”I replied, “Don’t worry about the hotel. I’ll just grab an overnight kit and sleep on the luggage rack.”“Seriously? Hey, if that’s what you want.”So I slept on the luggage rack.The next morning I opened the club. Warren walked in the door at 10 a.m.“Don’t worry about coming in tonight. Go have a Merry Christmas, Matt.”He sent me home.Here’s how awesome Warren was:* He paid me while I was asleep.Pretty damn cool, right.What made Warren an awesome leader?He was the kind of boss I wanted to work hard for.That’s leadership.Here’s how I think he did it.1.
