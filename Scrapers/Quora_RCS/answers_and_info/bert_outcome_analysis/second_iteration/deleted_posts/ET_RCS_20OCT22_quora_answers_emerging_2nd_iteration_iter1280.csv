Korean men are just as stupid as any other men and so we don’t spend money on things that makes us better human beings.So how on God’s green earth did this contradictory product help launch aWhy South Korea's men are buying tons of cosmeticsLet me give you my two cents by explaining how a cosmetics company solved the two issues in a brilliant way.The story start in 2010 with a company called Innisfree that launched the following product. Its camouflage creme with sunblock.All able bodied Korean men must serve in the military for about 2 years. Anyone who’s ever had to put on military grade camo creme will testify that it’sBut what if it’s just for training?Countless Korean men hate this stuff because it’s so difficult to wash off after training. It certainly doesn’t help that the sun bakes our skin during the day and so it’s really quite agonizing cometh night time.Innisfree recognized this need and made good camo creme that looked exactly the same but was easier to wash off with special soap. It also doubled as a sun block.So now we arrive at the second issue. Men are stupid and wouldn’t buy this stuff even though it makes perfect sense to do so. So how did Innisfree overcome this barrier? They didn’t have to.There is a long standing tradition of throwing a party for our male youngsters before they enter bootcamp. What follows is usually a set of gifts given by loved ones such as letters or practical items such as strong wrist watches.This product was very strategically important for the same reason Apple/Microsoft/Google want to get their operating systems into the hands of students even at an economic loss. The reason being that those kids will grow accustomed to their products andApplying this type of makeup is one of the first kinds that kids get to experience when young. But the fact that it’s an entry point is precisely the reason it’s so powerful. All cosmetics companies bundle different kinds of male cosmetics and don’t even worry about marketing it to men because it’s the women that buy them for men that primarily drive sales. As a by-product, men become conditioned into a default choice of cosmetics brand when and if they are in a position to choose.",330 followers,Sky Chon,883,87,690.8K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-weird-and-bizarre-business-ideas-that-proved-to-be-successful

Rent-A-ChickenI know what you’re asking: why on earth would someone want to rent a chicken?Well, some people who are interested in urban farming want to get chickens. However, that’s a big step. What if they don’t like caring for chickens? Then, they’re stuck with a coop and several chickens they don’t want.This is where Rent-A-Chicken comes in. This husband and wife team in Traverse City, MI will bring you everything you need to care for a brood of hens for the summer. For $250, you can see whether or not you really want to try raising chickens on your own. In fact, there’s another business just like this in Australia called Rent-A-Chook.Wacky? Yes. Useful? You bet.chicken coup3. Hangover HelpersHere’s the situation: You and your friends were up all night partying. Now, you’re suffering from a horrendous hangover, you’re dehydrated, and your apartment is trashed. The thought of having to make yourself something to eat and then clean up that colossal mess is just too much to handle.So what do you do? You call the Hangover Helpers. These two college guys in Boulder, CO help their hung over clients crawl back into the land of the living with as little pain as possible. The guys show up at your house armed with a breakfast burrito and Gatorade for you. They then clean every room where the party happened. This includes cleaning dishes, pots, and pans, and recycling all of your beer bottles.Think this idea is too crazy to actually work? These guys have already been featured in Forbes Magazine, on CBS, and on the talk show, Regis and Kelly. They have enough business to keep them busy as long as they want.hangover helpers4. The Smashing PlaceHave you ever intentionally broken a plate? I’m talking about when you’re stressed or angry, and you just hurl the thing across the room and watch with a real sense of pleasure as it smashes against the wall. Feels pretty good, right? You might even feel the stress or anger leak right out of you.Well, that’s the whole idea behind The Smashing Place. This business, located in Tokyo, allows clients to come in, buy a plate or a cup of their choice, and smash it against a concrete wall. They can swear, stomp their feet, or do anything else they want to relieve stress. I have a feeling a business like this would really take off in a place like New York.broken blue plate5. I Do, Now I Don’tWhen Josh Opperman’s fiancée left him after a three-month engagement, he was crushed. All she left him was the fancy engagement ring he’d worked so hard to save up for.

Yikes.So he started I Do, Now I Don’t to get even. I Do, Now I Don’t is a website that allows people to sell their engagement rings (or any other fancy jewelry) to other users for way less than going to a jewelry store. Think of it as the Craigslist for fine jewelry.The site has been an incredible success and has been featured on CNN, The Today Show, Fox News, and in The New York Times.i do now i don't6. The Pet LooIf you’ve ever had a pet while living in an apartment, then you know how painful it can be to take them out for potty when it’s 10 degrees with a fierce wind. Or maybe you work long hours and always have to rush home to let them out. Or maybe you’re a senior citizen and it’s hard to make multiple trips in and out of your home.Well, all these reasons are why The Pet Loo was invented. The Pet Loo is a square of fake grass, which sits atop a simple waste containment system that you put inside your home or apartment. It’s just like a mini-backyard where your dog can relieve himself. Although The Pet Loo is based in Australia, similar businesses have sprung up here in the States. Good idea? No doubt.In fact, people are putting their Pet Loos in their laundry rooms, their basements, on balconies, and even in their grass-less backyards.the pet loo","135,261 followers",Hector Quintanilla,5.1K,1.2K,88.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-weird-and-bizarre-business-ideas-that-proved-to-be-successful

In preparation for this move, the state witnessed increased security deployment over the weekend while top political leaders were placed under house arrest last night and curfew was imposed on Monday morning.Modi government's decision will have a big impact on the lives of Kashmir residents. Here's a look at the special privileges hitherto enjoyed by J&K that now stand to be revoked:Special status for J&KArticle 370, which came into force in 1952, empowered J&K to be be a near autonomous state since it limited the Centre's authority to just external affairs, defence, finance and communication.

""GOIs intention is clear & sinister. They want to change demography of the only Muslim majority state in India, disempower Muslims to the extent where they become second class citizens in their own state,"" Mufti tweeted earlier on Monday. She went as far as to call the abrogation ""another partition along communal lines"". But that is a sentiment echoed by many in the state - the abrogation of Article 370, and by extension Article 35A, is seen to open the floodgates so as to speak, enabling Hindus from other parts of India to migrate to the state and thus engineer a demographic transformation.Legislative powersJ&K Assembly will no longer be in a position to clear any significant bills within the state - the balance of power will shift in favour of the Union government. Significantly, in the absence of an elected government in the state the presidential order reportedly states that the state's governor shall exercise the powers of the elected government.Preferential employment opportunitiesUnder Article 35A no outsider could bag a government job. Companies in the state were even forced to hire only locals. The revoking of this rule intends to level the playing field. In a blog post in March, BJP stalwart and former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had claimed that Article 35A crippled J&K's ability to raise financial resources - despite not having enough of it - and denied its people a booming economy, economic activity and jobs. ""No investor is willing to set up an industry, hotel, private educational institutions or private hospitals since he can neither buy land or property nor can his executives do so.
