We are as different from you as a foreign language is from your native language. You must immerse yourself in the autistic community. To learn the “language” of autism, and see how autistic adults interact. What challenges we face. How we think and learn. How we maintain our physical and cognitive balance.The social/educational structure that meets neurotypical (NT) needs, does not accommodate the autistic child’s needsHello Efrayim,You must truly understand that we are very different from NT people in the most fundamental way - we are neurologically different. I cannot emphasize this enough. We are as different from you as a foreign language is from your native language. You must immerse yourself in the autistic community. To learn the “language” of autism, and see how autistic adults interact. What challenges we face. How we think and learn. How we maintain our physical and cognitive balance.The social/educational structure that meets neurotypical (NT) needs, does not accommodate the autistic child’s needs. There will be many accommodations that are needed for that child to thrive as an NT child would. Every “traditional” method must be reassessed to see if it fits the autistic child’s needs. This means how the child is prepared for preschool, their stages of development as well as what they need to develop at that stage of their autistic life. The introduction of concepts, the pace, the duration. The amount of environmental stimulation, such as lighting, sound, smells, how “busy” the room is, how the school clocks “alert” students, the bus ride in… All of it…Autistic people live intense lives because we filter out very little of our environmental stimulation. We also regulate and process this information very differently. We can be affected by a stimulation for weeks as it processes.. This is how deeply we consume all information. A depth of emotions and cognition rarely seen in NT children. In a sense even our concept of time is different than NT time.There will be other comorbid disorders along with the autism. Understand what these can be. I’m ASD, ADHD, dyslexic. have alexithymia, possible PTSD, theory of mind issues, I was hypoxic at birth… So Autism maybe just the tip of the iceberg.Develop, open, clear, concise communication with this child. Be as “matter of fact” about them being autistic as you are with the other students being neurotypical. It is part of your task to help them be autistic not neurotypical. If you hide or shelter them because they are autistic, you lay the foundations of guilt and shame. They must feel totally safe and comfortable expressing their needs. This may be through behavior or other means as well as through spoken language. This is a future autistic adult. They must learn autistic life skills as the other children learn NT life skills. These skills will be different because they are managing different neurological systems.If possible, find autistic peers and adults that can be models of HOW to be autistic. When age appropriate, online connections with other autistic peers and adults is a good substitute. This normalizes this child’s concept and self image of being autistic. Autistic and Neurotypical children are different. The way to teach both groups social interaction is to normalize the differences by letting everyone be true to their nature, not making the autistic child conform to the NT standards. Autistic and NT children need exposure to each other’s differences.Develop your network with autistic adults as advisors. You will see many behaviors you will not understand. Autistic people are all different but there is a common experience we all relate to.. We will not always have “THE” answer for every question, but we can give you a genuine autistic perspective. You can develop this network locally or through on-line groups, forums etc…I hope this gives you some important things to consider and integrate into your class. Best to you all…","15,999 followers",Clare Celea,1.6K,9.5K,35.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-deal-with-my-students-on-the-autism-spectrum

3,"A child with autism generally thrives on structure and routine. A visual timetable is useful and tuning the child into what happens next creates a feeling of security. As a teacher, you need to be able to preempt what is stressful for example a sudden change in routine or a guest speaker and make sure they can cope. It’s very important to know their interests and their strengths so their learning is engaging.

So you don't need to do anything for it till you're done with the Mains exam.In any interview, you can be yourself, or you can be someone else, meaning you put on a facade that isn't you. It depends on you what you want to do - don't assume that being yourself means you'll always get better marks, and don't assume that the interviewers will never be able to tell you're pretending if you try being someone else.UPSC Interview: The Final Frontier | Anudeep IAS Rank 1This is an article from Anudeep Durishetty's blog, which I'd say you definitely should read if you're appearing for the CSE interview. Watch the video he mentions, it is also very useful.General AdviceInterview PrepDuring the InterviewSome Specific FeedbackFinally, to repeat the point I made at the beginning.If you try to be yourself, you'll find that your interviews will be more fun and interesting, to say the least. I've been rejected from two interviews in under 30 seconds (one was more like 10 seconds), and in a few others, had the interviewers trying to convinceIf you decide to pretend to be someone else, make sure you do a good job at it- you should not be below average.If you try to give standard ready-made answers for everything, you should expect standardized, average marks. It is probably safer but also boring.You should have hobbies. Life is nothing without hobbies - I can't imagine how a person can not have at least one. If you don't know your hobby, just make a note of where your time goes everyday for a week. Your hobby is whatever you're spending time on regularly.Don't mention too many hobbies either, though. I like a lot of sports - tennis, soccer, badminton, basketball and others - but I didn't mention any apart from weight-training, because I only like playing them, not reading about them, so I didn't know much about them. And the more you mention, the more material you'll have to cover in your preparation - so find a balance between too little and too much.Finally, take my words with a pinch of salt, and don't try to force-fit them to yourself - you can get a great score even if you don't follow anything I've said.",329 followers,Himanshu Gupta,3.4K,121,4.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-deal-with-my-students-on-the-autism-spectrum

Be genuine while filling up the details of DAF (as bio is the deciding factor). Treat the panel members as your buddies.

AIR 304, UPSC CSE 2018 :)Edit 2: My 2020 interview experience is available hereMy interview was on 15th March 2019. I was the last candidate to be interviewed in the afternoon session. The interview started at 5.15 PM and continued till 5.50–5.55 PM. Here’s a brief of the events and thoughts that I encountered during the process.The day before interview, I shifted to a friends place who lived 30 minutes (by Cab) away from UPSC. I decided not to study anything before interview day and spent my time goofing around, playing badminton and cracking lame jokes. My plan was to sleep by 10, take adequate rest and reach UPSC by 12.30 PM next day.However, life has a funny way to deal with overtly ambitious mortals like me. I couldn't sleep the entire night. I tried everything- Yoga, Meditation, music, deep music- you name it. I couldn’t. Finally, when the morning sun rose and lit up my senses, I got up from the bed, went to the washroom, stood up in front of the mirror and said to myself: ‘It’s alright. Accept it that you haven't slept at all. Accept it that this is not what you planned. But, you can pull this off with same rigour and charisma. Nothing has changed’.I took a cab and reached UPSC by 12.40 PM. There was a queue of candidates outside the UPSC building. Most of them had relatives, friends and in-laws accompanying them. I could see their faces brimming with pride and yet, a sweat or two would occasionally trickle down their faces. It was all there- happiness, anxiety, nervousness and pride. I was alone and saved my share of trouble to someone.At 1 PM, the document verification process began and candidates started entering inside the UPSC building. It was the time to waive off your loved ones. A cacophony of greetings and blessings accompanied hugs and kisses.When you enter the premises, the security personnel escort you towards the central hall. The room was circular and had a huge round dome over it. It had a victorian elegance with walls interspersed by lamps and myriad colorful paintings. I observed the surroundings for a while and noticed the decor. The grandeur and elegance was amusing.We were six people who sat around a round table, and were to be interviewed by the same board, whose identity was still hidden from us. In a way, we shared an unspoken hidden bond. I could see their faces and read ‘we are together on this one, mate’. We completed the formalities, which included filing forms and claiming TA, if any. Meanwhile, we would look at each other and occasionally pass a smile. No words, just smile.I broke the ice. I was fully prepared for this. Before coming, I had ordered my favourite Biryani and brought it to the UPSC premises. I also had black coffee, mineral water, plenty of chocolates and candies. I was in for a feast.

I said ‘I don't know’ to 2–3 questions.The interview lasted for 35–40 minutes. The board was extremely cordial. Zero grilling. Most of the questions were on expected lines. I was surprised because it was very lenient in comparison to the mock interviews that I had given. In mocks, questions were more in depth and grilling component was there.When I came out, I had a big smile on my face. I knew I was confident and smiling throughout. However, I was a little sceptical later as the questions were very basic. But, that wasn't in my hand. I did what I could do.Thanks.","20,361 followers",Ishan Pratap Singh,2.5K,60,1.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-prepare-for-UPSC-interview

Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.Development of Your ThesisA thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement.Strong FormA good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement.StyleJust as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice.ConventionsConventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such asSupport and ReferencesFinally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources,The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider.

It is a practical statistical analysis application that aims at providing practical suggestions. Analysts in this field concentrate on how to apply the insights gained from data. Their goal is to reach concrete business conclusions by answering specific questions about why things are happening, what will happen, or what can be done.The term ""business analytics"" refers to exactly what the words suggest in plain English – ""analysing a business""; rather, analysing the past performance of a company using the newest technologies and methods. Thus, business analytics entails an investigation into why and how the business performance in question was achieved, as well as how it can be established for future decision-making.What exactly is HR Analytics?HR analytics, also known as people analytics, workforce analytics, or talent analytics, entails collecting, analysing, and providing information on HR data. It facilitates your organisation to assess the impact of various HR measures on overall business performance and make data-driven decisions. HR analytics is a data-driven method to Human Resources Management.HR departments are likely to handle more data than ever before, which means that effective data analysis will undoubtedly aid in bringing about important changes in the workplace. According to experts, less than one-fourth of this data is effectively utilised, which brings us back to the original quandary – the importance of business analytics for HR professionals.How BA is Important for HR Analytics?Let's take a simple example: every year, a company, will head-hunt a large number of candidates. At the same time, a significant number of employees are likely to leave for better opportunities elsewhere, and a few may plan to retire. If the company's progress is generally positive, why are some employees considering leaving? Leaving aside the possibility of a few employees wanting to carve out a niche elsewhere, or a few of them wanting to further their education, HR statistics still fail to explain why potential candidates would leave a company that promises growth.One possible explanation for this is a lack of data analysis by HR professionals.Thus, by focusing on data analysis, BA tries to find a reason for a company's success or failure. It aids in the development of optimal solutions for company's future planning and provides insight into effective decision-making.To understand the changing culture of today's workforce, HR managers with a strong understanding of business analytics will need to employ business models and various data interpretation techniques.HR becomes exciting as a result of analytics. The information provided can be used to guide strategic decisions and optimise day-to-day business processes.And if you understand what motivates your employees, you can improve the workplace environment and identify future leaders. Assume you have the ability to predict which employees are most likely to leave the company. This information is useful for long-term succession planning and strategic workforce planning.How do you get started?Approach 1 –Approach 2 –For Business Analytics certification you can choose",34 followers,Bharvi Vyas,1K,70,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-deal-with-my-students-on-the-autism-spectrum
