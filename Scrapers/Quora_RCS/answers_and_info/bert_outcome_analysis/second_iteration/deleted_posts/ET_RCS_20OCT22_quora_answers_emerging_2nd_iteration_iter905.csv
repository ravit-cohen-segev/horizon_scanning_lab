Why aren't they being arrested?9. Do they still have Mad Magazine?10. What happened to all the pay phones?11. Why don't people smoke any more?12. Why do they have government cops searching people who want to get on planes and making them take off their shoes and stuff? I thought you said the Soviet Union ended. What are they afraid of?13. Gas costs THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS? Really? That's insane! How can people afford to go anywhere? Do they just stay home?14. They made a TV show about advertising men and their families in the 1950s and everybody watches it? Why? What's it about? I mean, what would be so interesting about that?15. Is Elvis still around? I mean, I know he would be getting kind of old now.16. Do they still have Andy Griffith? I guess Opie's grown up. What's he up to now?17. What is Facebook? Why don't people just call each other on the phone or meet at a drive-in?18. Why don't men wear hats any more? Were they outlawed?Now I don't mean to imply that all the values implicit in the questions above are admirable, but I'm quite confident that if someone were suddenly transported from the '50s to our own day, the questions above are among the things he or she would ask.","3,053 followers",Anne Agard,7.3K,14K,10.7M,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-from-the-1950s-or-earlier-suddenly-appeared-today-what-would-be-the-most-difficult-thing-to-explain-to-them-about-life-today

6,"There are many things that might be hard for a 1950s person toaccept, such as gay marriage, the end of the Cold War, a black president, female presidential candidates, fears about Global Warming, the fate of the USSR, CGI, nudity on television, modern theories about nutrition, the Human Genome Project, and the many sanctions against smoking.But none of those things would be extremely hard to exThere are many things that might be hard for a 1950s person toaccept, such as gay marriage, the end of the Cold War, a black president, female presidential candidates, fears about Global Warming, the fate of the USSR, CGI, nudity on television, modern theories about nutrition, the Human Genome Project, and the many sanctions against smoking.But none of those things would be extremely hard to explain to a relatively intelligent person with 1950's-level knowledge. I couldn't give such a person adeepunderstanding of the Human Genome Project, but I couldn't do that for a contemporary person, either, because (alas), my knowledge of it isn't all that deep. I'm pretty sure that, given a day, I could bring Mr. 1950 up-to-speed (intellectually) on most of those topics—up to the speed of a contemporary non-specialist.Teaching him to use a modern computer interface would be a much bigger challenge. I'm trying and failing to come up with other contemporary things that would be as hard to teach. I was born back when all telephones had rotary dials, but I didn't find it hard to learn touch-tone ones. Most kitchen devices are pretty unchanged; driving a car hasn't changed all that much; DVD players would be surprising, but they're pretty simple devices to operate. Windows-based computers, though...We're talking about people have never touched a mouse, who have never opened a folder, who have never saved a file, who have never started up an application, who have never run multiple applications at once, who have never seen a cursor, who have never typed continuously without pressing a carriage-return at the end of each line, who have never clicked ""B"" to make text bold, who have never copied and pasted, who have never scrolled, who have never selected text, etc.I'm sure a smart 50s person could learn to do all those things, but it would take a long time and he'd have to overcome a ton of both physical and mental confusion. Most of our UIs, no matter how obvious they seem to us, assume experience with similar UIs.Back in the mid-90s, my job was teaching non-tech-savvy adults how to use the web, and it was very hard for most of them. I'm talking about smart people—experts in their fields—who had simply never touched a computer before.And now the gap is widening, because we have a generation of people who have nevernottouched a computer before. Using a mouse is, for them, like using a doorknob is to previous generations. (Consider that we're born with an understanding of neither. We have to learn how to use doorknobs, but none of us remember learning it.)One smart student of mine got totally confused by files and folders. It took me a while to understand what was hanging him up, and it turned out my insistence on the metaphor—computer files and folders are like physical files and folders—was making things worse.

Some modernist or post-modernist buildings would seem odd, but someone from the 1950s had seen steel and glass boxes and skyscrapers.Really, the environment wouldn't seem so radically new or jarring.The people on the streets would seem very different, however.  In the US, the level of racial integration would be stunning. The idea, everywhere in the US, that a ""Negro"" police officer wouldn't be called a ""Negro"" and that he (or, she) could arrest a white person would be completely foreign. The presence of people of color in positions of power over whites in Europe would be equally jarring.  The role of women, the broad presence of people of color from many backgrounds, and the public integration of life in the US would shock someone from 1954 (the year of Brown v. the Topeka Board of Education). None of that is to say that the US has solved racism or that there isn't still segregation, but compared to 1954, race is very, very different in the US of 2014.  In many European cities, the presence of so many people of color would, likewise, seem completely out of place.  Migration from former colonies to former metropoles is a post-1945 phenomenon, but in 1954 it wasn't as much a part of the fabric of European lives as it is today.In much of Africa, Asia, and Latin America the built environment would have changed a great deal, but in different ways in different places.  Of course, in Africa and Asia, so many of the changes would have to do with the fact that former colonies were now independent nations.  In a country like South Africa, that change would be very tough for a time traveler from 1954 S.A. to comprehend.In the final analysis, I see the social and cultural changes as more profound, and the economic, technological, and scientific as more evolutionary.","47,947 followers",Jedidiah Benhur Margoschis Wisely,4K,168,18.2M,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-from-the-1950s-or-earlier-suddenly-appeared-today-what-would-be-the-most-difficult-thing-to-explain-to-them-about-life-today

Tiny heater.In case you want to prepare lemon tea but you don't have any facility to light a flame so that you can get boiled water ( mostly for Hostel Students ), just take a small wire with plug, for electricity source, two blades, two matchsticks. Assemble all the three things as shown in the figure and put it into your Water. In just 2-3 minutes your boiled water will be ready.Warning : As electricity is very dangerous, please use it with precautions.3. Size of your trouser.At the time of shopping, if you want to buy a new trouser, but you are still unclear whether it will fit you or not, just do a simple thing as shown in the figure below. Put your arm under the trouser as shown in figure, if your arm gets in freely and easily and the trouser does not hang down, then it fits to you.4. Internet Sucks.If anytime there is a problem with your internet and your screen shows this,Then, for timepass just press the space-bar key and the tyrannosaurus on the left handside on top will start to move and a game like super mario will start.Something like this,5. Increase the life of Power cell.If you have some extra power cell at home and you want to use it in near future, then just refer to the simple process given below to increase it's battery life.1. Put all the power cells in one polythene, tie it and put it into a refrigeratorAt low temperature every Chemical reaction procees slowly. So the Chemical reaction in the cell proceeds at a lower rate with time. Which will increase it's battery life.6. Clean the table.If someone tries to tease you and just writes something on your table with marker just like this, to tease you,Then don't get angry. Just spray some perfume or body spray on your table and wrap it up with some paper or a piece of cloth. And then It's gone..!!7.If you are in a hurry for office and you desperately want to iron your shirt but you cannot find where your iron is, then be calm and apply this trick as a solution.Take some hot water in a square bottom container and just smoothly move it on your shirt. Whoa!!! Your shirt get ironed without an iron.P.S.I hope these tricks might help you in your daily life.Thank You.Source : Slivki Show EN",1 follower,Mitesh Patel,11.9K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-from-the-1950s-or-earlier-suddenly-appeared-today-what-would-be-the-most-difficult-thing-to-explain-to-them-about-life-today

This observation and Internet helped me to find out the answer of my question.Round WindowsI wondered many times, why flight windows have round edges and why any flight doesn’t provide normal rectangular or trapezoidal edges like our home windows.Last month I was travelling from Frankfurt to Bengaluru and It was brand new aeroplane and I observed interesting new invention related to Flight windows. This observation and Internet helped me to find out the answer of my question.Round WindowsThe “De Havilland Comet” airplane had same windows as mentioned above in 1950s.With a pressurized cabin, it was able to go higher and faster than other aircraft but in 1953 three planes fell apart in the air, killing 43 people in total.What was reason for such a crash??Answer is quite interesting - WINDOWSWhere there is a corner, there is a weak spot, Square or Rectangular edge windows are having four corners means four potential weak spots, hence crash happened under stress (air pressure). By curving the window edges, air pressure distributed equally and breaking of window at corner reduced. Circular shapes are also stronger and reduce deformation and Circular windows can survive the extreme differences in pressure between the inside and outside of the aircraft.Fortunately intelligent designers figure out the flaw so that we have nice rounded airplane window that can withstand the pressure of cruising altitude. And yes we can gaze out of the window to the world from 35000 feet with amazing view of beautiful landscapes.Below current invention I have observed while travelling.Most of the time air-hostess request passenger to open the cover of the airplane windows. But few airlines found a new invention. Automatic brightness control button. Yes, one doesn’t need to open or close the cover of the window.It was totally new to me, I took 10 minutes to understand why darkness is outside although time was 11 am in Germany. I found one button below the window and out of curiosity I clicked it multiple times and the brightness changed. I was super happy like a small girl. One German couple was sitting behind me and yes they were also confused because of windows.Window was looking like belowI pressed the button and yes brightness changed.I had below conversation with co-passenger,HeMeHeMeHeWe smiled and yes it was amazing. Technology is improving day by day and yeah its coolest fact I came across while travelling.","23,393 followers",Chris Freyler,1.6K,790,66.6M,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-from-the-1950s-or-earlier-suddenly-appeared-today-what-would-be-the-most-difficult-thing-to-explain-to-them-about-life-today

Old Benji thought differently.Franklin once had a very powerful political rival who was hellbent on making his life miserable. Franklin knew that it would be beneficial to have this man on his side, but instead of groveling for his approval, he took a counter-intuitive approach. He knew his rival was in possession of a very rare and valuable book, and simply asked him to borrow it. After a few days, he returned it with a thank you note and, surprisingly, his rival became his friend.What Franklin tapped into is a well-known psychological principle known asIn the case of Franklin, his rival held the belief: “I do not like Benjamin Franklin.” Upon doing him the favor, however, he was forced to come to terms with another belief: “It’s a pain in the ass to do favors for other people, so I only do favors for people I like.” These two beliefs are in conflict, and since he cannot un-loan the book, he was forced to soften and eventually reverse his ill-will towards Franklin.The secret of the Benjamin Franklin effect is this:Now will you please hit that upvote button? ;)",309 followers,Conclude Mabunda,1.5K,251,2M,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-from-the-1950s-or-earlier-suddenly-appeared-today-what-would-be-the-most-difficult-thing-to-explain-to-them-about-life-today

Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects.

So it's anything but difficult to envision that a 30-minute break would cause a considerable measure of issues.

Likewise, their vision would change: the world would be seen through a long dim passage in a manner of speaking. The stars ahead would seem blue, and the stars behind would look red. Also, at a specific speed, a man would just observe murkiness on the grounds that the wavelength of light would be outside the noticeable range.What might have happened if the dinosaurs hadn't become extinct?How about we envision that 65 million years prior a shooting star had flown past earth and hadn't executed the dinosaurs. They would have kept on living their typical lives and warm blooded creatures wouldn't have possessed the capacity to grow more remote than rodents. At the point when the dinosaurs went extinct, a considerable measure of well evolved creatures created and achieved the highlights that they have now.

Okay we won’t do it to EVERY star because some of them will blow up before we’re done.We will only choose the most stable and dull of stars wanting them to last as long as possible before dying. If it can’t be used as a power source for ten billion years, what’s the point?You want to basically design technologies which would map every stellar anomaly, star, black hole, neutron star, magnetron or any other such strange stellar object capable of disrupting space time sufficiently to find it.If we are still using relativistic flight, then everything we build will have to be local and sourced locally. This this process of surrounding a star may take thousands of years each time Humanity sets up residence, builds populations, develops technology, then begins the construction of a social infrastructure sufficient to man and develop the operation of stellar energy gathering. Taking over the galaxy in this fashion would take a million years or more!At this scale of the game we (as modern day Humans) don’t have any idea what we would be doing with all of this energy we are harvesting. What are we turning these surrounded stars into?I am hard pressed to imagine what it would take the collective energy of an entire galaxy to do.As to the question of singularities, why do anything with them?They are tiny, dense, presumably at this point, easy enough to track and avoid. I guess it will depend on how advanced a Level III society’s technology is.Assuming the speed of light is still the limit, even if we could somehow create the technology to move stars and singularities around, I can’t imagine it would be easy, or inexpensive (assuming money is even an issue when you are harnessing the power of entire stars) to do.There would need to be a reason why one would bother with the effort of moving a singularity unless there was something special you could with them, that you couldn’t do with any normal high mass star.It occurred to me, perhaps the only thing they might be good for, even if you couldn’t move them, was the disposal of things you absolutely never wanted to see again. At least for now, we know, once something crosses the event horizon, it is never seen again.Unlike the modern world with our ability to utilize nuclear power, there is the unwanted and toxic side effect (plutonium) capable of being used in a weapon.Perhaps in this super future where we make megastructures capable of surrounding stars, generation ships moving at great percentages of the speed of light, automated robotic technologies capable of converting entire worlds into their component atoms and reconstructing them into other megastructures around the star to maximize the use of every photon streaming away from it there is a potential to create some newBlack holes/Singularities would be come the ultimate garbage system when you absolutely had to be sure, you would never see that particular thing again. I can see future societies mapping and blockading their black holes, particularly if they can be moved or stolen.Did I mention weaponizing those neutron stars and black holes?It’s called aBy the time we can do all of this and more, one would think we would be past making weapons capable of destroy entire sections of the galaxy.What the heck is a Matrioska Brain, anyway?A Matrioshka Brain is a hypothetical megastructure, based on theSuch a structure would be composed of a collection of one or more (typically more) Dyson spheres built around a star, and nested one inside another. A significant percentage of the shells would be composed of nanoscale computers (see molecular-scale computronium). These computers would be at least partly powered by the energy exchange between the star and interstellar space. A shell (or component, should a Dyson swarm be the design model used) would absorb energy radiated onto its inner surface, utilize that energy to power its computer systems, and re-radiate the energy outwards. The nanoscale computers of each shell would be designed to run at different temperatures; shells or components at the core could be nearly as hot as the central star, while the outer layer of the Matrioshka Brain could be almost as cool as interstellar space.The ideal mechanism for extracting usable energy as it passes ""through"" a shell or component, the number of shells (or orbital levels) that could be supported in such a manner, the ideal size of the shells to be constructed, and other details, are all issues of speculation.This structure has clear structural analogies to Russian Matrioshka dolls, from which the concept derives its name.The idea of the Matrioshka Brain violates none of the currently known laws of physics, although the engineering details of building such a structure would be staggering, as such a project would require the ""disassembly"" of significant portions (if not all) of the planetary system of the star for construction materials. Since it is based on the concept of the Dyson sphere, objections to the feasibility of a Matrioshka Brain are more thoroughly explored in the article of the Dyson sphere as difficulties with the Dyson Sphere itself.The things we didn’t talk about in this essay boggle the mind. Suffice it to say, given the capacities of a Type III civilization, we just can’t imagine what they would be doing with all of this capacity because we haven’t any idea of what they would be doing with all that energy. What could required that kind of resource manipulation? Would singularities be worth more than the average, long lived star?Maybe if your civilization were to last more than a ten to twenty trillion years, you might be stuck huffing singularities for their scraps, smashing them together for gravity waves or some other exotic energy.But who knows, if a species can last that long, maybe they will have opted for any number of other ways of living, digitizing their consciousness and slinging themselves slowly into the event horizon of super-massive black holes slowing the flow of time for themselves, extending their civilization’s last gasp by another few billion years until even black holes evaporate and the universe gives up its final ghosts as energy fades and the universe becomes a dull, bland single temperature across infinity and there is nothing left in the Universe at all.

Stars, like all things, eventually die. Big stars collapse into black holes. Little stars either fizzle or explode and seed other stars. Eventually this birth-death cycle will end . All of the concentrated matter will be fused into Iron or collapsed into black holes and there will be no more stars. When the stellar age ends, the black hole age begins. Hawking radiation from black holes will be the primary source of energy in the universe.

Its no more dangerous than a star of the same mass (and they have less mass than many stars since a lot of the potential mass is blown away in the nova that creates them) as long as you don’t try to run into the thing. Similarly, a star outputs copious amounts of energy, a black hole does not. You may have energy of the accretion disk or xray jets, but still, a normal star is a better energy source, as its actively perfThey don’t need contained or destroyed, and don’t have much harnessable energy.

You may have energy of the accretion disk or xray jets, but still, a normal star is a better energy source, as its actively performing fusion and emitting energy. A black hole is merely dense. You could drop things in if you can harness the gravitational potential energy, but thats not a particuarly effective way to get energy. Maybe if there is some other reason you want to be in its stellar system and thats your only option you could figure out something functional, but you wouldn’t seek out a black hole for a power source.",2 followers,Richard Muller,2.9K,2.3K,202M,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-from-the-1950s-or-earlier-suddenly-appeared-today-what-would-be-the-most-difficult-thing-to-explain-to-them-about-life-today

That four million solar masses is a lot compared to our solar system, but it is absolutely puny compared to the total mass of the Milky Way, which is many tens ofGalaxies are held together by self-gravity. They may or may not have a supermassive black hole (not all do). When that supermassive black hole is present, its gravity adds a modest contribution to the total self-gravity of the galaxy. But in all cases, even in the case of the largest black holes, the mass of the galaxy dominates over the mass of the black hole. Stars in a galaxy follow somewhat chaotic orbits, determined by the combined gravitational field of all other stars, clouds of gas, clouds of dust, and well, any black holes if present, supermassive or otherwise. But apart from stars that are relatively near the black hole in question, stuff in general does not orbit the black hole.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,928,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-from-the-1950s-or-earlier-suddenly-appeared-today-what-would-be-the-most-difficult-thing-to-explain-to-them-about-life-today
