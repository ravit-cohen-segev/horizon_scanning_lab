0,"A2A: How long have data centers been around?As long as there have been large scale computing systems. Twenty or so years ago I worked for a company whose servers were located in a datacentre in a blast-proof bunker next to a steelworks. It had been built in the 1970s to house the accounting systems of British Bakeries, and there were still a couple of bits of elderly but interesting comms hardware that connected the offices to the servers, which over the years had shrunk from occupying most of the 3,000 sq ft space to a couple of racks of modern servers.",21 followers,Jeff Nelson,512,1.6K,23M,https://www.quora.com/How-long-have-data-centers-been-around

Computers - particularly in the early days - were super fragile and needed tightly conditioned power and cooling. You would typically build a building or re-build part of a building around the requirements of the computer.If you’re talking about modern Internet data centers…Back at the dawn of the World Wide Web, computers serving content were frequently small “business server” grade systems, using whatever Internet access happened to be available to them at their location. By the mid 1990s, it was clear that wasn’t scaling - running a large ISP in Houston, we had “web site” customers with 56kbps or 128kbps dedicated connections from their homes or offices to our main routing core.For everyone in the business, it was clear that didn’t scale - by the time I was at Genuity in 1995, we had customers with multiple 1.5Mbps lines trying to stuff content back into “The Internet”.To address this, there were three things that happened.First, Jay Adelson, Al Avery and their band of merry men (most ex-DEC) founded Equinix, the first site built just to house customer computers for connection to the Internet. The original Equinix data center was built on the basis of real estate prices, and required Internet connections to be pulled from the various ISP networks to that location, better than individual connections per customer, but not ideal. This was really the birth of the neutral third party data center business.Second, at Genuity we developed the notion of building customer data centers directly on the backbone - when we acquired space for core routers, we also took down thousands of square feet for customer computing equipment which we provided to customers for our ISP services. Buy a connection from us, we’ll sell you spaceOther companies soon figured out that if they needed enough space, it might be cheaper for them to build adjacent to these big carrier colocation data centers, and then just sort of “throw cables over the wall” to get the Internet services which they needed. In this period, roughly 2000 onward, there was a huge amount of data center buildout as every company that wanted a huge web presence had to build their own data centers.That was roughly state of play up until somewhere around 2004, where the notion that not only did you not want to have your public facing servers at your location, but maybe you didn’t even want to own them at all. Maybe you didn’t want to own servers, or a data center. Maybe you just wanted compute cycles, and bandwidth, and storage.With the birth of Amazon AWS and competing services, and the coincident massive expansion of Facebook and other consumer web based services, and teh advent of huge volumes of streaming content, we see the shift into the third phase - hyperscale data centers. Data centers so big you can’t really comprehend them, because they’re bigger than any one company could possibly use — unless that company is Google, or Facebook, or Amazon, or…So data centers per se have been around for a long time. Internet data centers really sort of started in 1995, and hyperscale data centers about ten years later.","36,276 followers",Stan Hanks,594,7.7K,65.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-long-have-data-centers-been-around

I also know Japanese have been so modest and not so much care about money at least from many centuries ago. I also know Japanese have been so good at absorb foreign knowledge from anciant times. But those seems not to constitutes the good answer or hints to you. Because Japan's economic growth has significantly stopped from 30 years ago, and I cannot see the technological innovations these days well.I just think that it could just a kind of miracle that Japan achieved many bests in technology areas until around 1990s when the Soviet collapsed and the global age bagan.","4,123 followers",Boris Sanochkin,674,5.4K,26.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-long-have-data-centers-been-around

We like you, but one of these days our two countries are going to go to war.” The American replied, “Yeah… I know.”Conflict between the U.S. and Japan was sort of inevitable. From the 1860s on, both countries had displayed an intermittent desire for territorial expansion into the Pacific. This desire grew stronger over time. When the U.S. fleet attacked the Spanish at Manila, for instance, it was shadowed by a Japanese flotilla. Turns out, the Japanese also had their eyes on the Philippines at the end of the 19th century. After the Japanese acquired many of the German islands in the Pacific as League of Nations mandates, after World War I, both countries began to wargame and plan a possible “Pacific War.” Predictions and descriptions of such a war were published in the U.S. in the mid-1920s.Although Japan and the U.S. normally had fairly cordial relations, both countries were expanding their political, cultural, and economic influence in many of the same places at the same time. The Pacific was one of the few parts of the world where the two powers were on a more or less equal footing, and where they didn’t have to play second fiddle to one of the major European colonial powers. The Pacific was vital for the defense and economic well being of both Japan and the U.S., and it was up for grabs. By the mid-1930s, with Japanese aircraft “accidentally” bombing U.S.-flagged gunboats in China (USS Panay, 1937), conflict seemed inevitable, and both countries began to build up their naval and other forces in anticipation of a future war.With the Japanese invasion of China, in the 1930s - a place where the U.S. had a lot of investments - tensions between Japan and the U.S. heightened dramatically. Before long, the two countries were engaged in a proxy war, with the U.S. aiding the Chinese nationalists, and at that point all-out war, with the Pacific as the prize, was only a matter of time.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,1.2K,5.6K,426.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Japan-have-the-best-technology-in-the-world-if-the-United-States-is-the-wealthiest-country

So, it’s never going to carry any kind of real payload.This is, basically, a very simple, stripped-down version of the top half of what used to be known as the BFR, and is now known as Starship.It is meant to be used to test the new Raptor methane/LOX engines, under simple test conditions. It will proceed to launch itself upward, likely, on the first flight, less than 12″ into the air, and then return to Earth.If you want a better idea of what I mean, go look up the Grasshopper test programPersonally, when it comes to any payload, my guess is that it will have a segmented water tank on it, to simulate different weights on return in order to simulate landing with and without cargo.Fundamentally, SpaceX is starting with a new, untested spaceship, flying on new, untested rocket engines. Although they have simulations, and they have tested the Raptor engines on a test stand in MacGregor, Texas, they need to see how they respond in an actual craft, under actual work conditions.For example: The Raptor engines have never been fired vertically to my knowledge.So, they are building a test article, using low-pressure tanks, actually welded together by a water-tower building company on-site at Boca Chica. This means they have merely to wheel it down the road about 2 miles to the (still under construction) launch pad to test it. That’s a lot cheaper than barging something all the way from California, through the Panama Canal, and then over-landing it from the nearest port.So, it’s a test article. A lot of people are complaining that it looks too “redneck” to be a real craft, but it’s exactly in-line with the “agile development” philosophy that Elon brings with him from the software world.This thing will probably cost less than a quarter million dollars to assemble using water-tower techniques. That’s about the same cost as you would pay for a year of computer specialist simulator time, and unlike the simulator, this test will give him real, concrete answers.It always reminds me of the scene in Terminator 2, where the tow truck crashes off the bridge. Cameron was told that the special effect was going to take six months and cost between 2 and 3 million dollars to do. He asked how much the tow truck cost.“About $150,000.”“So, it would cost 20 times less to just actually drive the tow truck off the bridge?”“Uh…. yeah.”“Let’s drive the tow truck off the bridge.”Which leads me to how this conversation probably went down with Elon and Gwynne Shotwell.Gwynne says, “I know you want to get BFR off the ground, Elon, but, hey, it’s going to take 6 months just to simulate the new stainless steel design, and determine how to work with the engines, and get the guidance package adjusted, and all the throttling, and test the avionics. And that’s if we have 50 people working on it, which is a $10M line item in the budget. And then we’ll still have to do hop tests on the $50M first Starship to roll off the line, starting in November or December of 2019.”Elon rubs his chin, “What if we built a simple hopper? We already have three Raptor engines we could stick on it. Then we could fly it in a month!”“But that’s not going to be space-worthy!”“It’s only going to fly up a few feet at first, and eventually up to 5km or so. We don’t need a space-worthy craft for that.”“Well, yeah…”“And by the time we’re done with that series of tests and have all the kinks worked out of the avionics, we’ll have a full scale Starship done, meaning we can start real high-altitude tests as soon as we have a real craft ready to do it.”“Uh… yeah… I suppose so…”“And we can build this one right out in the open since it doesn’t need any of the super-tight tolerances and space-age materials. That’s going to excite the crap out of everyone — especially as we’re trying to get new investors for SpaceX.”“Yeah, sure.”“And then, we can be flying a sort of BFR before the first piece of SLS even makes it to Canaveral, which looks even better for SpaceX, and is going to get us a lot of interest for super-heavy payloads.”“Definitely.”“And it’ll save us $10M of simulation that really won’t prove anything.”“Yeah…”“So, it’s a win-win-win-win scenario.”“Yeah, but it’ll look so… well… like someone built it in a garage!”“Yeah, it’ll drive everyoneAnd this happened:",565 followers,John Catiller,1.8K,18.1K,31.7M,https://www.quora.com/How-long-have-data-centers-been-around

This in turn enables Starship to theoretically be much cheaper to launch than even the already very cheap Falcon 9. Currently a Falcon 9 has a marginal launch cost of about $28 million (assuming some unspecified number of reuses). Elon Musk optimistically believes that it’s possible for Starship to reach a marginal launch cost of just $2 million (assuming many reuses). I and many others are skeptical that they’ll achieve costs quite that low, but even if it’s 10x greater that’s still cheaper than Falcon 9 while delivering several times more payload.(Above: A render of a Starship delivering roughly 400 Starlink satellites).“Okay, but that doesn’t explain why it’s so huge?”Also, by having a large diameter hull, the tiles (which need to be a certain thickness to provide sufficient insulation) comprise a smaller percentage of the total vehicle’s mass. Aerodynamic drag also has its portion of deltaV losses reduced as a greater percentage of each engine’s thrust is now instead used to lift the rocket’s mass (which increases at a third order ratio to diameter vs second order ratio for cross sectional area). To be clear, making rockets larger makes them more difficult to design and manufacture, but being more efficient for full reusability is nevertheless a positive side effect.2) The second reason is that Elon Musk and SpaceX want to make humanity a multi-planetary species (it’s literally in the company’s mission statement). This means building a rocket capable of transporting very large and heavy payloads at low cost to Mars (and other bodies in the solar system) so that colonies can be established and eventually grown to become self-sustaining. Starship’s ability to deliver 100+ tonnes of payload to Mars and elsewhere at“But who would be willing to fund a colony on Mars?”For him and in the eyes of a number of others, doing this will help humanity and life in general survive within our solar system against threats such as large asteroid impacts, nuclear war, etc.Lastly, and arguably just as importantly:“You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past.

This was envisioned as a fast turn around, cheap to operate shuttle system that would make access to space quick and easy. Unfortunately the original NASA concept was shanghaied by congress and the military that wanted something capable of carrying a school bus sized payload that was the state of the art in 1970s spy satellites. This resulted in an inelegant solution where an unbalanced external fuel tank was required, as well as dirty great strap on SRBs that severely compromised the vehicle safety.As a result the Shuttle never lived up to its original design promise, and turn around times never got better than 54 days (Atlantis 1985). The biggest issue was the 21,000 bespoke heat tiles that were individual to each orbiter, and required an inordinate amount of refurbishment after each flight, yet were so fragile that they could be catastrophically damaged by being struck by some falling insulation foam.This meant that far from becoming the gateway to cheap and fast space flight, the Shuttle blew out launch costs to the order of $85,000 per kg to LEO (although this did substantially fall with time).Launch system prices first dipped, then increased in cost after the Shuttle retired in 2011, with systems like the Delta IV heavy costing $350 million to send 28 tonnes to LEO. Launch costs were steadily climbing with each year until SpaceX suddenly popped up and offered a heavy lift capacity at a bargain price with the first Falcon 9s.Musk then proceeded to defy the “experts” and successfully develop a propulsively landed 1st stage booster for the Falcon, which itself brought a substantial saving in launch fees ($50 million compared to $65 million), while at the same time increasing the Falcon’s performance.The Development of the Falcon Heavy was another evolutionary step in reducing launch costs, but this was nowhere near what Musk wants if he wishes to make his dreams of colonising Mars a reality. Merely halving the costs is not enough, they have to be orders of magnitude lower than the current norm for mass space expansion to occur, and this requires full reuse and rapid turn around times. Musk basically took the original Space Shuttle concept, but used his own interpretation and led a team that was physics driven instead of politically controlled.The resultant Starship system has a far higher payload capacity than the Shuttle ever had, but instead of costing somewhere in the vicinity of a billion dollars per flight, he is expecting it to cost SpaceX something in the order of $2 million per flight once the construction costs are amortized over 100 successive launches. And what’s more, while the physics of the Shuttle limited it to LEO, the Starship is designed right from the start to be a deep space vehicle, and the use of orbital refuelling effectively adds a third stage to the vehicle with no sacrifice of payload capacity.If you compare the capacities of the “competing” SLS with Starship, it gets even more stark. The SLS, like the Shuttle will cost around the billion dollar mark for each launch (eventually), but will only be capable of delivering a 26 tonne payload to the moon (eventually rising to 45 tonnes). Starship will cost $10 million to send 100 tonnes to the moon (several refuelling flights will be needed). This equates to $38,500 per kg delivered to the moon for the SLS, compared to $100 per kg for the Starship.If a 385x reduction in costs is not game changing, then I don’t know what is. Oh, and one last thing, while it takes several years for each new SLS to be built, used once and lost, it only takes SpaceX less than a month to mass produce a new Starship which is expected to provide hundreds of reflights with almost no refurbishment necessary.","8,614 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Japan-have-the-best-technology-in-the-world-if-the-United-States-is-the-wealthiest-country

Instead it must do the (frankly terrifying) “suicide burn” or “hover-slam” landing where it leaves it to the last possible moment to re-light it’s engine - slows down with alarming rapidity and then cuts the engine before it’ll lift off again. All of this has to be timed perfectly to arrive at exactly at zero altitude and at precisely zero speed…despite accelerating hard.The slightest error of timing, thrust or altitude - and it’ll slam into the ground at high speed - or re-launch and crash when it runs out of fuel.Fortunately, the Raptor is able to throttle down to less thrust than Merlin…but still, this is a technological nightmare!BETTER STILL:If you only have one motor - and it fails - then everyone dies.If you have two motors and one of them fails - then everyone still dies.But if you have nine motors (as Falcon-9 does) and one of them fails, you can have enough thrust to make it to orbit and return for a safe landing - and life is good.For StarShip - there are TWO additional complications:MARS and THE MOON !!The critical problem to solve is the upper stage - it has to be able to land on Mars - with just 38% of the gravity of Earth - so one motor, throttled all the way back has to have little enough thrust to land the spacecraft.Fortunately, it’s going to have around 100 tonnes of supplies and equipment which more or less doubles the empty weight of the spacecraft.But for landing on the Moon…one SIXTH the gravity of Earth. Throttling down even a single engine - running (deliberately inefficiently) with a small nozzle is going to require a really low amount of thrust.This is one reason why the plans for the NASA version of StarShip may have a ring of really tiny rocket motors for landing on the Moon. (Not the only reason…)VACUUM OPTIMIZED VERSUS SEA LEVEL OPTIMIZED:When operating in atmosphere, for best efficiency, rocket motors need fairly small nozzles - but when in a vacuum, they need as large a nozzle as you can possibly manage.So it ends up having half of the motors with small nozzles and half with large nozzles. With a bunch of small motors - this is a very do-able thing.SUPER - HEAVYWhen you look at the SuperHeavy launch vehicle - with THIRTY or so rocket motors…this seems to be going too far…even at 100% thrust one rocket motor isn’t enough to land this behemoth.It certainly COULD be designed with a handful of much bigger motors…but why?Why design an entire new rocket motor just for SuperHeavy?By sharing the same design, the same propellants, the same control software - they end up with a cheaper design.MANUFACTURING:Unlike most rockets - SpaceX plan to build THOUSANDS of StarShips and probably a hundred or more SuperHeavies.With spares - they’ll probably need between ten and twenty THOUSAND rocket motors!This is completely unprecedented - it’s rare for most rocket motors to ever be built in quantities over a hundred to so.This means that the Raptor engine will be the first every to be truly mass-produced…production-line style.SpaceX have gone another step forward by choosing to use 3D printing techniques to build most of the parts.Having a larger number of smaller motors makes mass-production more useful than a smaller number of larger motors.Also, building a 3D printer large enough to build a Raptor engine is pretty tough - but building one large enough to make a six times larger motor would be much, much harder.SO WHY HASN’T THIS BEEN DONE BEFORE?Historically, the idea of using lots of smaller motors hasn’t been necessary because it’s been all about launching massive loads - and not about landing lightweight loads.One classic example where they tried a bunch of smaller motors was the Soviet “Moon Rocket” - the N1.It famously only flew four times - exploding impressively each time.The REASON it failed was simply that they didn’t have the computer technology to properly synchronize all of those motors - resulting in control instabilities that rapidly became fatal.",196 followers,Chang Liu,3.1K,7.1K,23.2M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Japan-have-the-best-technology-in-the-world-if-the-United-States-is-the-wealthiest-country
