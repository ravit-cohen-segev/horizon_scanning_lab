Your frustration is a part of your natural desire to focus on building your life in a meaningful direction in your early years. From 44 - 65 is the time for mature adulthood. A time to enjoy and refine the life you have worked so hard on . From 66 to your death is a return to a less structured and more open life of exploring and creating new things and enjoying the fruits of your work.A successful human life is to become aware of how to use this short time we have to create and leave something behind. This could be anything. It's different for each of us. Keep asking questions and stay open to what's happening all around you and your path will reveal itself to you.

People dissect their failures for causes and effects, but seldom deal with them and gain experience to master them and thereby avoid their recurrence.

I was let-off from the police, the trail lasted 2.5 years, (ended in 2015), I had insurance for third party (the injured girl), but i had to give them Rs 45,000/- extra to settle the case down, and another Rs 25000/-  to my lawyer to fight my case. and i was broke again in 2015 after 3 years of hard-work.I am extremely grateful to the Saket court Judge who helped me get out of this and removed all the charges from me, otherwise my life would have been ruined as i would not be able to join the government service, which i am preparing for.

I stayed close to the airport and so whenever I could hear an aircraft closing in, I would run to the terrace to watch it in close quarters. I always marveled at the magnificent engineering involved in the design of aircraft.How would it be to fly to a different country, miles away! I wondered. I envied the fliers. How great would it be to say “I am working abroad” or “I have a flight to New York tonight,” I envisaged.Since I did not have a job, I helped two guys in the neighborhood with their English2011.I was in Madras, jobless, counting the number of Royal Enfield motorcycles and flights. I stayed close to the airport and so whenever I could hear an aircraft closing in, I would run to the terrace to watch it in close quarters. I always marveled at the magnificent engineering involved in the design of aircraft.How would it be to fly to a different country, miles away! I wondered. I envied the fliers. How great would it be to say “I am working abroad” or “I have a flight to New York tonight,” I envisaged.Since I did not have a job, I helped two guys in the neighborhood with their English assignments. They liked the work. They asked me if I could train them in speaking English fluently. I had never done that, but I agreed. They paid me.My family was not happy with that. ‘You have an Engineering degree and you are teaching English. This is shameful. What would we tell relatives about this?” they asked.I ignored them and continued tutoring those guys. I was paid INR 1000 for three months. That was my first pay.I threw a dinner party for my brothers. I told them how happy I was.I registered my name in a portal. I got some offers. I started teaching English. It progressed in small yet steady steps. I had small-group sessions. Groups of 5 became 10.In six months, there were no more small-group sessions. I had to use my hall to accommodate 25 students.The business had just started. Money started kicking in. I increased the fee. I had just started earning a lot of money.I started wearing good clothes. I bought a laptop. My lifestyle changed.Pause.A few things never changed, however. I still ran to the terrace to check on flights. I still counted Royal Enfield motorcycles. I still threw parties to share my happiness.Gradually, I expanded my horizons into IELTS, TOEFL, GRE, GMAT, SAT and PTE.My family became alarmed at this.“It was fine when you did those for the time being. You cannot rely on these for a lifetime. There are people qualified to teach and you will never be able to stand the competition,” they voiced their concern.I cut through the noise and saw their love, yet I did not let the words sink in. I did what I should.The most important step I took was this: I shut my personal business and started working for an organization.This helped me grow. I was able to take my mind away from generating money. I focused on my craft. I became better everyday.To grow professionally, I applied for my CELTA program.(CELTA is a high-profile certification program by the Cambridge University. It is particularly known for its rigorous standards. People with CELTA certificates get opportunities to teach English abroad, in simple terms)I applied through the British Council, Madras. Cambridge is wickedly fastidious in choosing the course takers so that quality is not compromised.To be considered for the course, I was asked to write a few essays. I did. I was rejected.“You do not meet the standard requirements, Ben” I was told.That was destructive to my confidence. They just said that my English was not good enough.How had I been teaching so far then? Maybe what my parents said was right?I started doubting myself. My confidence dwindled. It took five months for me to recover. Those five months were painfully lifeless.I started working on myself again. I postponed my CELTA plan. I started learning even more aggressively.Years went on. I bought my own Royal Enfield in the meantime.One day, I went to the same airport. This time, however, I was not there to watch flights.I was there to fly. I had got a job in Dubai.Six months after I reached Dubai, I applied for my CELTA here. The same application process.This time, I had improved myself. The earlier rejection was for the better.I got selected for the course. Two months later, I earned my CELTA.I teach English to people from various countries. I also train students for English Proficiency Tests and high stakes exams such as SAT, GRE, and GMAT.I am on Quora now. It has been less than a month. I have been receiving a lot of encouraging messages and comments from people.I have also been receiving these from some:“Your writing is unnatural” “You do not write like a native user of the language”“You are being superficial” “Indians can never write like the natives. Stop trying”“How could you say that you are an English Instructor when you make so many mistakes?”I ignore these. I do not have time for these. I am busy working on my craft. I am still learning. I still have my future plans.I still admire aircraft. I still count Royal Enfield motorcycles in Dubai. I still celebrate my successes with friends.When I knew a little, I taught people who knew nothing. When I knew something, I taught people who knew a little.There is always room for giving and appreciating what you have. I still appreciate what I have.Gratitude reciprocates.No one is a failure. To stop feeling this way, appreciate what you have and Universe has a weirdly good habit of giving back.Cheers, people :)A few friends and I, having a good time :)To know about CELTA, visit","8,838 followers",Marlon Brandy,3.7K,578,8M,https://www.quora.com/I-am-turning-25-this-weekend-I-still-havent-found-a-job-that-I-love-being-an-engineering-graduate-It-feels-like-I-am-good-at-practically-nothing-Am-I-already-a-failure-when-others-my-age-are-successful-by-leaps-and-bounds

My parents thought I was hopeless.By every measure, I was a failure.But somehow, I managed to graduate from college and got my first full-time job doing data entry. Oh and by the way, I was rejected by 99% of the other places I applied to.The moment I realized that I really needed to make a change in my life was when I saw a 30 year old coworker (Harvard graduate) doing the same exact work I was doing. He looked miserable and confused.At age 23, I didn’t have any ‘important accomplishments’. But the one thing I did know was that I sure as hell didn’t want to turn out like Mr. Harvard grad (never thought I’d say that in my lifetime).That’s when one of my best friends told me about digital marketing. The moment I started to learn about it, I was hooked.I ended up juggling an unpaid internship along with my full-time gig and changed my hours. Instead of coming in from 9–5pm, I came in from 6–2pm. When I got home, I would spend the rest of the time doing internship work and studying until 12am.I kept repeating this cycle over and over and when I felt confident enough, I applied for a job. I got that job ($12,000 raise).Once I felt like I outgrew that job, I went to work somewhere else ($6,000 raise).Guess what happened? A month later, I felt like I outgrew that job and was looking for another growth opportunity and ended up taking a $4,000 pay cut.Wait what? A pay cut? But aren’t you supposed to stay at one place and climb the corporate ladder?3 months later, I left that place and got a $20,000 raise.I got bored again so I tried to start my own company. The company I was working for found out and fired me.Oops.I used to think it was all about making money. That’s just the way I was brought up. Asian parents push you hard to get a great job so you can make good money and while that sounds good on paper, that logic has holes.Life isn’t about making money. The money is just a result of the value that you bring to the table.Here’s what happened in the next few years:At the end of the day, it’s all about growth.That’s what you want: constant progress.Don’t think about chasing the money.Want to feel successful?Example?The ones that really win in life are the ones thatKeep learning and pushing. You’ll get there.I promise.How do I know? Because I’m nothing special. If I can do it, you can do it.Here are some final thoughts:Note to self: I still need to work on some of these :)Good luck!P.S.

Had absolutely no work or research experience because his parents told him to focus on studies, and spent his free time playing videogames.By all rights, even without experience, he still has a fairly impressive resume. Went to a good college, has a masters degree. He even had some contacts within Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Or at least he had some friends who submitted his resume to HR. He even got called in for interviews, did a bunch of tests that he thought he did well on, but he just never really made it in. Eventually he got hired at some small company and now works there, but hates his job. He desperately wishes he could join some cool start up that offered awesome benefits and has a good reputation. He seemed to think the only reason he didn't have a girlfriend was because his job just wasn't good enough to compete for girls in the Silicon Valley.If he ever asked me, I would've told him it was his personality.He was one of the most negative, depressed, individuals I knew. I hesitate to call him whiny, but it was difficult to have conversations with him because he had a serious inferiority complex. Sure, he became really animated when we talked about things he was interested in (videogames, anime, etc), but the rest of the time, he was just so negative about everything. Every problem in his life, he had an explanation or excuse for. He was still crushed by his high school experience where he was an underachieving guy who didn't really have many friends.It didn't help that he spent his free time playing games or browsing reddit. He just didn't get out into the real world enough to learn how to relate to real people. Things that are posted online to sound witty or sarcastic, sounds rude and abrasive in reality.Maybe you're nothing like him, but you sound like you're stuck in a similar rut. It sounds like you moved away from your parents, so that gives you some breathing room to experiment.Passion doesn't just come to everyone, you have to go out and look for it. Volunteer in your area. Put your degree and intelligence to use. Tutor kids, poor or rich. Get out and interact with people. The only way to build real world experience is to go out do something. Anything. Take a class, learn something new, sign up for random workshops, do martial arts. Just do something.One classmate I knew, worked as a tutor during his summers. Eventually, he saw that the tutoring place he was working at could really benefit from a better database program to keep track of student records. He started a pet project to design a database for the school and worked on it on and off for a few years until he graduated. By the time he graduated, he'd finished it and the school was using it. After that, he showed his design to several tech companies in the Bay and got a ton of positive feedback, he had his pick of companies he could work for.He never would've designed it if he hadn't worked as a tutor. He never had a passion for designing databases, nor for edutech. He just saw a problem, thought it was annoying to keep records on excel, and decided to make a program to make his job easier. It just turned into a bigger thing than he imagined.Inspiration to do things comes from experiencing life. You just need to get out more and try new things, and you just might find something that will inspire you to do something.",302 followers,Ayo Okoro,1.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/I-am-turning-25-this-weekend-I-still-havent-found-a-job-that-I-love-being-an-engineering-graduate-It-feels-like-I-am-good-at-practically-nothing-Am-I-already-a-failure-when-others-my-age-are-successful-by-leaps-and-bounds

I’ve had one car reposDude.I’m going to be thirty in five months.I’m just going to do a quick rundown of 18-now:I got married to a horrible, sociopath, pathological liar with one child that she tried to poison by drinking obscene amounts of liquor and then breastfeeding. Then, I put another baby in her.She cheated on me. A lot. Like, the entire time we were together. My daughter might not be biologically mine, though I’ll never know, because I don’t care to check.I got a divorce. Oh yeah, I forgot, at this point I’ve been addicted to oxycodone (and opiates in general) for the last five years. I’ve had one car repossessed, and I’m about to have another one repossessed. Ok, so I got that divorce, and took custody of my daughter, because her mother decided that she wanted to PARTY (which she did), so I was a single parent, dealing with drug addiction (though I was NEVER super high with my daughter; I did almost all of my drugs at work), and the depression of my divorce-in-process.I meet this amazing woman, but I don’t feel like I’m good enough for her, even though she loves me and my daughter more than air, and she’s made that very clear. I chase her off, akin to the way Arya Stark had to chase her dire wolf off to save it from getting caught and killed, but she waited on the sidelines.When I got super sick from not having my drug, and having the flu (sweet trade), she rushed back to my side and took care of me. I got kicked out of that apartment for: you guessed it, spending my rent money on drugs. Still, at this point, I had never sacrificed my daughter’s needs for my addiction; she had the best of everything.My new woman moved me into her stepfather’s house (with him), and convinced me to get clean. I started the process, which terrified the fucking shit out of me. Then, I had my car repossessed again, just as my lady’s car was taken by her father (not her stepfather).We had to get a car from one of those “buy here, pay here” places, and we got a 29% interest rate on a POS Scion iQ that we would later find out had been totaled and illegally resold under a false Carfax. We spent thousands of dollars on engine issues.Fast forward to 2018: this woman is the love that I never knew existed. We have what seems to be a magical relationship, so I marry her, even though I swore I never would again. I celebrate three years clean and sober on May 6, 2018, and a month later, I finally graduate from my five-year apprenticeship with the IBEW. I’m finally an AJ electrician, making $46.75 an hour. I made it. I did it. Then, for Christmas, we get rid of the POS Scion, and buy a brand new 2019 Kia Soul together.We’re still living with her stepfather, but that’s going to change. Everything is going to change, because we kept our heads down and pushed forward. We had to sacrifice, we had to cry at the difficulties and enjoy the happy times when they came, but we’re making it. I’ll be thirty in five months. I have a credit score of about 500, and it’s going to be very difficult to make it better, even with my salary.But I know I can do it. And I know you can do it.It doesn’t matter. The shitty things don’t matter. You can get a better job, you can find a wonderful partner, you can do great things. You feel old at 26, but you’ve only begun, my friend. You still have so much time to make things happen.I’ll tell you what. Comment back here when you’re 36, and if you’re still feeling the same way, I’ll eat my boots. But I’m fairly confident that my boots are safe, because it takes a bit of desperation for some people to turn everything around.Keep your chin up, friend. If you work hard, and don’t let the tough times break you, you’ll be fine. I’m fine. You’ll be fine.",0 followers,M Kam,834,0,0,https://www.quora.com/I-am-turning-25-this-weekend-I-still-havent-found-a-job-that-I-love-being-an-engineering-graduate-It-feels-like-I-am-good-at-practically-nothing-Am-I-already-a-failure-when-others-my-age-are-successful-by-leaps-and-bounds

15,"Hi there,Studying Masters in Wildlife Institute of India (WII) is a life time experience that very few courses in India can offer in Biology. You would be taught Ecology, techniques used in Wildlife management, Wildlife Health, Conservation biology and other disciplines of Wildlife Science. It would be amazing if you can get through the admission process as it can be challenging.I would also mention that one has to be very passionate and hard working in this field. Also this course is not one of those courses that can land you in a settled job after Masters. Good luck","26,124 followers",Ken Saladin,1.3K,22.2K,104.1M,https://www.quora.com/I-am-turning-25-this-weekend-I-still-havent-found-a-job-that-I-love-being-an-engineering-graduate-It-feels-like-I-am-good-at-practically-nothing-Am-I-already-a-failure-when-others-my-age-are-successful-by-leaps-and-bounds
