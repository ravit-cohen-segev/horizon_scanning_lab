But I have a few thoughts.When you look at your fellow students, what do you see? A competitor for a job? A drinking mate? Someone you fancy? If so, I suggest a reset.You are looking at your future colleagues, employers, and people upon whom your reputation depends. These are the most important people in your life. How you behave toward them, and the impression they have of you, will color every future dealing you have — not just with them, but with their extended network.Therefore, maintain your good character, be outgoing, look out for each other, be dependable. Not only are these excellent virtues in general for a happy and healthy life; they are darned good business practices.Keep generally informed about your areas of current interest, and most importantly, reach further. Discover some way to stretch into related areas that at first blush don’t seem to appeal to you. This keeps your mind active; trust me, there will be many days when you will be working in unfamiliar or boring subjects, and get used to the sensation now.Find people in government to chat with or interview, and find out the bureaucratic details of how the system works on a practical level. What’s the best time to show up with an application? Who are the most helpful staff people? Who are the legislators who are the hard workers? The best tools for conversation of this nature: the phrases “Oh?” and “Really? Tell me more about that!”With regard to assistance to the disadvantaged, try to develop relationships with organizations that are doing the hard work, which is often quite different from who gets the publicity. Find out who shows up at the boring committee meetings; who knows the statistics; who writes the comprehensive reports.Figure out the best journalists to follow. Some will have much better insight than others. Separate the wheat from the chaff.Be open-minded. Look at a story that portrays a particular politician or company as one of the “bad actors.” Make it a point to examine the issue with a view to making the best case you could for that side. This will greatly assist your ability, at a later point, to negotiate or communicate effectively with those with whom your views differ.Be known as a good listener, not a combatant. Certainly a bit of spirited dialogue is fine. But don’t overdo it.Now then, any or all of the above might be complete blather, because as I say, I don’t know your local situation. Find people of real experience and good will, and learn from them.Best of luck.",866 followers,Eric Leow Yu Quan,5.3K,95,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-politics-student-who-is-also-studying-law-create-a-bright-future-for-themselves

Having preconceived notions about his current life based on my past interactions with him, I honestly thought he would have transferred to poly or started to work since Singapore’s cookie-cutter academic system evidently wasn't for him. Imagine my surprise when I saw his credentials “Studying Law in Stanford University” – a prestigious course that only the cream of the crop can enter!I contacted him, asking him how he has been all these years, and expressed my curiosity at how he managed to cope with academics in Junior College despite doing poorly in secondary school. After all, you don'tIt turns out that heHe confessed to me that he had this dream of becoming a lawyer from an early age, but never really saw the usefulness of the syllabus he was studying – Singapore is well known for its science-oriented studies instead of the humanities. During his free time in secondary school, he'd spend most of his time reading books on law and legislation, philosophy and making notes on what he had learnt. Showing me his notebook compiling all that he had written, I was awed by a sight of him I've never seen before – diligence. However, once he realized the need for perfect grades as a pre-requisite for his dream course, he placed more focus onto his studies, working diligently to rebuild his weak foundations.It made me realize the bitter truth, thatMy friend, conversely, was lazy becausePeople are lazy when they don't prioritize what they are doing. They procrastinate, do other things they are more interested in, and only come back to the task when it becomes urgent, or they finally see a need to get it done. My friend only saw law studies as his priority early on, but after realizing the need for stellar grades, began placing his other subjects as top priority.

Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a bicep curl like movement to lift something?The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and stamina so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life.Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns.By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape would do (That, in a nutshell, is my answer to this question.I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not compliant robots.",43 followers,Michael Fu,5.4K,126,3.7M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-politics-student-who-is-also-studying-law-create-a-bright-future-for-themselves

Kept on bugging my super patient doctor, who would just say:To most people that’s not even noticeable. I thought it was just the melanin’s response to light, until a doctor told me otherwise. My son was obsessed with that. He still is, 6 years later. When he was 1, he was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder. By then, I knew for sure he was autistic, regardless of the doctor’s opinion. Besides, as a parent you want them to prove you wrong. You hope you’re wrong and they are right. He couldn’t sit unsupported, couldn’t eat solid foods, was still gazing in the distance, laughing a lot to himself, for no obvious reason, walking, if you can call it that, on his knees, obsessed with road signs, posters, only playing with sensory toys and flapping his hands a lot, when exited. He was otherwise, the best baby. Always sleeping through the night, always happy and really sociable. He was diagnosed with autism, a couple of weeks before he turned two. There are several signs of autism in babies, which any online search would show. However, autism is such a wide spectrum, is really hard to tell, especially at such young ages. One thing I know for sure, parents’ instincts, are hardly ever wrong. For me, the first sign was his obsession with my eyes. As you can imagine, it’s not something one can find on a list of signs.

14,"It depends on their age and, of course, the severity of the autism.

It’s not because I’m self-centered, but it’s because it’s my area of expertise. I tend to speak a lot about myself and about my interests, since it’s the best contribution I can have to a particular subject.

It’s not because I’m self-centered, but it’s because it’s my area of expertise. I tend to speak a lot about myself and about my interests, since it’s the best contribution I can have to a particular subject. There may be other reasons why we tend to speak about ourselves when asked general questions, but that’s what my reason is.Now, I just gave a second sign: I explain things and I don’t assume that, just because something happens to me, everyone else is the same. We don’t generalize things very easily. We tend to speak in particulars. We often say from where we have the information that we are providing you. It’s a part of being very precise in what we say.I think it also has to do with the pleasure we get from information. We like our facts. We memorize things for fun. It’s like we collect specific types of information. And, just like collectors, we know where we found this or that piece. We remember how we understood it and all kinds of little details around the process of finding our little collection pieces.I have no issues understanding similes and using them. I just did. It’s a bit more difficult with metaphors. There’s always a feeling of unease around not knowing something clearly. We like to make sure we understand something by verbalizing what we understood.We also give more details than are usually necessary. In our minds, they make perfect sense to a precise understanding. It’s also really hard for us to not finish our points. If you’re speaking with someone on the spectrum and you say you already understood what they are saying, they aren’t going to stop talking. We MUST finish what we start saying, even if we take very long to make our point. If we don’t, it’s unbelievably frustrating.I tend to answer questions very honestly. I avoid lying at all costs and I only lie if it is really important that I lie. I will only lie if there is another moral rule that trumps how much harm the lie will cause.I’ve been asked how come I can be so truthful and not offend people all the time. It’s simple - I usually think the best of people. In the great great majority of cases, I really like people. It’s easy not to offend when you have no reason to. If I don’t like someone, I will not pretend that I like them. But I also don’t think it’s their fault. Sometimes misfits happen between people and it doesn’t mean it’s someone’s fault. It is very very rare that I offend people and, when I do, the reason is usually because I am trying to say something nice and, for some reason, it comes out in a bad way.People cannot tell that I’m on the autism spectrum. But they do notice many peculiar things about me and they often tell me what they notice. I get many comments on how I walk, how I stand, how I act, etc. etc. I’m told that my eyes have a “strong” look, like I seem to scan people. I’m also told that there are certain moments when my eyes are completely child-like - that they light up.Another thing that I’m told is that I look out of place. I have no idea what this means, but I suppose it has to do with the fact that I’ve never felt that I belong to any social group.I think people on the spectrum stand out in some way, but they don’t seem aware of it. I’ve been told many times that I seem to be different than everyone else. People can’t place it. It’s not obviously autism. But I do stand out. One way or another, I am peculiar and I behave in peculiar ways. In the same time, I act normally in my opinion, so I don’t know how and why I stand out. I also never act to attract attention. I don’t like being the center of attention. If someone on the autism spectrum is the center of attention, they will either be unaware of it, or they will look uncomfortable. It’s OK if I’m the center of attention in a situation where it’s normal, such as when I give a speech (and, yes, I can speak in public very easily).Something I’ve noticed about myself when I’m in group photos where people are not posing is that I don’t look in the same direction as everyone else.In awkward social moments, like an uncomfortable silence, I am completely fine. I don’t feel the awkward moments. If no one is speaking, my mind will wonder off somewhere where there’s something interesting. I may seem awkward socially, but I don’t feel it. I’m just me and this is perceived as awkward sometimes. I think this is something you can see in people on the spectrum in general - they are described as awkward or they may know they are, but they don’t really get it right in the moment when it’s happening. I am unaware of myself at any times when I’m not specifically paying attention to myself.I do not talk or act like a robot. Instead, I tend to have goofy ways of acting. I act out everything I say. I often make faces when I speak and I speak with my whole body in a very exaggerated way. Looking pretty is the last thing on my mind.I often burst out laughing. When something is funny to me, I can’t help but to laugh with my whole heart. It’s really hard to contain myself. Sometimes I’m the only person who laughs at something and it’s a little embarrassing. Other times I’m the only person who isn’t laughing and it’s not necessarily because I don’t get it.Here’s a sign that is a great give-away, only you have to be very lucky to notice it: We don’t yawn when someone else yawns. Another person’s yawn doesn’t affect us in any way.We also lack some of the usual body language expressions. Our body language doesn’t tell you very much about how we feel, unless you know the specifics of autistic body language. People often think I feel things I don’t. The most frequent one is that I’m asked if I’m OK when my mind just wondered off. Whenever someone says “today you seem…” it is so seldom anything close to what I’m feeling.Another example is that I wince especially at piercing noises, but I don’t wince because of pain. When I’m in pain, I don’t exhibit pain behavior (which has often made things difficult for me at the doctor). Instead, I exhibit pain behavior at certain sounds, at unpleasant demands of my attention, at textures that I can’t stand. If I’m wearing a fabric that I don’t like, you’d swear someone is torturing me. And it’s not the usual exhibition of discomfort that normal people display, but it’s what would normally be displayed when in pain.Unless I’m busy with my hands, my hands are usually toying with something. I either have an object in my hands, or my hand will touch my face or hair. I don’t like keeping my hands in my pockets and I only do that if it’s really cold. My most sensitive sense is touch and I can’t stand gloves for this reason. The only time I wear gloves is when I’m skiing. I normally prefer being cold or in pain than experience something that bothers my senses.I refer to different parts of me in third person. I will say “my mind thinks…” “my hands play…” I will never say “I hurt my leg” for example. Instead I say “My leg got hurt.”There are other things, but I have to run.

( sorry…about the girls : They are 23 years apart in age; I feel this information is relevant in this answer at some point. )My youngest was such an easy baby!!) And thank God because I was a little older when I had her. ) I later learned that if your baby seems just ,” too easy,” that this is one of the tell tale signs. I really hate answering this question. Due to lack of sleep for almost 5 years () , I feel like I can not communicate past a 4 year old childs comprehension. Lol..My first was also a very easy baby. Just content to sit and take it all in.The youngest, was afraid of everything! Or so I thought. Her senses were very easily over stimulated. Cartoons that most children enjoyed, would scare the hell out of her! But, my oldest was the same way. They preferred more realistic ideas and entertainment. Pretend is not something easily understood in autism. The girls are on different ends of the spectrum. I thought my oldest was just weird and highly intelligent. I thought the baby was just different because she has a different father who is from a different culture. No booing please. I was exposed to something new and was learning. The girls also never had interests in other people. Never. So they became labeled ,”shy and quiet or tranquil.”They always had a blank look on her face. Not in her eyes, just her face. No expression either way. Again, as a shy child would.The baby never grew out of the newborn stage (where the baby is over stimulated and can not calm until they are removed from the situation that is over stimulating. )She was about 4 I guess when I noticed that I didn't have to remove her so she could think, get a clear picture of what all that mess was with all the lights, sounds, 4 different conversations going on, the tv, the dog etc. So there's that sign.They learned things extremely early. Extremely early. Like learning how to read at 2 years 3 months old. You know, because who does that! !!! So yes parents, your child is a little Einstein. Rumor has it that he was autistic. So doing things that they should not even be able to comprehend yet! And it doesn't have to be reading at 2. It could be a number of things of all topics. Because autism is not a disease, it's a phenomenon.Not reaching typical milestones. Because autism is not typical at all. It's way too advanced for scientists to figure out. Their minds are very complex. So while baby girl is reading, she has no interest in toys. Not something to ignore. She doesn't pretend play. I would sit to play with her and show her, there was no playing because the toys can't be out of place. They are lined up in the same order over and over. That was her way of playing. I have always made character voices and played with whatever whenever I could and included baby girl even if she refused, I still talked to her while I played. At almost 5 (in July ), she has started to play with toys. Kids love toys. Autistic kids literally do not know what to do with toys. Because what is the point? There has to be a reason for everything. So, what is the reason for playing? ?? Autistics are very literal. Very. And they have rules that seem cute because they are kids, and they are very cute, but their rules are so much different than my other kids. Remember, I have 5 in between the 2 girls.Baby girl had problems with foods and milk from day 1. I had to make her formula. She would only eat the same foods for 3 (?) years. She choked a lot , crammed her mouth full of food. (That's a sensory thing). And goes back to eating the same thing for years.Routine! I could not even take a new route to town! I had to stay on track or baby girl would act as if she were scared. So, I went to the same places , taking the same route, for 3 years. And it's ok!!!! Don't force crap on these kids. Let them ease into the world. I can now take her anywhere I want, and she does not have meltdowns like I hear about because parents are forcing their kids to do very uncomfortable things. Life is short, let the kid be comfortable.She never slept. For over 3 years. Neither of my girls did. And I have 7 kids. These 2 defined ,”never sleeps”.They never laughed. I mean, when they were little babies (under a year ) and maybe a little past a year old, but not like toddlers do. Not at all. They were both probably 4 years old when they started giggling like toddlers do.My oldest started talking at 9 months old. Again, who??? No one does that. But, my youngest is almost 5 and is just now starting to talk and has to be taught very in depth about speaking and the how's and whys of it all. But she is doing a great job learning and will be fully verbal by 6. Probably sooner. So if your kid isn't talking, it's not always because they are just shy.So look for things that are not coming along as they should or things that are awesome but should not be happening so early in life!And remember, just because one autistic is doing something will not mean the next person is not autistic just because they aren't doing the same exact thing.Sorry this is long and out of order. I'm sure I could list a lot more but I think the idea is understood. (I hope. )I have just reread this post.I would like to add a few things.The love for animals!!! This one is huge in both of my girls. In fact, my 29 year old who is HF autistic, is a surgical vet tech. The baby plays with stuffed animals the way most 6 year old girls play with dolls. She has no interest in dolls.Socializing. It’s very uncomfortable. Some autistic children/ people really don’t want the company of others for many different reasons. Most of the time, I don’t blame them. 😅Learning disabilities. With my girls, age appropriate curriculum was not a problem. The baby is moderately to severe autistic but she knows her letters and about 50 or more site words, math etc. her learning disability is understanding simple commands. Or 2–3 part commands. Do this first that second etc. or even something like look under the bed and you will find your toy. I have to physically show her how to do certain things to be able to honor (?) the command.tooth brushing was too much. It was very uncomfortable.It’s a lot of repetition.Non verbal does not mean that a person can not talk. While my daughter doesn’t speak clearly and didn’t begin to speak much at all until about 5, she is an unclear chatterbox and I love it! Non verbal means she has never come to me and discussed her day or what she saw, did, thinks about something. She has never come to me and said that (???) well, anything that has to do with what happened or how it happened or how she felt. But she will tell me in her own way that she is cold, happy, sad etc. it’s hard to explain. But it definitely does not mean that a child doesn’t speak at all.","2,645 followers",Lisa Daxer,506,2.7K,11.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-politics-student-who-is-also-studying-law-create-a-bright-future-for-themselves

I’m not referring to the natural difficulty some fifteen-year-olds have in making conversation. His was way beyond that.Abiding by accepted social rules was very difficult for him. Considerably before the age of 15, young people understand social rules and, by and large, follow them or risk the fallout from breaking them.I’d worked with quite a number of youngsters on the spectrum. I was accustomed to questions and behavior outside the norm. And, just as there are various levels in any category, there are various levels on the spectrum.There’s a difference between a person who acts out for various reasons or fights social rules out of rebellion. You see, those people are capable of slipping back into abiding by social rules if they choose. People on the spectrum are unaware and therefore lack the ability to choose whether or not to abide by them.He was also bright and creative. A nice young fellow. I like him quite a lot but not everyone can get beyond behavior that is outside the “norm” to see what’s inside the person.","5,342 followers",Anceline Noel,1.6K,222,5.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-politics-student-who-is-also-studying-law-create-a-bright-future-for-themselves

I’m not going to cover everything, but we’ll look at 2 politicians, Adam Schiff and Stephen Miller, so put your politics aside. I picked a conservative and a liberal just to keep things balanced. I have not verified that they’re autistic, but they have some of the traits you might look for. To truly make a diagnosis, one would need to gather information about their private lives. If I had to put money on it, I would say that Miller is the more obvious case, and I’m still on the fence about Schiff. He could go either way.In terms of linguistic evidence, both have a formal, stilted manner of speaking, which is common among people with ASD. They’re often particularly good with words, and I would even say that language is what got these two gentlemen where they are today. One author described Schiff as follows:Friendly, soft-spoken and intense in a studious kind of way, Schiff has a professor’s talent for answering questions in paragraphs of dense and careful argument, at times with such grammatical orderliness that you can almost see the punctuation floating in the air.In Miller’s case, I have noticed an unusually good memory and a penchant for spicing up his sentences with legal statutes. He talks as though he has everything memorized beforehand, and like Schiff, his English is impeccable. In his case I can also clearly identify the “atypical use of language” that’s often mentioned in the literature. Watch an interview and you will see what I mean.Studies suggest that certain facial characteristics consistently turn up among autistic people. Men with autism are rarely square-jawed, brutish types. Look for soft features, especially around the chin and mouth. A prominent cupid’s bow is very common (see image). Pay attention to the philtrum (the groove between the nose and the mouth). Bedroom eyes are common too. I happen to be an Aspie, and I’ve been told that I look hung over all the time (it’s the bedroom eyes). Men on the spectrum are rarely broad-shouldered and muscular. Facial expressions vary, but the stereotype is an expressionless face, and Miller is a textbook example of that. In my own experience, I have noticed that Aspies often have a puzzled expression of mild discomfort on their faces. I have seen it time and time again. I’ll include a second photo of Syd Barrett for that one. Also included in the pictures are Putin (whether it’s true or not, the Pentagon concluded that he has autism), and Julian Assange, who has himself said that he’s autistic. Both of their faces are consistent with autistic people.At first I was skeptical about the Pentagon’s diagnosis of Putin, but then I read the following passage from his famous 2007 “Munich speech.” It couldn’t be a better example of the Aspie attitude towards social pleasantries, which they consider pointless. This quote should be in every book on the subject:“This conference’s structure allows me to avoid excessive politeness and the need to speak in roundabout, pleasant but empty diplomatic terms. This conference’s format will allow me to say what I really think about international security problems. And if my comments seem unduly polemical, pointed or inexact to our colleagues, then I would ask you not to get angry with me. After all, this is only a conference. And I hope that after the first two or three minutes of my speech Mr Teltschik will not turn on the red light over there.”Above all, I am only speculating and providing a few examples for educational purposes. Aspies don’t all look the same.

All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement.Strong FormA good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement.StyleJust as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice.ConventionsConventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such asSupport and ReferencesFinally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources,The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider.

Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.Development of Your ThesisA thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement.Strong FormA good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement.StyleJust as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice.ConventionsConventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such asSupport and ReferencesFinally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources,The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider. Focus on improving your essays’ overall structure—the thesis development, form, style, conventions, and support.

28,"A2A.I am so glad that you asked this question with a tag of “life in general”. Thank you for doing that.I will begin my answer with a small story.When I was selected for Mains, and I had to prepare for the final interview, I went to Officers IAS Academy to give a few mock interviews. My first session there was an orientation session withA2A.I am so glad that you asked this question with a tag of “life in general”. Thank you for doing that.I will begin my answer with a small story.When I was selected for Mains, and I had to prepare for the final interview, I went to Officers IAS Academy to give a few mock interviews. My first session there was an orientation session withThat lesson was lost on me until I faced a mock interview and the panel member asked me about Naxalism. I had very leftist views about it and I kept on talking about socio-economic disparity, how state has failed to deliver even the basic goods. The member was not happy. He kept on saying:“Is that all? Is that all you think there is to it?”It was an uncomfortable interview. It felt like there is some piece that I am missing here. I will tell you in a bit what happened next.Our personality must be in the shape of a continuous learning curve - the sooner we understand that, the better it is. One’s attitude towards things defines everything - literally everything, in one’s life. As I have always said, your mind is your asset, and it directs your attitude. If you see a flower in a football, for example, then no matter how many million people come and tell you what it actually is, you will continue to think it is a flower. Only when you actually go touch it, throw it, feel it, will you be like “Aah, this doesn't feel like a flower after all!”But if you are stubborn(in a wrong way - yes, there is a way of being rightly stubborn), and you refuse to even try the thing - continuously believing it to be a flower - then it says a lot about your personality, doesn't it?I don’t claim to know everything about personality, I am no guru. But there are a few things that I would like to say.

29,"Hi there,I'll tell you my story. Let me know if I'm an average or below average personHi there,I'll tell you my story. Let me know if I'm an average or below average personEdit 1:There were teachers who used to say that I can't do anything big in life. When I got 85% in my 10th my Geog teacher was pretty much surprised. He always used to say that I'm not sharp, active etc. Basically demotivate me. It was fun when my school felicitated me and he was standing there to welcome me. Just a smile, enough, everything was understood.In my college, as I said, I wasn't the most bright person. Was perennially a back bencher and an outstanding student. So when I got placed in Infosys, my departmental staffs, especially my class advisor was surprised. After the declaration of results, she called me to congratulate. She was the one who made me stand out of Practical lab courses for not completing the record book. I still don't understand what good that completing record work brings when all we do is copy from last year book. Okay, that discussion for another day. I've been invited for my college Convocation as a Guest of Honor. The same place from which I graduated in the year 2014 when many doubted that can I pass all the subjects within the 4 year course period.LIFE COMES A FULL CIRCLE.Believe in yourself and work hard. No one knows you better than you and no one can motivate you better than you. You can either take the positivity around you or the negativity around you. I opted for the former.

I had a light breakfast on the day of interview. I was staying in a hotel near green park, which is short distance away form upsc, so commute was not a problem.A friend of mine Dr. Akram Khan (who also appeared for interview) accompanied me to the Dholpur house. A long queue of candidates was in place. Parents and relatives will their moist eyes and high hopes were consoling many aspirants. At 1, the verification began. I bid adieu to my friend and entered the building.The path leads to a square shaped hall. The iconic victorian domes that symbolises so many power centres of modern India is the one that adorn upsc building as well.I was asked to begin with document filing and verification. There were 6 of us in a linear row, unlike previous years, when we sat around a circular table, beneath that circular dome. This was due to COVID guidelines this year. We were done with documentation by 1.30. And then the waiting game began.Since it was afternoon session, I had brought chocolates, cake and fruits. This is unlike last year when my ala carte had lot more :pWaiting there, you exchange glances. Pass smiles. Pressed hard to shed that visible anxiety. Among those I interacted with there, I was the only one already in service, and so, was a little more content than the others. We were given sequences and I was second to be interviewed.At 10, the attendant came to get the first candidate and I secretly heard someone whispering “Sathiyavathi Mam”. She's a retired IAS Officer.Between 1 to 3 PM, I must have gone to the restroom multiple times and checked my tie, hair and shirt crease continuously. The gloves they gave was of poor quality because of which yellowish stains were coming on my hand and my shirt collar as well. I tried to hide it as much as possible.At around 2.50, the attendant came, called for me and made me sit outside the interview room on a chair. I observed the surroundings, the folk paintings, money plants, passing by people, broad pillars, designer tea sets, roasting tea pots. I maintained my calm and kept a warm smile.**Disclaimer, before we start**: The main aim of taking **personality test** is to know the overall **personality** of the candidate and traits of the candidate like their confidence, honesty, intellectual, integrity, understanding ground realities and depth of understanding of various concepts.**This interview may prima facie appear extremely factual and knowledge oriented but it is anything but factual**. Beneath the facts and figures, there is a strong undercurrent of hidden traits that is being assessed as you are answering these questions. **An honest '** I don't know'** here fetch more marks than a dishonest textbook answer. **A warm smile accompanying a mediocre answer fetches more than a serious face accompanying an excellent answer.In short, **it assesses one’s demeanour and not what a candidate says but how they say it. Honesty, Brevity, Coherity, confidence, coolness, balance of views is the key to fetch marks. **Read the answers with the same pointers in mind.Also, my optional was Anthropology and domain specialisation was in the field of Environmental Sciences.Here is the interview transcript with answers that I gave.Upon entering, my initial plan was to greet everyone with “Jai Hind” (being an IPS officer, made more sense) but the moment I entered Mam herself greeted me with “Good afternoon”. So, I replied with “Good afternoon mam” in response :DChairman made me sit comfortably and started reading my DAF around. For around 3–4 minutes they discussed my DAF- my experiences, hobbies, interests, achievements etc. After that the interview began”**Chairman:****Q: How manu services have you filled?**A: Mam, I have filled IAS, IFS and IAAS as well.**Q: Surprised! She asked “Why IAAS when you are already in IPS”**A: Mam, during my initial few months, I saw a lot of fellow probationers getting injuries at National Police Academy due to which many are not able to complete their training also. Mam, I had few minor incidents myself as started fearing whether I will be able to complete my training or not. Since, I had already applied for anther CSE, I filled IAAS as well because just in case I'm not able to complete my IPS training and do not get a very good rank in this attempt to make it to IAS, I will still have a wonderful service to serve the people and stay in the civil services.(She seems satisfied to this answer)**Q. Will you be able to complete your training now? Confident now?**A. Yes Mam, I am hundred percent confident now.**Q: What was your research about?**A. Mam, I studied the butterflies of Delhi and Gwalior. During under graduation, I got a chance to work in NCBS, Bengaluru and got fascinated by butterflies. When I came back to Delhi, I realised that in the last many decades, not a single comprehensive study on butterflies of Delhi has been done and thus I decided to study their spatial and temporal distribution, their population dynamics and effect of landscape heterogeneity on their populations in Delhi.**Q: Where did you publish your papers?**A: Both the papers were based on Delhi study.**Q: Why are butterflies important? **A: Mam, they are excellent ecological indicators and tell us about health of the ecosystem. So, if their population is dwindling, we can get an idea into the overall health of the ecosystem. Second, they are a essential part of the food chain, being eaten by many birds, and control the population of many microorganisms by feeding on them. Lastly, they are one of the most significant pollinators and the ecosystem services extended by them are beyond measure.**Q. Are their Butterfly parks in India? Which is the largest park?**A. Yes, mam. many butterfly parks are there. I don't know which one is the largest one.**Q: What do you write on Quora about?**A. Mam, previously I use to write about environment and climate change issues. But, I've tried my hands on motivational writing, UPSC related answers and general topics as well.**Q: How often do you write on Quora?**A. Mam, earlier I use to write more frequently. However, due to paucity of time at NPA, now I rarely get time to write. Sometimes, I still take out some time on Sundays and try to answer few questions.Thank You, Mam.**Member 1: ****Q. What do you know about Rafale deal? Do we need them? what are the issues that arise?**A. Sir, Rafale deal was a deal between India and France for a purchase of 36 rafale aircrafts.Sir, some issues arose over non-transparency in the way Rafale pricing was done and whether the cost per plane was justified or not. Possibility of corruption in procurement was also there. The honourable SC also gave a judgement on this matter.**A. Yes sir, the aircrafts are state of the art technology and with recent changes in geopolitical situations in the nearby countries- A hostile Pakistan and an aggressive China as our neighbour- coupled with huge shortages of advanced fighter jets in our Air force- makes it imperative that we boost our defence capabilities. Rafale deal was done with an intent to do that. Procurement will certainly boost our national security.**Q**A. **Yes, Sir. I would have certainly done it. However, I would have tried to stay as transparent as possible since the beginning, by putting all the data of the deal in public domain, independent and fair contract policy, and not hide anything. Sir, the planes were procured using public money and we must be accountable to public at all times. Even as the PM of the country.Thank you.**Member 2****A. Sir, these are known to interfere with the navigation of the butterflies. Since birds and butterflies use earth’s magnetism for long distance travel, these radiations interfere with their navigational senses and disturb them. Also, many birds bump Into high rise towers and collapse. Additionally, research has also indicated thinning of egg shells of birds due to the harmful impacts of radiation.**Q. Is it a scienctific theory now or just a hypothesis? Do we have scientific proof in favour of radiation impacting birds and insects?**A. Sir, it has moved beyond a mere hypotheses to a largely agreed scientific reality now. More and more scientific papers over the years have proved that mobile towers does affect animals in negative ways.**Q. What do you think, do you think they are harmed negatively?**A. Yes Sir, as a student of science, I also believe that current findings does suggest that a correlation is there. However Sir, more and more research will help us further narrow down into findings the exact causation also with greater certainty.**Q. Tell me about UN peace keeping force, in which all countries they are currently serving, what is their mandate?**A. Sir, UN peace keeping missions are missions sent to various violence and war ridden countries under the banner of UN. They comprise of people from Army, military and Police forces. India missions are headed by officers from CAPF, Army and several IPS officers have also headed these missions.Sir, I am not sure exactly in which countries they are serving right now, but historically majority of missions have been sent to Middle eastern regions and African countries.Their mandate include minimising violence, restoring peace, minimal use of force, ensuring a sense of peace and security within the region, extending help to the distressed citizens. basically, prevent escalation of violence and act as a neutral peacekeepers under the banner of UN.**Q. What is Indian IPKF mission in Sri Lanka?**A. Sir, IPKF was sent to Sri Lanka to fight the violent Tamil Ealems during the brutal civil war.**Q. Why was there a conflict? Why they turned against India?**A. Sir, it was an ideological battle between local Sri Lankans (Sinhalese) and Tamilians who originally came from India. It was about differential perception of the rights, justice and share of resources both communities received in Sri Lanka.They were against India because they believed that India is meddling in their cause by sending IPKF to Sri Lanka. So, they included India also as one of their adversaries. We, unfortunately lost a PM because of this.**Q. As Indian PM, would you have sent IPKF to Sri Lanka?****A.** Sir, I would have done a greater analysis and weighted all the pros and cons more cautiously before taking such a step. The repercussions of hasty decisions are evident in front of all of us.Thank you.**Member 3:****Q. Why there is a lot of pendency of cases?**A. (I thought he is asking about judicial pendency and start answering that to which the member interrupted)**Q. No, I am asking pendency at the level of investigation in police? what are the reasons for delay?**A. Sir, many reasons are there. First, police have a 60/90 days mandate to complete the investigation. Now, there is a huge shortage of investigating officers, they are understaffed and overburdened, they do not have adequate investigation skills, lack of training and fundings. All these factors push police personal to delay filing of FIR in the first place to avoid that 60/90 days rule and lessen the burden on themselves.**Q. What will you do to improve it?**Ans. Make sure that the 60/90 days rule is not sacrosanct. If there is genuine need of time for completion of investigation, on case to case basis it should be provided to police so they can do quality investigation. Also, skilling of police personal, more investigating officers at the level of Thana, separate investigation fund and separation of law and order police with investigation police (as recommended by honourable SC in Prakash Singh vs UOI in 2006) should be done.**Q. What are the problems of SAARC? **A. Sir, SAARC has many issues. First is the distrust between neighbours. Pakistan’s constant fidgeting with state sponsored terrorism has forced India to weaken its engagement with Pakistan and thus has stalled SAARC as well. Second, the countries trade very little each other. Connectivity is weak and infrastructure is inadequate. Because of all this, India has to ignore SAARC and resort to platforms like SASEC for regional cooperation.**Q. Imagine you are the Indian PM, What would you like to change in SAARC?**A. Sir, I will pressurise to bring Pakistan into the talking table and end the deadlock so SAARC can be revived again. I will push more for creation of infrastructure and connectivity. Push for people to people ties. Increase intra clock trade which is just 5% of their overall trade outside block. Lastly, climate change and environment cooperation will be another major push as all the countries are highly vulnerable to the risk of climate change.**Q. Which one is more important, civil police or armed police? ****A**. Sir, both are important but I believe that civil police is more important than armed police. We have seen this trend in police throughout the world that as a country develops the interference of weapons or armed police in its day to day affairs minimises. Many countries such as Bhutan and Maldives, police personal are not allowed to carry firearms. In such a scenario, the confidence and trust of people in people is maximum and it is an indicator of a peaceful society. So, while India need a mix of both right now, I hope that eventually civil police and not armed police will become the norm.**Q: What is the police ratio in India?**A. Sir, Its around 137 police personal per 1 lakh of population. The target is around 183/er lakh and the UN recommended ratio is 222/per lakh. So, we are around 35% short of our target.Thank you.**Member 4:****Q. Tell me about CCTNS? Benefits of CCTNS?**A. Sir CCTNS is a project to digitise the police services, records and database maintenance. It was launched to integrate all the police stations and minimise use of paperwork in police functioning. Also, to fasten the police work and great coordination at different levels in policing. All the states have been covered under the CCTNS and very few police stations have remained outside as of today.**Q. Plastic pollution, how bad it is? As environment secretary, steps you'll take to improve it? **A. Sir, We dumping over 11 million tons of plastic into oceans each year. Over 80% of plastic is never recycled and lives for over 400 years. Sir, I will take the following steps to control plastic pollution:a. Find out the sources of pollution. The non point sources especially. And try to recycle, reduce, reuse plastic at source itself.b. Incentivise the plastic manufacturers and users to adopt to alternatives or using bio-plastics. Sir, in a free market, consumers and producers will not stop minimising plastic consumption until there are economic nudges to do so.c. Control single use plastics. Over 50% of plastic waste is single use. Better sustainable alternatives can reduce these to a great extent.d. Reduce the menace of micro-plastics. The plastic, once it enters the oceans or waterbodies, disintegrates into micro-plastics which cause the biggest damage to environment and wildlife. Controlling the plastic at source, or minimise dumping which reduce its impact.e. Amend Plastic waste management rules 2016 to make it difficult to dump plastic in open and greater responsibility for all stakeholders.**Q. Tell me about Micro irrigation and vertical farming?**A. Sir, micro farming I'm not able to recollect.Vertical farming is farming done in vertical columns instead of traditional horizontal still based farms. These include vertical columns of soil less columns that contain nutrient rich medium that provide all the necessary ingredients for plants to grow well. These grow plants much faster, has much less environmental impact (less use of pesticide and insecticide) and doesn't require much space. We are using these for urban farming and farming high value crops as this farming is slightly cost intensive.**Q. What is kyoto treaty? What is its current status?**A. Sir, after the UNFCCC conference that was conducted in 1992, it was decided that a comprehensive treaty will be formed to contain global warming. That treaty was Kyoto, launched during UNFCCC conference in 1997. The aim was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by countries in a phase-wise manner. The parties were of two kind- the developed countries had binding reduction obligations while the it was voluntary for developing countries. The treaty was to last till 2020, and from there a more ambitious Paris deal was to take over. However, due to COVID pandemic and non-agreement over some key areas of Paris deal such as climate finance, the Paris treaty is not fully operational yet and Kyoto still remain operational.**Q. First research, then IRTS, then IPS, why IAS now? What is the purpose of your life?**A. Sir, in college I wanted to be researcher. However, I eventually realised that though I liked research, I didn't like the idea of confining myself to the limits of a laboratory. I was a generalist and wanted to know more about the world we live in, and work directly at the ground. This brought me towards Civil Services. Sir, as I got into IRTS and IPS- both of which are excellent services- my quest for diversified experiences and knowledge still remains which can best realised in IAS.Sir, the purpose of my life is to keep learning throughout my life, use that knowledge and experience to bring transformational change at the ground level.Thank You.**Chairman again: **(This question came out of blue. Mam usually doesn't ask any question at the end. And that too this question. Still don't understand the intent behind this question)**Q. If you become IAS this time, where do you think you'll reach by the time you retire?**A. (Took a long pause and smiled): Mam, I think based on my age and service years left, I might reach the level of Secretary to the government of India. I am not sure sure mam. But I hope so.Mam smiled. “Thank you, Your interview is over”“Thank you Mam, Thank you Sirs”I stood up, buttoned my coat, smiled again and left the room.Duration was around 30–35 minutes. Very cordial board. Few questions I can't remember. Please take a moment and upvote so this can reach maximum number of people. Thank you.Thank you for reading this long answer.

Anyways, here’s the memorable pic!!A little background:-Education- B. Sc. (H) Chemistry, Ramjas College, Delhi University and M. Sc. (Chemistry), IIT DelhiWork Experience:- 8 years of experience of working in state run power generation company (Indraprastha Power Generation Company Limited) at Executive position.Hobbies:- Surfing Quora, Watching movies.Home state:- DelhiInterview Board faced:- Ms. Sujata Mehta’s boardAs I entered the UPSC building with other candidates I was told to submit my cellphone, wallet etc., at the counter itself. I was in a rush to grab my seat as I had not seen that day’s newspaper and I wanted to go through it before interview at the UPSC itself. In CSE-2018 interview I was the last candidate to be interviewed in the afternoon session so I had ample time to read newspaper while waiting for my turn. Although it proved to be an unwise decision but god saved me anyhow!!To my surprise, when all of us settled down, I was informed that I shall be the first candidate to be interviewed!!I lost my nerve after hearing this as there were hardly 45–50 minutes to complete the formalities as well as go though the newspaper. I hurriedly finished all the paperwork formalities and grabbed the newspaper I was carrying in my bag. I quickly finished reading it in 30 minutes and was confident that I shall at least not embarrass myself in front of the board due to my little negligence.When my turn came the person asked me to accompany him to the board members' room. I was told to wait outside and entered the room when the bell rang. It must have been a few minutes time but I felt very nervous and tried to calm myself as it was the last round and I had to give my best shot.So the interview started around 10.15 AM and continued till 10.45- 10.50 AM. There were five members in the room.Chairperson:1. Is this your picture (holding my passport size picture in her hand)?2. Please give a brief introduction of yourself mentioning your educational background and work experience?3. When did you take leave from office to prepare for interview?4. What is the nature of your job at IPGCL?5. You seem to use social media and follow Quora. Quora has a bad image of misleading people through fake news. What are your views regarding it?6. There has been a study that even 50% of educated people get mislead by fake news. How do you think we can protect others from getting influenced by fake news?M1:-1. Why have you opted for civil services when you already have a well paying job?2. Do you feel that privatization of DISCOMS has benefitted Delhi?3. Can this privatization model be followed throughout India to improve access to electricity?4. Solar policy in Delhi has seemingly failed. Why?M2:-1. Tell me about the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran?2. What is the reason behind it. Please provide one line answer?3. Do you think that providing electricity subsidy in Delhi is a good decision?4. What is the contribution of revenues from electricity production in Delhi government’s revenues?5. What are your views on Smart City Mission?6. How is fly Ash disposed and used?M3:-1. What is your specialization in Chemistry?2. What do you know about Green Chemistry?3. Which type of green solvents can be used for organic reactions?4. What is Activation energy?5. Why is transition state unstable?M4:-1. What is AGR? Tell me the most recent news regarding it.2. A space scientist from NASA once said that if one sees from space at night time, one can see an entire part of India illuminated. Which region he was talking about?3. What is the difference between LOC and International border?4. What are your views on cyber security situation in India?5. Which is the nodal body for cyber security measures in India?6. Everybody is advising home quarantine for COVID patients. Do you think that it will be a good decision? Are there any issues involved?Chairperson again:1. Vilas do you feel that there are any other areas where you want to be questioned or interviewed?2. But we have already asked questions from that part. So your interview is over.So as everyone can see that the interview went smooth without any cross questions. Perhaps it was due to brief and to the point answers that I gave. I maintained a smiling face throughout the interview. So the wisdom here lies in preparing your DAF from every possible angle.The board was extremely cordial. When I came out, I had a great sense of relief as I knew inside my heart that I had done well and the final marks also proved my expectations right!!PS: - Upvote if you like this. Let this interview experience reach many serious aspirants which will definitely help them to quell their fears regarding the interview process.Regards~VWUpdate 23.01.2021:- Qualified with AIR-10 in CSE-2019 Reserve list announced on 04.01.2021Vilas Wahi's answer to How did your life change after you cleared UPSC CSE?Vilas Wahi's answer to How are the first 24 hours after seeing your name in the final Civil services exam merit list?

So, I put in mI will share my story and the strategy that I followed to clear the coveted Civil Services Exam in the first attempt.First of all, let me tell you a bit about myself. Civil services was never childhood dream.I did my B.Tech from College of Engineering, Trivandrum in Kerala. After graduating in 2015 I was working with ITC Limited, as a mechanical engineer. It was during my stint at ITC that I decided to prepare. So, I put in my papers in the June of 2016 and started preparing from July 2016.Term of preparation:- I started my preps from July 2016 and wrote Prelims in June 2017. So that is a total of 11 months of focused preparation before appearing for CSE 2017.So let me now come to the topic of how to crack civil services in the first attempt.These are some prerequisites that anyone should have before starting their preparation.Should one attend a coaching class to clear Civil Service Exam?This is perhaps the first decision any civil service aspirant will have to make before starting your preparation. Now this is highly subjective. Given the huge amount of online content that is available now-a-days it is perfectly possible to clear the CSE without joining any coaching institute.But I had enrolled at a coaching centre in Kerala. I did so because, at the start of my preparation I had absolutely no idea about the exam or how to prepare for the same. So for me some amount of guidance and handholding was necessary for me.Now I should add a word of caution here. Even if a candidate decides to join some coaching class there is only so much classes can do (at best say 20–30% of the work might get done in a classroom), it will entirely depend on how much effort that you put in that will decide your result.What books should I read?This is again a very subjective topic and there is not a single comprehensive book list that will help you clear this exam.NCERT Text books of history, geography, economics and polity from class Vi to XIIBelow is a list of books that I followed for my preparation.The key here is to select the books you are comfortable with and to stick with them. Reading all the material that comes out daily is both impractical and unfruitful. Reading the same texts multiple times will be much more beneficial.How important is newspaper reading?Newspapers are vital for any preparation strategy. I used to spend atleast 2–3 hours daily reading the newspaper. It helps one cement the concepts and helps you evolve opinions and will help you analyse a given situation from multiple perspectives. This will come in handy especially during mains and interview stages.I used to prepare notes from The Hindu daily on the evernote app. This helped me stay organised. During the last 2 months of prelims preparation, I further reduced my one year worth of newspaper notes into crisp notes that filled one 100 page notebook. I read this condensed version multiple times and was the major source for current affairs preparation for prelims as well as mains.How important is mock exams?Mocks tests are very very very very very important in all the three stages of the exam.For Prelims, giving lot of mock tests will help you refine your strategy to maximise your scoring. For some answering only those questions which they are absolutely sure of will do the trick. Whereas for someone else (like me) maximizing the number of attempts may help clear the cut off. And there is only one way to find out the strategy that will work for you, do umpteen number of mock exams.Perhaps, mock tests for mains are the most important. In mains it is not how much you know that matters, but how well you can articulate the things that you know in the limited time that is available. Mains answer writing is a skill, which can be mastered only with practice.Choosing the right optional subjectThe optional paper can make or break your career. So be very careful in choosing your optional. Your criteria while choosing the optional should bePacing your preparation:-It is of utmost importance to rightly pace your preparation so that you never run out of steam. One must start slowly, but steadily build up momentum so that he/she can give the final push close to the examination.But the most important aspect to clearing this exam is toAll the very best!!",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.6K,360,25.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-if-one-is-autistic

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

Pursuing specialist courses by attending regular offline classes was a bit difficult for most of the working guys. During this pandemic situation, due to the availability of formula certification courses, experienced pros to Upgrad their career with experienced instruction at the comfort of their home.In the area of information science and AI training in Delhi, the big names areNow let me come to the exact question- ‘Which institute is best?’A single institute can't be the answer here. Yes, for particular candidates, the best will be one only, but while answering this question, the best institutes will vary as per the aspirant's needs. For freshers and experienced, the option will vary.Note:- For freshers, it's easier to find the best institute for data science, but for experience, the matter is quite tough. Freshers need generalised data science skill achievement while experienced need more domain-specialised education.What is the thing that you need to look into to analyse the quality of a data science training institute?If you are a working pro with ample experience and searching for a current data science job market-ready course, I would recommend you Learnbay Data science courses. Although this is a Bangalore based data science coaching institute, through their online classes, they earned impressive popularity in Delhi too. Plenty of data science certification courses are available in Delhi, both in an online and offline format, but nothing can be the best other than Learnbay because of the following three courses features.Although you will be opting for online classes the all the sessions will be 100% live and interactive.The key reason why I suggested Learnbay to working personnel is their domain elective learning module and experience-based course segregation.Apart from the generic data science sub-modes like the basics of python, machine learning algorithms, tools like Keras, tensor flow, etc., there are additional elective domain-oriented modules likeThese elective modules train candidates with exclusive domain-specific data handling and machine learning best practices. Although the concepts are the same, the application strategies notably differ from industry to industry. For example, predictive analytics will be more concerned about credit score analysis theories in the Banking domain while the same will concentrate more on customer sentiments in the e-commerce industry. This kind of training is very necessary for experienced candidates.A 1-year experience aspirant will need less domain-specialised practice than a 4 years experienced candidate. Similarly, an 8 years experienced candidate requires to get trained with the leadership aspects of information science. Hence, it's transparent that a single course can't suit all. And even most of the renowned institutes overlook this aspect. At Learnbay, you get a custom-fit package of learning modules, learning assistance, job supports, and project experience. Below are the courses offered by Learnbay.The other learning features you will get through the Learnbay course are as follows:This is all about my recommendations. The criteria for the best course vary from person to person according to their learning needs. And yes, for freshers, Learnbay might not fit well.
