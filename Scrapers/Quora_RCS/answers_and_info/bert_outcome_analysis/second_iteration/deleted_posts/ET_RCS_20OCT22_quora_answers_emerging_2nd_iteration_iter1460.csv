There is an implication that your doctor charges anHowever, I'm wondering whether the truth of this story is that your doctor is charging $20Regardless of which of the above scenarios is true, the answer to the question is a resounding ""No"". It is not the teacher's responsibility to pay your medical expenses. If medical certificates are a requirement of that educational institution or that particular class - and this was stipulated somewhere in their rules and regulations - then it wasWith that answer out of the way, I'd like to address people who, in other answers, have suggested that your doctor charging for medical certificates is a rort.To anyone who believes that doctors should not charge ANYTHING for something as simple as a medical certificate, I would like to point out that doctors who work outside of the hospital system are not on a salary. They do not receive an hourly rate of pay. They do not get 12 weeks of paid holiday per year or get paid the same amount whether they teach classes for an entire 6 hours in a day or just one.Doctors only make money when they have a patient is sitting in front of them in their room. If they sit in their office for 10 hours, and only see 1 patient, then they only get paid for that one patient. There is no income made from phone advice or paperwork done without a patient in the room. If a doctor is sick, or takes a holiday, they get no pay for the time they are away from seeing patients.For this reason it doesn't matter how difficult or easy a medical certificate is for the doctor to do, or whether that amount of work warrants payment or not. The fact is that the time you booked with that doctor could have been utilised by another patient, who had a genuine medical need, whoI guess what I'm saying is that if a doctor has a choice between seeing someone who is happy to pay them for their time, versus someone who feels their medical need is insufficient to require payment, then exactly why would a doctor choose to see the person who wants a free medical certificate?Please remember it is NOT doctors suggesting that people get a medical certificate. They didn't ask you to come in. They didn't advise you to sign up for a class, or job, where that was one of the conditions. YOU signed up for that class and YOU need the medical certificate to meet the class requirements. The doctor will assist you to meet that need but it's not fair to expect them to do it for free. They'd prefer that appointment spot was filled with someone who was happy to pay for their time.Let's move beyond this particular case and look at the real problem that underlies mandatory medical certificates ... which is, they ask doctors to get involved in something that isn't our job, doesn't interest us at all and asks us questions that we're powerless to answer. They ask doctors to engage in a childish game that we're not interested in playing. In short, they're a gigantic waste of time and resources and doctors would love it if you stopped asking us to participate. Thanks!!Doctors provide medical treatment. We try to alleviate symptoms and heal disease. The mandatory requirement for a medical certificate has nothing to do with medical treatment or symptom relief. When a teacher or boss demands a medical certificate they are not doing it to ensure that you receive important medical care. They don't want you to see a doctor just in case you may be suffering with something serious.Instead, they are demanding a medical certificate for one of three reasons ...The first two reasons are the most abhorrent. Their effect is to either encourage people to come to work when sick or they waste doctor's appointments. I'm sure most people are aware of the complaints about how long people need to wait to see a doctor and how much medical care costs your country. Yet employers think it's fine to waste doctor's appointments, and the government's contributions to that doctor's visit, on immature games trying to stop people taking time off work.To people whose employer or teacher requires one of the first two types of medical certificate, the next time you are unwell, have a think about dragging yourself out of bed to see if you can motivate a change in your company/ school policy. March into the boss or teacher's room and cough, vomit, soil yourself and touch as many of their possessions as possible, until they send you home. After all, that's exactly what they are asking you to do to your doctor and their place of business.I personally would never do the following, but, I've often wondered if these mandatory medical certificates actuallyNow ... the third reason - to ensure claims for sickness and special consideration are actually genuine - is more understandable. It's an unfortunate truth that people lie. Students will try to gain an unnecessary advantage over others by lying that they were unwell when they weren't. I do understand that teachers need to be aware of this possibility and strive to ensure that crime never pays.The big problem here is thatDoctors are bound by laws of medical confidentiality and laws surrounding medical certificates.Confidentiality laws mean that a doctor cannot tell you anything about a patient without their express consent. You have no right to know any medical information about your employee or student. Nothing. It's none of your business. Their medical information is confidential and you have no right to ask about their diagnosis or treatment. I know it's frustrating but that's the law. So ... when I complete a medical form I need to tell the patient exactly what I'm writing on the form and they need to agree that it's OK to share that information. If I write something on the form, and the student later becomes unhappy that this information was shared, then they can sue me for breach of confidentiality.This means thatThe best that I can do, when faced with someone I suspect is lying, is to refuse to write a medical certificate for them. I'm not sure if you can imagine what a refused medical certificate looks like, but, that's the BEST you can hope for if a doctor suspects your student isn't genuine. You willNow let's suppose I agree to write a medical certificate. The laws surrounding medical certificates mean that I cannot write something false on a medical certificate. I don't just vouch for your student's story and swear that it's true. If I write a medical certificate that states a student was vomiting at 10am this morning, because that's what they told me, and you see them on TV, at a sporting event, as the little hand reaches the 10, then I can be sued for supplying a false document.So, what can I actually do when caged between these two legal requirements?? I'm being asked to supply a document that contains no lies, but also contains nothing that the patient doesn't want shared. I hope it's not suprising that a lot of medical certificates state things like ""Ms Smith states she was unwell at the time of the exam and has visited me for a medical certificate today"". A doctor has zero interest in getting sued just so your company doesn't lose a day of sick pay, or, you don't have the inconvenience of organising another exam for an absent student.I have no idea how these medical certificates are useful to teachers or employers. In fact, I know they're not. I giggle inside when I hear them complaining about doctor's certificates ... ""And then the same thought always runs through my mind ... ""Let's be clear that it is NOT doctors driving this medical certificate insanity. It is NOT doctors asking people to come and see us for every cough and cold. The demand for medical certificates is driven by people who are either so self-centred that they think wasting medical appointments, and the health care budget of their country, is a reasonable way to reduce their business costs, or, it is people hoping that we will put ourselves at risk of legal action by breaching confidentiality.What's the solution?To employers, please adopt a hiring strategy where you surround yourselves with quality employees that you trust. When these employees are sick please encourage them to isolate themselves at home so as to not spread the illness around your workplace -If you ignore this advice, and choose to hire untrustworthy employees, and you believe they are fradulently claiming sick leave, then please hire a Private Investigator. A doctor is not a Private Investigator. Nor is a doctor a punishment to discourage bad behaviour. If you hire poor employees then look after their poor behaviour yourself.To educators ... as I said at the beginning, I have personally been in communication with the national education body of my country suggesting drastic changes to their medical certificates so that they provide doctors an opportunity to tell you what you want to know. To get useful information out of doctors you need to pose questions in the correct way. Asking us to state that your student was sick is NOT the right way.What this means is that this medical certificate debarcle is out of the hands of doctors. It's up to the people asking for medical certificates to realise their limitations, and waste, and to stop doing it.  What concerns me most is that the worst offenders are our educational institutions. If they're not teaching people how to properly use our limited medical resources then what hope is there?Until next time ... goodbye (again) Quora.",330 followers,Brad Glenn,2.5K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-make-my-teacher-pay-for-a-medical-note-Is-it-normal-for-doctors-to-charge-for-a-medical-note
1,"The situation is probably a bit different in the UK where I work.  Students and staff can both self certify that they are unfit for work for a limited time.  This is to discourage them from going to see the doctor with mild illness such as colds and flu for which there is no actual cure but will get better by itself in a few days. If the doctor is treating you for an illness which makes you unfit for work they will write you a certificate to that effect for free (at the point of need, obviously you are paying for it in general taxation just like any other use of a doctors time ) .

If a student appears to be Ill frequently and we suspect that it is more a case of not wanting to come into school,  we might invite the student and their parents in for a discussion.  If the absence continued and the student was less than 16, with no justification was provided, the parent would likely end up being fined for failing to ensure that the child attended school. If the student was over 16 they would be removed from the courses and withdrawn from the exam. No point in entering students into a public exam that they will not pass due to poor attendance.  It would be a waste of public money.  If you are paying for a private education the same thing would probably occur,  but this time because a selling point for the school will be the good exam grades and they would not want to see the averages mucked up.",0 followers,Paul Bolin,996,1.2K,33M,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-make-my-teacher-pay-for-a-medical-note-Is-it-normal-for-doctors-to-charge-for-a-medical-note

(Queue the Huey Lewis music.)As for your teacher, I completely understand. In fact, depending upon the level of school you're in, it shouldn't be the teacher asking for a note but rather the school. If you're in college, it's a gray area. You'd have to look at the school's policy. Your teacher is more than likely in the right in this case as well.I know it's tough on your end and sympathize, but I would guess that the policy is in place because people abused your teacher's former lack of a policy on the subject. I often have students skip class with a parent's permission but for absolutely no reason. This is often when a parent wants to be their kid's best friend. We're talking students with in excess of 15 absences in a semester, sometimes. I would totally compel them to require a doctor's note (and sometimes bluff them into doing it), but my school has very little control over absences.Bottom line: Your doctor shouldn't, and your teacher won't. Your best policy is to communicate with your teacher.",537 followers,Rahat Monga,11.5K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-make-my-teacher-pay-for-a-medical-note-Is-it-normal-for-doctors-to-charge-for-a-medical-note
