This article will help you to start your preparation.When you are preparing for the Civil Services Examination, you must be aware of exam pattern, syllabus .Indian Administrative Service (IAS) was formerly known as the Imperial Civil Service (ICS) is the Civil Services Examination and one of the toughest competitive exams in India. It is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission for the recruitment of officers for the All India Administrative Civil Service. The only thing constant in today’s world is “change”.

In hypothetical language, these books are the backbone of your preparation.UPSC ask questions based on basic concepts and fact directly or indirectly. NCERT books help Civil services aspirant to get his/her basic concepts clear.The best way to read NCERT books is by assuming yourself a school student. It will help you to relate the things and will make you more comfortable while reading these books. Most of the candidates take it on the ego that I am a graduate and why should I read this 6th class NCERT book. This is a horrible mistake most of the aspirant commit.Now after this all discussion there are few things that you must now about why most of the civil services aspirants fail -While doing preparation, do not do these mistakes.All the best.",98 followers,Suyash Chavan,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Will-you-provide-guidance-for-the-preparation-of-the-Indian-Administrative-Service

Civil services was never childhood dream.I did my B.Tech from College of Engineering, Trivandrum in Kerala. After graduating in 2015 I was working with ITC Limited, as a mechanical engineer. It was during my stint at ITC that I decided to prepare. So, I put in my papers in the June of 2016 and started preparing from July 2016.Term of preparation:- I started my preps from July 2016 and wrote Prelims in June 2017. So that is a total of 11 months of focused preparation before appearing for CSE 2017.So let me now come to the topic of how to crack civil services in the first attempt.These are some prerequisites that anyone should have before starting their preparation.Should one attend a coaching class to clear Civil Service Exam?This is perhaps the first decision any civil service aspirant will have to make before starting your preparation. Now this is highly subjective. Given the huge amount of online content that is available now-a-days it is perfectly possible to clear the CSE without joining any coaching institute.But I had enrolled at a coaching centre in Kerala. I did so because, at the start of my preparation I had absolutely no idea about the exam or how to prepare for the same. So for me some amount of guidance and handholding was necessary for me.Now I should add a word of caution here. Even if a candidate decides to join some coaching class there is only so much classes can do (at best say 20–30% of the work might get done in a classroom), it will entirely depend on how much effort that you put in that will decide your result.What books should I read?This is again a very subjective topic and there is not a single comprehensive book list that will help you clear this exam.NCERT Text books of history, geography, economics and polity from class Vi to XIIBelow is a list of books that I followed for my preparation.The key here is to select the books you are comfortable with and to stick with them. Reading all the material that comes out daily is both impractical and unfruitful. Reading the same texts multiple times will be much more beneficial.How important is newspaper reading?Newspapers are vital for any preparation strategy. I used to spend atleast 2–3 hours daily reading the newspaper. It helps one cement the concepts and helps you evolve opinions and will help you analyse a given situation from multiple perspectives. This will come in handy especially during mains and interview stages.I used to prepare notes from The Hindu daily on the evernote app. This helped me stay organised. During the last 2 months of prelims preparation, I further reduced my one year worth of newspaper notes into crisp notes that filled one 100 page notebook. I read this condensed version multiple times and was the major source for current affairs preparation for prelims as well as mains.How important is mock exams?Mocks tests are very very very very very important in all the three stages of the exam.For Prelims, giving lot of mock tests will help you refine your strategy to maximise your scoring. For some answering only those questions which they are absolutely sure of will do the trick. Whereas for someone else (like me) maximizing the number of attempts may help clear the cut off. And there is only one way to find out the strategy that will work for you, do umpteen number of mock exams.Perhaps, mock tests for mains are the most important. In mains it is not how much you know that matters, but how well you can articulate the things that you know in the limited time that is available. Mains answer writing is a skill, which can be mastered only with practice.Choosing the right optional subjectThe optional paper can make or break your career. So be very careful in choosing your optional. Your criteria while choosing the optional should bePacing your preparation:-It is of utmost importance to rightly pace your preparation so that you never run out of steam. One must start slowly, but steadily build up momentum so that he/she can give the final push close to the examination.But the most important aspect to clearing this exam is toAll the very best!!",10 followers,Ila Tripathi,2.1K,479,23.9M,https://www.quora.com/Will-you-provide-guidance-for-the-preparation-of-the-Indian-Administrative-Service

As an IAS officer, I say with complete knowledge-If the IAS officer is of a senior batch then the IPS has to salute the IAS. Also, as a matter of respect, the IPS will take off his uniform cap only after he is seated.But of course if the batch difference is not too much, there is no need to salute.

In fact Collector Sir, in personal meetings, calls SP sir as “Sir”.On a whole, please understand that civil service is driven by protocols. My husband is my senior in the service and I call him Sir when in the office. Even when traveling in a car there are protocols. The senior most officer sits in the seat diagonal to the driver, the next senior behind the driver's seat and if there is still any other officer, he/she sits in the seat adjacent to the driver (the navigator's seat).The idea to make an officer salute someone is not to make one service look superior over the other. It's a mere protocol. In fact even in IAS we call our senior IPS officers as Sir. No matter what.Civil service is a very prestigious and responsible job. Some rules are mandatory to keep the fraternity in order.I have penned down my struggle, motivation to join the services, and a complete preparation strategy in my book 71 to 51.

Took risks to invest ahead and got enough margins from unexpected places. I also helped professors in all sorts of odds jobs like proofreading books. Enough money flowed for my pocket income :) More importantly, precious business lessons.Another friend of mine and I decided to take this startup further. We had a plan to throw out the likes of NIIT and Aptech. We were passionate about algorithms and thought we would teach the likes of CLRS to other students by borrowing some old Intel 486 computers [old machines that were at throw away prices but enough to teach algorithms & UNIX].Unfortunately, I didn't take this education idea further. I was just 18 and that business could have taught me so much. I got cold feet and was not sure if education is the right market for me. I analyzed way too much and threw away the idea. That is the biggest regret of my life. If I could change just one thing in my life, I would just go back and start it up.In general, we will always regret things that we didn't do, rather than the things we did do & fail. I never regretted about those ventures that didn't work. I'm still proud of NalandaU, Zingfin, TheAgni and Be Limitless. All of them helped thousands of users in various ways, even if it didn't make enough revenues. However, I have no excuse for those ventures where I came close and didn't start.If you are a college student, who has an idea, just do. Just do. Just figure out a way to do it without much investment. Also, be smart enough to get enough marks in exams [essentially startup should take away your entertainment time]. You are more likely to learn from that anything your lecturers could ever teach. And if even if you want jobs, you are more likely to get one if you had founded a business in college.EDIT: Some of you asked about my past ventures.

So let me tell you how I overcame this obstacle.First, let me paint the picture. I was a new single father of 4 young children. (Full custody) And after a year of commuting from PA to my job in DC, I just couldn't do it anymore and I lost my job.So I decided to start my own business. I borrowed from family and I dipped into the modest savings I had. This first business had a nice run (24 months), but after signing a bad deal with a national distributor, the business failed. I was broke and already $100's of thousands in debt to friends, family and vendors.However, I didn't want to quit. So I swallowed my pride, applied for food stamps and low income health insurance for my kids. I then signed a really shitty deal to access the tiny bit of equity I had in my house. I moved my whole family in with my parents and I rented out my house. Between my parents help, $500/month positive cash flow from the rental, a credit card with $6k limit and the government assistance, I was able to live and my children didn't suffer too much.I used the equity in my house to hire a tech firm to build out a prototype of a product idea I had thought of during my first business. (I'm a non-technical founder) I went to our local sheriff's office and asked them if they would be willing to try using the prototype, they said yes. When I ran out of money the prototype was about 40% complete, but the sheriff's office had already made an arrest that they generated from tips delivered through the technology. So, they invited me to present it at their annual conference (I told them I was broke, so they didn't charge me).At the annual conference someone watching my presentation asked me to build a version of the tech for their crime stoppers program. $7,200.I then starting building the tech using the prototype as the base point. At this same time I crossed paths with a friend from college. He was out of work and I asked him to help me. He agreed and he cashed in on a small savings he had and we used that $25k to float us.At the same time all of this was happening I learned of a local program (Ben Franklin Tech Partnership) that just started to help create tech companies in my area. (Rural Pennsylvania). I contacted the program director she interviewed me and invited me in.I was accepted to their program. The first challenge they gave me was build a team, so I found two brilliant developers that were looking to build names for themselves. We worked out a deal and I had a team. With a team in place, I received an investment of $25k through the program.They then gave me challenge number 2, get a real customer. So I went out and showed several of the regional police departments and district attorney's what I was building. One of them saw the vision, and purchased out tech for the entire county (at a heavy discount), but still a low 6 figure deal.(I'm adding this note because it is important. I have a Sass model, the first county deal was 16 customers and I had them prepay for 3 years of subscription at a heavy discount to generate cash up front. When self funding, this is a crucial trick for success. Prepaid subscriptions)From there we received another investment of $75k. (These investments are designed to create jobs, they go toward payroll) We spent a year building version 1.0 and launched that with 16 police agencies in July, 2013.After that, building on one success after another we received another $225k investment and we now have 55 paying customers.There was a lot of struggle here so I don't want you to think it was easy. And I am by no means yet successful, but my technology works and I built it with hard work and sacrifice!! You can do it too as long as you believe in yourself.UPDATEThere have been many ups and downs since I first wrote this answer. Building a company is the hardest thing I have ever done. Harder than being a father, husband and son. The company is on track to hit 200 customers in 5 states by the end of the year. We have reached break-even after 7/8 years and may actually throw off a little profit for the first time in 2020.We have not raised additional money, despite the constant pressure of feeling like that is a bad idea. We have had plenty of people and groups wanting to own a piece of the company, but I just can’t get past the feeling that everyone is just “playing start-up”.I tell early stage people all the time, focus on building a business. The product, the idea, the business plan they want you to write..it all is meaningless if you’re not cashing checks. Find something that creates value that someone else is willing to pay you for, focus on that and everything else will fall into place!",UNKNOWN,Elson D'Souza,684,66,159.9K,https://www.quora.com/Will-you-provide-guidance-for-the-preparation-of-the-Indian-Administrative-Service

Here is what they didn’t see:I was determined to do something of my own and I took the plunge, declining some really high-paying job offers ($150k in the US and Rs. 42 LPA in India).

But what was consistent was:Fast forward today - we gotHere are a few achievements of Cogno AI in the last few years:In between, we faced a bunch of challenges, like I mentioned about my co-founder's exit.In another incident, a random engineer from a reputed technology firm got jealous of our progress and tried to damage our reputation by spreading false information about us on LinkedIn. He claimed that we were an unfriendly company and were mistreating our team members, especially freshers. He wanted to acquire likes on social media and didn’t think twice before throwing bricks on us.We picked up those bricks and created a castle from those bricks.

Fast forward today, I run a multi-million dollar revenue business, with 100+ customers, 150+ team members, which gotHow did it all start?In 2013, when I got a rank 33 in JEE Advanced, I was flooded with queries and messages about preparation strategies, the books I used, the coaching institute I went to, etc. I excitedly replied to each and every message I received, until I burned out. I realized that it was totally not possible for me to talk to each person reaching out to me. So, I searched on Google how I can create a blog where I can write articles about the most standard questions people ask me. I got to know about Blogger. Immediately I created a blog, posting a few articles. This was in June 2013, soon after the JEE results were announced.Fast forward December 2013, the blog started receiving some 50 hits per day. Fairly low. Many students used to post their questions in the comments section of the blog and I used to reply to as many as possible. It was easier for me to interact with the students this way because the questions on a specific post were mostly related to that post.Overtime, more students started visiting the blog and the blog became popular. At its peak, the blog received over 100k page-views per day, becoming the most well-known blog on JEE preparation.During the summer after 2nd year (May 2015), I was interning at a university in Germany. I was quite bored with the internship because it was a proper research internship and I figured out that I am not a research person. So, I spent most of my time working on my blog (apart from improving my competitive programming skills). One common question that many students used to ask me was the books that I used for JEE preparation. When I replied to the query, the immediate response from the student was that they posted an Amazon link of the book and asked if that was the correct version of the book.Viola! I realized that I am helping Amazon in the sale of these books. Was there a way to monetize it? I searched on Google and found out about Amazon Affiliate program where they pay some 10% affiliate fees to people who help them promote their products. I didn’t really want to “promote” anything which I do not wish to endorse. So, all I did was that instead of posting only the names of the books that I used during the JEE preparation, I also posted the Amazon Affiliate link. It was an instant hit and money started flowing in.I started making over Rs. 10k a month. For a 2nd year college student coming from a middle-class background, this was a lot of money. I wrote a few answers about the JEE preparation books on Quora and more money started flowing in. As I wrote more and more content in my blog, the blog became quite popular. Some coaching institutes also reached out to me for a promotion, but I avoided that because I didn’t want to promote anything which I was not aware of.In August 2018, I tried to experiment with another way to monetize the blog - write content for which users will pay to access it. I wrote a long guidebook on “How to get a top 50 rank in JEE?”. I called it a “minibook” and sold it via Instamojo. I priced it extremely cheap - Rs. 99 per copy. It generated more than Rs. 2 lakhs of revenue.Given the popularity of my blog, during the 4th year of college, Magoosh reached out to me. For those who may not be aware, Magoosh is a leading US-based EdTech company that specializes in GRE preparation. They wanted to under JEE preparation segment and so, they saw my blog. One of their Content Marketing Managers reached out to me. I instantly grabbed the opportunity. IAfter the small success with Magoosh, I reached out to another friend of mine who user to run a tutorial website. I asked him if he’d be interested in getting blogs for his platform which can help him grow his reach. He saw my blogs and agreed for some 2 - 3 paid posts after which he will evaluate if it would be worth it for him or not. I wrote some fantastic blogs for him on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Face Recognition, etc. We ended up working together on 25+ blogs. For me, it was useful because he published my name on his website as the author of the blog. So, many other companies started reaching out to me.One company was from Poland, another one from Canada, one from Singapore, and a few from India. All of them wanted articles on Technical topics like Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, App Development, Python, etc. I partnered withSo we learned a bunch of things:This small business helped us earn over Rs. 40 lakhs together. In India, where the college fees at my time was Rs. 1.5 - 2.0 lakhs a year, this was a lot of money! This money helped us build a cushion for starting Cogno AI - my current startup which I started in my final semester of college. When I started Cogno, I didn’t have to worry about the immediate cashflows because I had enough money in my bank to be able to survive without having to ask for money from my parents.Today, Cogno provides solutions to 100+ enterprises including the likes of the State Bank Group, Kotak Group, ICICI Group, HDFC Group, Aditya Birla Group, Bajaj Group, etc. Cogno also employs more than 150 talented team members, many of whom are the sole breadwinners of their family.

A Mass Communication course includes print and electronic media radio, photography, advertisement and public relations, film making and new media. It is therefore, important to study mass communication to obtain comprehensive and advanced education in the field and seek wide career opportunities.WHAT IS MASS COMMUNICATIONAccording to Wikipedia, Mass Comm. means, “the study of how people exchange information through mass media to large segments of the population at the same time.” With the phenomenal and unprecedented explosion of communication technology and media across the world, the study of mass communication has become important and enviable. With technology playing an enormous role in our lives today, professions relating to mass communication increasingly need trained professionals who are quick and competent in their work. Careers in the various branches of mass communication are not only high paying but also provide the person with a great deal of job satisfaction and expression of creativity.Mass Communication courses comprises of six core subjects. These include Journalism, Video Production, Audio Production, Advertising, Event Management and Public Relations. Each of the core subjects is an extensive field in itself with each having masters level courses in both, reputed universities abroad and in India. Journalism is further sub-divided into Print Journalism and Electronic Journalism. In these courses, the student gets to learn the skills of reporting, writing and editing stories and news stories.WHY SHOULD YOU DO MASS COMMUNICATIONThere are several reasons as to why a student should pursue a degree in Mass Communication. Some of them are listed as below:There is no dearth of new possibilitiesProbing for new stories and looking for any shred of truth in them, broadcasting these stories to a large number of people including celebrities and politicians, developing new ideas and concepts for various organizations, designing logos and coming up with catchy taglines for various brand, gathering opinions on social issues and sharing them on pubic platforms, creating films, capturing meaningful photographs, creating taglines for products are all reasons why mass communication is one of the most interesting courses one can study. Any other course can hardly offer the candidate all of the above mentioned opportunities along with many others. This is therefore, one of the biggest reasons as to why a student should pursue mass communication.Practical Exposure and AdventureThis course helps the student to travel to a diverse range of places, helps him explore the world from the new perspective of a journalist or filmmaker and cover different events and stories. It also gives the student the freedom to use their creative skills to their full capacity. There is not any particular way of working in this turf which gives the student the freedom to explore and shape out their style of working. Taking risks, coming up with exciting ideas and influencing people are all integral parts of the world of mass media. A course in Mass Communication helps the student develop abilities of critical thinking, problem solving, conflict resolution, team building, and public speaking.Art and CreativityThis course helps the student develop the skills of thinking on their feet, solving dilemmas, resolving conflicts quickly, working in a team, and public speaking. It is no less than an art, from speaking persuasively, to writing imaginatively; attracting the audience through attractive visuals, inquisitive taglines, tempting words and eye-catchy designs, what makes this field an artist’s delight.Multiple career optionsStudying Communication can help the student succeed professionally. Creating strong oral and written messages, working well with others, managing their image, researching, analyzing and solving problems are key abilities employers look for. As soon as you are sure about your key interest area in Mass media, you can apply for internships in newspapers, magazines, FM channels, Production houses, PR firms etc. and kick-start your career from there; having multiple skills and vast knowledge could help you go really long in this field.IMPORTANCE OF DOING MASS COMMUNICATIONOne of the most important reasons as to why a student should pursue Mass Communication is that it is such a course that will satisfy the soul of a creative person. The study of Mass Communication needs hard work, persistence, focus and interest in creative endeavors. Once the student starts giving in their full efforts to the study of Mass Communication, he will definitely feel like he is taking part in a very noble cause. This is because their thoughts and ideas will impact the society positively and will even have the probable power of bringing about a change.A student should know the importance of studying mass communication right from the UG level. A Mass Communication degree should ideally be taken up right from the under-graduation level. Those media graduates who studied all the cores of Mass Communication at the under-graduation level are often in a better position to decide as to what their specialization will be. It could be filmmaking, journalism and other such similar things. A wide knowledge base helps one as a professional too since everything has links to each other. It is always good to know how an ad agency works even if it is event management that the student is interested in. By the time the student graduates, he will have a fair idea of what it really is that particularly which interests him about Mass Communication.It happens many times that Mass Communication graduates switch lines by taking up something other than the core areas of Mass Communication. An increasing number of students often choose to do an MBA degree in marketing. A degree in Mass Communication is therefore important, especially for these students who choose to go into such fields like Management, building up their own business, teaching and the likes. This course is about communication skills which are very important in today’s world where soft skills play an important role in career growth. All the skills that the student has learnt during their graduation or even post graduation can help them communicate their way to success. In comparison to common degrees, a Mass Communication degree often ends up making the student more professional and smart",51 followers,Priya Bansal,755,708,5.9M,https://www.quora.com/Will-you-provide-guidance-for-the-preparation-of-the-Indian-Administrative-Service

I started with a few questions and, in my first month, ended up getting around $260. I’d translated questions into five languages and on December 7th, on the dot, they paid me.Encouraged by how “neat” things seemed to be, I decided to invest more of my time into the Quora Partner Program. Three or four hours a day finding interesting answers and questions to translate, after a month I ended up with a few thousand questions, earning more or less $80 a day.I didn’t think much of it though, since I’d read a few posts (especially from the Italian community) of people horrified after having had their invitations to the program revoked without any reason at all.Just to have some kind of proof, I took this picture three days ago, since we were approaching the end of the month and I still was not believing in Quora’s moral compass:No surprise, really, when this happened today:They just deleted my Partner tab out of the blue. No explanation. No warning. Nothing. I didn’t break any of the rules or anything. The only rule I broke was that I actually made some money, which apparently goes against Quora’s wishes, and then I got banned.I’m sure they won’t even bother answering the e-mails I sent them asking for an explanation, as they did to many people that had the same happen to them.So, yeah, didn’t make that much money, because it’s all a scam put into practice so that Quora can have people put time into broadening their online presence and generating views for free. The moment you start making some money, they take your questions with a sardonic smile and a f*** you very much and kick you out. :)EDIT: people that are sending me constant messages to say they’re sorry and wanting to know more, thanks but the whole story is as stated here, really. There’s no much to it. They are just shady, dirty people and that’s it. The proof is in the pics.The best thing you can do about it is PLEASE spread this answer to as many people as you can before the shady a-holes delete this answer (as they’ve done to so many before, like the poor Italian guy who worked hard for 1 entire month and made 20k only to be scammed) so they can pretend they are angelic, honorable creatures. Those brackets of Top Partners? All lies. There are people making way more money than 5k a month. They will just never be shown to the masses because Quora always kicks them out first.Please spread the word. People need to know.Thank you.EDIT 2: for people asking even more evidence, here it is -There’s also a really good article on Medium about the whole situation:PS.: I’m not saying I know the stories of all people who got scammed, I’m only saying it seems really shady from Quora to start banning people when they start making real money and then not replying to e-mails or replying with bland, robotic answers and no counter-evidence. Those people didn’t break any of the rules stated on the QPP FAQ and got banned anyway when the company sniffed out that they’d have to pay more than the staged numbers they display to the community on the “Top Earners” thingy. Just disgusting.UPDATE 1 (01/02/2019) : I still haven’t gotten any reply to the e-mails I sent and I still have no clue why they did this. I’ve been thinking and I can only come up with two theories:1 - Some of the questions I translated got reported by someone in any of the five communities I was translating questions to and, as Quora is completely ruled by user rants, some bot banned me (even though I take extreme care to only translate interesting questions already made in the English Quora and that I think will generate interesting discussions in other communities, as well). If that’s the case, it’s completely ridiculous, because I surely shouldn’t be punished for a question that is still circulating in the English Quora, giving the impression that there’s nothing wrong with that question — and thus nothing wrong with translating that question. It’s their mistake if it’s somehow “offensive” and still on the website receiving loads of answers a day, not mine.2 - Their algorithm decided I type too fast (and I really do; impossible being a full-time translator and writer and not having fast fingers) and banned me for translating too many questions a day, which is completely ridiculous since it’s very explicit in the QPP rules that there isWhat I find interesting is that, even though apparently I’m not worthy of being on the Program anymore; even though I don’t deserve to be paid for the work I did, I’m still receiving dozens of notifications an hour of people answering questions I translated, as can be seen below:It’s like they’re saying, “Dude, you suck. But your thousands of questions don’t, so we’re keeping them and getting money from them, but fuck you.”I’m still baffled.UPDATE 2 (01/15/2019): Today I finally received an answer to the several e-mails I’ve been sending Quora. Just to keep it clean with the community, I’m posting pics:As I suspected, they’re trying to blame me for translating questions that have been on the English Quora for years, neglected and available for translation, just because someone ranted about them. As I suspected, some of their bots pointed out suggestions to “improvements” to my questions and, as I didn’t oblige to such suggestions (since it’s not a rule to do soMy reply was as follows:For those who want more details, I encourage you to read the comments down below. I’ve already explained the whole situation in excruciating detail. At this point, I don’t even care if they pay me or not. Actually, if they find the thousands of questions I translated so bad for the website, I think it’d be honourable and fair if they deleted all of them. If they do that: delete the questions exactly as they deleted my partner tab, instead of getting thousands of clicks for free out of my work, I’m okay with it. It will be water under the bridge and I will move on from this. Until then, I’m still as confused as I was two weeks ago.UPDATE 3 (01/16/2019) - So, this happened today:Quora sent me an e-mail apologizing for the injustice committed against me and restored my Partner Tab.I replied with this:All my questions are still there and the money seems to be up to date from the last time I saw it.However, in the e-mail, they again seem blind to the fact that the alleged offensive questions weren’tThere doesn’t seem to be a way to make Quora understand that, logically, in this case, they should (a) kick off a witch hunt to ban questions that are still up on the website and some people might see as offensive or that might go against Quora’s values in any way and (b) punish the person thatWhatever. At least they’ve apologized for something. Am I going to delete this answer now that thingsI don’t trust this company enough just yet. I won’t at least for a few months until they actually pay whatever money I make out of the thousands of questions I translated. On the first Monday of February we will see what happens; see if they decide to screw me over again.If they do what’s right then, I might come back here and apologize for calling the whole Program a scam. Until then, things remain as they are. Empty promises are meaningless and everyone knows it.Also, I feel it’s valid to keep this answer up even if I indeed end up coming back here and taking back what I said about the QPP project being a scam. I think it’s important to leave here this precedent so that people know how big a company can fuck up.So, yeah, for now, this situation is in limbo. We’ll see what happens from now on.Again, thanks to everyone sending me messages of support.UPDATE 4 (02/05/2019) - Yesterday, after all this struggle, they finally paid me.However, as I said previously, I still don’t trust the company enough to reach a final conclusion about this Program’s credibility. Not after all this mess.I’ll probably wait a few months before coming back to this answer and having my final say about the whole thing.","358,201 followers",Sean Kernan,1.6K,5.6K,723.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-best-start-ups-in-India-that-was-founded-by-college-students
