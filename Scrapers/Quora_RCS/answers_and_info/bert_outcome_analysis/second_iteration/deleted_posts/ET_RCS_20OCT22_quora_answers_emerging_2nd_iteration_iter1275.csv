Here's everything you need to know to make online teaching a breeze.Find engaging activities to incorporate into your online classroom.Students' ability to focus and maximize their learning potential is essential for effective online education.

Using videoThere are numerous ways to make your job as an online teacher easier and your classroom more enjoyable. Here's everything you need to know to make online teaching a breeze.Find engaging activities to incorporate into your online classroom.Students' ability to focus and maximize their learning potential is essential for effective online education. A virtual classroom, like any other, must be set up to keep students focused and engaged. Keep in mind that students, regardless of age, have a limited attention span and that this applies to both online and traditional classroom learning. Using video, audio, slides, and live sessions is always good.Involve your studentsThis is a continuation of the previous point. In any educational setting, the ability to keep students' attention is critical. Learning in a setting that isn't a ""traditional"" classroom or school can be challenging at times, but the trick is to find a way to make the subject enjoyable regardless of the setting. You will be a better teacher if you identify your students' interests and connect them to the real world. Engaging students in a hands-on activity rather than simply listening is preferable.Be an effective communicatorTo effectively communicate, you must be able to adapt your style to your audience and recognize body language. Remember that online communication is not the same as classroom communication. As a result, you'll have to adapt and improve your skills. You can also seek resources that teach them how to communicate effectively with both students and parents.Be open to ideas and criticismNothing beats soliciting student input and feedback when determining how to improve your classes. To grow your online tutoring business, you must first identify and meet your students' needs. What are the difficulties they encounter during the learning process? Please make certain that your teaching strategy assists them in resolving these issues on their own. One example is revising a lesson based on student feedback.Be familiar with the school-established curriculumOnline education should complement traditional classroom work. You must be able to adapt the traditional curriculum to online classwork. You'll need to be familiar with the general education system and what your students need to succeed in public exams. This could include reviewing examiner reports and using previous test papers from the appropriate boards.Always be eager to learn and growSet measurable goals for each course and revisit them frequently to monitor your progress. This can help you focus your efforts in the right places. Educators frequently make the erroneous assumption that they do not have to keep up with the latest developments in their field. Keep up with the latest developments in your field of study.Learn basic technical skillsUsing the Internet to teach and educate has been a game changer. Become familiar with the latest online learning tools and technology. It is possible to improve your teaching and deliver online classes more easily using these tools. If you're teaching online, your students are likely already familiar with digital methods and expect them to be used. Keep up with new digital media to pique students' interest and improve their learning experience as an instructor. Here are some online learning & engagement tools to invest in:You must also be proficient in using software programs such as Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), video editing software, etc.Investing in scheduling software will make your online teaching experience smooth. It allows you to plan sessions and deadlines, generate invoices and reports, and track student progress. Some include an automatic calendar-based billing system that sends reminders or emails to your students, finance management tools, etc.Workee is designed to help tutoring businesses of all sizes. It combines features such as website builder, booking and scheduling, finance management (invoices and payments), workspace, integration with communication tools (Video Calls), etc.By having all of the tools you need for your online teaching business in one place, you get a simplified and effective platform for running your online teaching business. This saves you time and allows you to focus on what you do best: providing high-quality online education to your students.Explore social media for information and advertisingSocial media is great for both research and communication. Joining communities of professionals dealing with similar issues can help you get support and useful advice and ideas on how to approach various topics. It's also an ideal channel for advertising your online business.",991 followers,Omkar Nawlakhe,12.2K,53,3.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-make-online-teaching-easier-for-you

You can also do an Integrated Ph.D. by aThere are actually three things you can do after you ‘earn’ your Bachelor degree in Physics :1. Continue your studiesAllow me to explain each in detail -1. Continue your studies :-> Here you have several options:a) Pursue Masters's from IIT by cracking IITJAM or from any other university on Physics and earn a Ph.D. later on. You can also do an Integrated Ph.D. by applying and getting a good rank in JEST, TIFR, IISER, etc.b) Pursue your Masters from any IIT (or from any other University) and then pursue MTech by cracking GATE. After MTech, you can get placed in some PSUs or some reputed MNCs. Many prefer higher studies though (like Ph.D. after Mtech). (P.S - IIT Kharagpur provides Integrated Mtech-PhD for Computer Science and Data Analytics after qualifying in GATE)c) Give an entrance test conducted by a few universities for Btech and get into some good Engineering Colleges. (Ex: Jadavpur University in Kolkata conducts an entrance test for students of BSc(Hons) Physics. Qualified Candidates enter into 2nd year of BTech. Likewise, Calcutta University provides Btech in Radiophysics.)d) Do Bachelors in Education(BEd) for a Teaching Job.e) MSc in other subjects like Biophysics, RadioPhysics, Geophysics, Instrumentation, etc. Ex - MScTech in Geophysics from ISM Dhanbad (Note: the degree mentions MScTech, not MTech; Both are different).f) Other Masters program in other disciplines if you want to do it like MCA, MBA, MA, LLB, etc. (Being interested in Defence Services, personally I would have preferred Masters from Institute of Defence Studies in Pune and Ph.D. later on— a path very few know or like to tread .)g) If you have a Gap in years after your BSc Physics and possess the thought that you will be unable to share the class with the younger generation, feel free to pursue distance learning through IGNOU. You can pursue your master's in other subjects via IGNOU or sit for an entrance examination for MSc. Physics (distance learning) which by the way IGNOU conducts in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (forms available in the month of September).h) You can also pursue higher studies from foreign universities. Of course, you have to crack the competitive exams related to that purpose.2. Get a Job :→ You can Apply for Various entrance examinations for Banks(RBI Grade B, SBI PO, IBPS, etc), Railways( ASM, Goods Guard, JE, RPF SI, etc), PSUs or State Units(AAI ATC, Electricity Executives, Forest Guard, etc), Armed Forces(AFCAT, CDSE, Coast Guard(only interview) ), Civil Services(UPSC CSE, State CSE, IFoS) and Central/State Police Services( SSC CAPF, UPSC CAPF, SSC CGL, etc). Crack these Examinations and earn a respectable service with the Central or State Governments or Banking Sector or PSUs.(PS: If you have completed MSc Physics then you can apply to the Indian Navy as an Officer or else not. Indian Navy does not recruit candidates having just BSc in Physics. You either should have BTech or do MSc Physics- the condition valid even in UPSC CDSE recruitment)→ If you want a job in your core field(subject), there are exams like ISRO Scientific Assistant, SSC IMD Scientific Assistant, BHAVINI Scientific Assistant, NCPOR Scientific Assistant(which do not conduct any exam but only Personal Interview), NPCIL Scientific Assistant, etc. which too are Govt Organisations that requires Bachelor’s in Physics as a qualification.(PS- If you complete MSc in Physics however you can apply for a relatively higher position in similar organizations for the post of Scientific Officer - Some institutes like BARC do not recruit candidates having a degree less than that of MSc.)You know the craze for Government Jobs, Don’t you? Some Jobs are indeed Earned. :)→ However, You can always find a Job in the Corporate Sector. Ex: TCS, WIPRO, etc.So, All the very Best if getting a Job is your sole Aim.P.S - Build and Develop Skills via sites(also Android App) like Udemy, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, Codecademy, Allison, etc. Trust me sometimes recruiters will be much interested if they learn that you have invested some quality time in having knowledge which can give you an edge over other candidates. Also makes your Resume look quite attractive. Moreover guess what, most courses are totally free of cost.

When this index would be printed, you’d get a 130 miles high stack of paper. Google searches through all these websites in less than half a second. This also shows the importance of SEO, you’re audience will have too find you’re website between this large index of sites.Later, the company wanted to change their name, that’s how the name:Google was born. After all, Google is a misspelling of the word: Googel, the mathematical term for a one with hundred zeros. This name would reflect the company’s mission to make all information accessible too the world. That worked out pretty well, don’t you think?PageRank assigns a value of relevance to every website and determines how important a website is. PageRank is named after the co-founder of Google: Larry Page. SEO ensures you that your website will be considered as important by Google. If you’re website is considered (more) important by Google, you’re website will be higher in the rankings. Nobody on the outside knows exactly how PageRank works, which makes it quite hard to manipulate this system. This is probably the key to success, because this makes that you’ll always get the best results for you!This fact shows how important Google is today. When people can not search for the website that they are looking for, people make less use of the internet.Yahoo didn’t accept this offer. Later, Yahoo wanted to come back to this offer and offered 3 billion in 2002. This time Google didn’t accept the offer. Today Yahoo is much less valuable as Google. I bet they feel pretty stupid right now!Today, Google has 12.2 million followers on Twitter. If you want to stay up-to-date of all the developments in the search engine, you shouldThis means that Google gets millions of searches every day that have never been done before. SEO systems have to keep themselves informed of these new developments in order to remain up-to-date.Because Google offers its search engine in many languages, Google is used around the world. Google translate is also available in all these 80 languages. The last nine languages that have been added are: Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Somali, Zulu, Mongolian, Nepali, Punjabi, and Maori.Google currently earns the most out of SEA (Search Engine Advertising), companies can pay to stand at the top of the search results in the advertising section. SEO will get you higher in the organic results of Google. Research has shown that search engine users go rather to websites at the top of the organic results.It is therefore increasingly important that websites are well represented by smartphones. This year on April 21st Google officially introduced their new algorithm that measured mobile usability, which means that if you think about the smartphone usability, you’ll be higher in the Google rankings.Source-",0 followers,Rahul Shrivastava,9.3K,587,53.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-amazing-facts-related-to-Google
