The test evaluates the four skills of communication in English – Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking. TOEFL scores are accepted by 7,000+ universities and educational institutions in more than 130 countries, as an indicator of English proficiency of prospective students. Additionally, institutions such as government agencies, licensing bodies, businesses, or scholarship programs may require this test.The test is administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS) at huTOEFL stands for Test of English as a Foreign Language.

TOEFL scores are accepted by 7,000+ universities and educational institutions in more than 130 countries, as an indicator of English proficiency of prospective students. Additionally, institutions such as government agencies, licensing bodies, businesses, or scholarship programs may require this test.The test is administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS) at hundreds of locations across the globe. The TOEFL is conducted all year round. In each location it is conducted at least twice or thrice a month. You need to check up the scheduled test date in your city and reserve a seat.The TOEFL is offered in two different testing formats: the Internet Based Test (iBT) and the Paper Based Test (PBT). In India, the iBT format is offered. The iBT version of the TOEFL test is scored on a scale of 0 to 120 points. Most good universities require a minimum score of 100. The following are the details of the various sections along with tips to tackle them.ReadingThe Reading section consists of 3–5 passages, each approximately 700 words in length, followed by questions on the passages. You get twenty minutes per passage. The passages are on academic topics; they are the kind of material that might be found in an undergraduate university textbook. Prior knowledge of the subject under discussion is not necessary to come to the correct answer. For tackling the reading section, it is advisable to superficially skim the passage first and to then move on to the questions, reverting and reading in detail, whenever required.ListeningThe Listening section consists of 6 passages, 3–5 minutes in length and questions about the passages. These passages include 2 student conversations and 4 academic lectures or discussions. A conversation involves 2 speakers, a student and either a professor or a campus service provider. A lecture is a self-contained portion of an academic lecture, which may involve student participation and does not assume specialized background knowledge in the subject area. Each conversation and lecture stimulus is heard only once. Each conversation is associated with 5 questions and each lecture with 6. For the listening section, it is best to take notes which can be referred to while answering the questions.SpeakingThe Speaking section consists of 6 tasks, 2 independent tasks and 4 integrated tasks. In the 2 independent tasks, test takers answer opinion questions on familiar topics. They are evaluated on their ability to speak spontaneously and convey their ideas clearly and coherently. In 2 of the integrated tasks, test takers read a short passage, listen to an academic course lecture or a conversation about campus life and answer a question by combining appropriate information from the text and the talk. In the 2 remaining integrated tasks, test takers listen to an academic course lecture or a conversation about campus life and then respond to a question about what they heard. For each question, there is a stipulated time for preparation and for speaking. The recording device runs according to the timer, hence time management becomes important. In the Speaking section again, it is important to take notes as you listen and to utilize the preparation time in formulating your answer.WritingThe Writing section measures a test taker’s ability to write in an academic setting and consists of 2 tasks, 1 integrated task and 1 independent task. In the integrated task, test takers read a passage on an academic topic and then listen to a speaker discuss the same topic. The test taker will then write a summary about the important points in the listening passage and explain how these relate to the key points of the reading passage. In the independent task, test takers must write an essay that states, explains and supports their opinion on an issue. While writing your essays, it is important to be spontaneous and casual. Keep your sentences short and the language simple yet effective.The best way to score good in TOEFL is to practice hard and improve your concentration. The more you practice, the more you will be able to concentrate. Also remember, TOEFL is not testing your hold on the language but, your basic understanding of the English language.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,544,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-TOEFL-iBT

2,"I admitted the undergraduate students to MIT for 28 years, nearly 10 as Dean of Admissions.  It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.

It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work.And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps.",426 followers,Daniel Grey Myers,14.3K,173,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-eligibility-criteria-to-get-an-admission-for-a-BBA-in-the-colleges-abroad

I’m always available before and after the meeting to talk and help anyone.Once a man asked me if I could sponsor him. before I could say anything, one of the other members chimed in. “ Oh man, you don’t want Robert, he’s a combat boot sponsor!” It surprised me aI normally tell them what meetings I’ll be at.

When I took to this program, I hit the ground running. I worked very hard on the skills it promotes, particularly honesty and listening. I came to understand that communication isnt just physical. Talking and listening is a spiritual exchange. You have to close down your mind, so your spirit is unaffected when you listen. Even in the bar, I was considered a good listener. The truth is, my mind was running a mile a minute. I was figuring out what was wrong with what you were saying. Then I’d figure out the next thing I would say. Once I had done that, I’d just glaze over until you were done talking. After being in the program a while, I realized, the smallest things people said to me, often stopped me from drinking at critical points. I endeavored to listen to every word. At first, any distraction was infuriating. I took it as a personal affront when someone would disturb the meeting. I wouldn’t say anything. It would burn in my mind and double the distraction. In Detroit, meetings are a little different than other places I’ve sat at tables. We divide into smaller tables for discussion. Some of the tables will finish sooner than others. If the departing tables are making too much noise, a member will say, “One meeting” to remind them to keep it down. Not me, I smack my hand on the table. I don’t have to formulate what to say, and it works much faster. I don’t do it a lot, but when I do, there is instantaneous silence. I actually learned it from an old timer that is long since gone. Hanging with the old timers has made me very serious about this program. So far, all the people that have asked me to sponsor them have been new comers. I have attempted to sponsor four people, three of them have ghosted me. One moved, one disappeared , another is around but not taking the program too seriously. The one who stuck is opening two meetings a week.Then there’s those that just want to stick with one meeting, are getting their papers signed, have other people waiting for them outside, come late and leave early, and any or all of the above. To these people, I say, “ Why would you want to do that, we’re friends. You wouldn’t even like me if I was your sponsor.” I’m not being facetious. I’m a friend to anyone who walks through that door. Some I just don’t have the kind of time it would take to sponsor.",0 followers,Katherine Mora,610,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-eligibility-criteria-to-get-an-admission-for-a-BBA-in-the-colleges-abroad

Here are a few habits we might all adopt.According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 42% of Japanese people think India's international impact is mainly positive, with 4% considering it negative.some things that make Japan unique from the rest of the world.Japan, theThe following is a list of things the rest of the world could learn from Japan1.There Are Almost No Homeless People In Tokyo.Given the fact that Tokyo is the most populated metropolis in the world (39.2 million), one would naturally think there would be a high number of homeless people, similar to major metropolises in North America (such as New York and Mexico City).Thankfully this isn’t the case however. Last year, Tokyo hit an all-time low number of homeless people, a surprising 1700 (7500 for all of Japan, as compared with 600,000 for all of the United States).Japan has historically had one of the lowest rates of inequality among developed countries. But where Japan is really surpassing the United States, instead, is in the social safety net it offers its citizens.The Japanese Constitution guarantees its citizens “the right to maintain the minimum standards of wholesome and cultured living.”Another reason for the low number of homeless may come from the strong support system of Japanese families. Though it is a difficult to quantify, the tradition of Japanese families remaining tight knit and supportive of each member is undeniable.2. A spirit of self-renewalEarthquakes, tidal waves, fires and volcanic eruptions have marred the history of Japan, with large scale destruction on each occurrence. Not only did these kill thousands of people, they also brought down great age-old structures likes temples, castles and palaces. While most places in the world would never attempt rebuilding these structures, many ancient temples and shrines around Japan that were previously destroyed, have been rebuilt.Kiyomizudera Temple in Kyoto was destroyed in the 12th century and much of it was damaged due to civil wars. However it stands perched on a hill, giving visitors a bird's eye view of the country's cultural hub. Perhaps it is because of the age-old Buddhist belief that life must go on, and renewing one's self is the only way to survive. It is just amazing to think that the people who endured such hardships were ready to resurrect such large structures, so that they could be enjoyed for generations to come.3. An Organized Approach To Garbage Disposal.Japan stands as an innovator when it comes to waste management and organization.In Tokyo, trash (4. Say Hi To Japan’s High-Tech Indoor Veggie Factories.It’s no secret that man is openly vulnerable to the random and unforgiving fury of mother nature. Droughts, storms, floods, and many other natural events could at any time, and anywhere, wipe out a major agricultural hub.But no worries, Japan came up with a solution to this issue. Japanese plant physiologist Shigeharu Shimamura, along with GE, recently developed a special LED fixture that emits light at wavelengths optimal for indoor plant growth.They allow Shimamura to control the night-and-day cycle and accelerate growth. The systems allows him to grow lettuce full of vitamins and minerals two-and-a-half times faster than an outdoor farm. He is also able to cut discarded produce from 50 percent to just 10 percent of the harvest, compared to a conventional farm. As a result,Furthermore,5. Touchscreen Menus At Upscale Restaurants.While some may argue that the use of touchscreens in restaurants is just another nail in the coffin for social interaction, I believe this idea to be a step forward with regards to efficiency and customer service. How often do you find your waiter/tress too busy to take your order? Or how often is your order taken down wrong to your disappointment?6. Better Vehicle Parking Garages, Because They’re Automated Of Course.Automated (car) parking systemsAn APS provides parking for cars on multiple levels stacked vertically to maximize the number of parking spaces while minimizing land usage.The benefits?:7. Religious harmonyDespite being the frontrunners of technology and coming up with innovative ideas, traditions and religion still influence the daily life of the Japanese. Businessmen pay their respects at the shrines of deities while excited students buy good-luck charms and fortunes foretelling the future.There are temples that stand at every nook and cranny, big or small. What's amazing is the harmony that stands between the two main religions - Buddhism and Shintoism. Complexes have a Buddhist temple and a Shinto shrine, while most Japanese people worship deities of both religions.7. No room for theftDespite the notorious existence of the Yakuza, Japan is quite a safe place, and petty crimes like pickpocketing and theft are virtually non-existent. Primary school children are taught from an early age that if they do come across an object that doesn't belong to them, they should attempt to find the owner, or bring it to the nearest police station. I have seen several shop owners run after customers who might have forgotten their bags while buying something at their store.8. Good mannersManners matter, so smiling, being polite and thanking people is mandatory when asking locals for directions. Being respectful goes a long way and is most welcome in adapting to Japanese culture.Do learn a few phrases in Japanese, as it helps a lot in communicating with people and not coming across as a xenophobic foreigner.9. The train systemIn fact, the best way to travel through the country is by train. All signs are bilingual (English and Japanese) and there are huge signboards mentioning which platform your train arrives at. If you're still lost, there are information counters within close proximity. However, it is best to remember that the trains are best avoided at peak hours (7 am to 10 am) and (6 pm to 8 pm) and that people queue to board. Do not push or shove.10. Lots and lots of masksIn public places, a lot of people wearing medical masks. At first I thought it was strange and that they were a bunch of germaphobes (which is partly true). But the broader reason for this is that the people wearing masks are unwell or have caught a nasty cold and do not wish to pass on their germs to their fellow commuters. It's not because you stink.Jokes apart, I just wish this would catch on in the Delhi metro or the Mumbai local where people do not even bother to use their hands to cover a sneeze. .These are but a few of the amazing advancements playing out in the Land of the Rising Sun. Of course, no country is perfect, and Japan definitely has some things to work out (i.e., nuclear energy plants being built on fault lines…)Needless to say, however, if you have an issue, Japan has your tissue.Be sure to share your thoughts on Japan’s innovations with us in the comment section below!Source:The Holidaze& Google.Thanks For Reading.",9 followers,Lokesh Venkatesan,1.4K,78,199.8K,https://www.quora.com/What-can-India-learn-from-Japan

Go to any village in India, and you will be able to hear a fascinating story from the elders. That’s how unique our country is.Why not accept it first? Sure, the Western influence is unavoidable, but instead of outright rejection of our own style, why not come up with something that has a mix of both?Unabashedly India",3 followers,Ravi Sharma,3.2K,169,4M,https://www.quora.com/What-can-India-learn-from-Japan

That adds the tools so that you can build stuff (= trade and invest) with them.I have been an advisor to investing student groups for about 10 years and I have seen students lose thousands of dollars on the mechanics of actually buying and selling stocks and cryptos.I’ve had students pay $50 a trade on a $500 investmentAvoid stupid losses and spend at least 15 hours learning things.

There will always be another pump, so you can safely ignore this “once in a lifetime deal” for the next one.#2 Relatively Simple WaysThe relatively simple way to make money on cryptocurrencies involves dollar-cost averaging,Jack Dorsey has been doing dollar-cost averaging for years-buying $10,000 a week every week no matter what.You can improve those returns significantly by taking a slightly more structured approach (I’d also not just buy Bitcoin. Personally, I prefer:Those are all platform or DeFi tokens — except for DOGE, which is a meme coin. You should spend time learning about each one. I also like exchange tokens a lot, includingAnd for all the Bitcoin fanatics, I of course own Bitcoin too.The point is, you can learn to do better than Dorsey relatively easily by taking a more structured approach to your trades and by buying more than just Bitcoin.#3 Relatively Low-Risk WaysYou can also buy stable coins and stake those on lending platforms. These are coins that are programmed to hold the value of 1 US Dollar. They include:If you get USDC, for example, you can go to NEXO and (if you do certain things)That beats the pants off a savings bank or US Treasury bill. It’s a little riskier too though. So, read what their legal language says.The highest paying one is UST,Again, do your homework on each of them. Watch tutorials and read the legal fine print.But a 20% APR is an amazing savings rate—and one of the first real use cases for crypto-tokens. It’s nothing like crash-cost averaging—which has 5x -50x returns—but that requires that you believe that cryptocurrencies will ultimately not go out of existence.So, there are zero no-brainers, but there are simple and relatively risk-free ways of making significant returns.Happy Trading!If you found this helpful, you canIf you learned something, hit that UP ARROW and SHARE.",17 followers,Jon Morgan,2K,423,4.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-eligibility-criteria-to-get-an-admission-for-a-BBA-in-the-colleges-abroad

Here are some of the ways that I made money during my college days at IIT Bombay:Content WritingEditThere are so many ways college students can make money. Here are some of the ways that I made money during my college days at IIT Bombay:Content WritingHere is a screenshot from Upwork. There was a large US client that paid via Upwork and was almost 50% of the earnings.If you plan to do Content Writing, focus on the foreign clients because you’d be able to earn in dollars. I had some clients pay me as high as $75 per article of 1000 words.I no longer run this business because I am running my Startup which is doing much better. However, I feel that Content Writing is arguably the easiest way for students to make money. Very few people can write good quality content which is SEO-compliant and easy to read and is grammatically and factually correct. Also, very few people can write well as well as have technical knowledge. So, if you can write good quality content, definitely consider Content writing as an option.Affiliate Marketing via BloggingThat’s when it struck me that if I can put affiliate links to books, I will be able to earn money.

Apart from this, I got a scholarship of Rs. 5 lakhs for getting a top 50 rank in JEE. That totals toMore than just the earnings, I think I learned a lot of things that helped me while building Cogno AI into a multi-million dollar business. Coming from a middle-class family I always had an urge to make more money and being from a Marwadi family, entrepreneurship was the most natural choice.I think students should strike a good balance between studying, skill development, and earning money. Under no circumstances should one compromise one’s learnings and skills at the cost of money-making because the long-term rewards of the learnings of college life could be worth millions of dollars.","7,441 followers",Liya Sah,15K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-a-company-accept-reject-a-request-for-sponsorship-from-a-college-club-society
