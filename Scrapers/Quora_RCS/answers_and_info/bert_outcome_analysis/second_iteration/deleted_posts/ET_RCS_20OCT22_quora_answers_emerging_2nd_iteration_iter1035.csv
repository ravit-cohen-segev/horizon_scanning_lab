I read about this in magazines during the 1980s, and it was reconfirmed in articles I read in a magazine called Asia Scene, a Japanese trade and culture magazine written in English, and published from the 1950s to the early 1970s.They had a government office that would okay products to export, and would do quality control on the products.I went to Japan in the 1980s, and was surprised how shoddy some of the local goods were. Many products sold in Japan weren’t exported. The midrange and better stuff was being exported to the US. Things were being designed for export.Moreover, by the 1980s companies were aggressive at pushing Japanese-language brands into the global market. Already known were brands like Sony, Toyota, and Toshiba. In the 1970s and 1980s, industrial giants like Mitsubishi were putting their brand into the US market. Datsun (which was a Japanese brand) renamed to Nissan. Other companies were Casio, Isuzu, Daihatsu, Sanyo, Nikko. I think the last three were considered low-grade brands in Japan, but had a glow of quality to some people in the US.So, in 30 years, they changed the image of “Made in Japan.” It took government policy and regulation. In the end, the brand of “Made in Japan” was so good that midrange crap-level brands in Japan could seek to do better with their Japanese name, in the US.Then… they offshored most of their production to China and Mexico, like a lot of big companies throughout the world. While quality suffered, I don’t think it suffered that much. It was maybe a decade of headaches in the 1990s.China has adopted a different set of priorities. They make many of the best electronics now, but haven’t made a big push to put Chinese-language brand names into the global market. I can think only of Huawei and Xiaomi.Perhaps Haier would also count. Also, the Taiwan brands could have also been pushed in Chinese, but they didn’t. I know brands like Lenovo, SPT, ZTE, LG, Asus, and Acer are Chinese or Taiwanese, but the brand doesn’t advertise that fact.I think China doesn’t have a strong trade policy or bureau that regulates exports, to require that only high quality goods are exported.That’s my theory.

4,"You’ve really got two questions hidden in one here. First, why do Chinese goods and services generally get labeled as lower-quality than those originating elsewhere? And second, should spending on R&D be expected to alter that perception?First, some groundwork.The cost of all goods and services can be divided into the cost of labor and the cost of materials. It’s well known that China has a massive, inexpensive labor force.

First, why do Chinese goods and services generally get labeled as lower-quality than those originating elsewhere? And second, should spending on R&D be expected to alter that perception?First, some groundwork.The cost of all goods and services can be divided into the cost of labor and the cost of materials. It’s well known that China has a massive, inexpensive labor force. This, combined with today’s very low cost of transporting goods globally, results in China being a hotspot for making stuff that then gets sent all over the world.Now, even though China’s labor market is cheap (compared to Europe or North America), Chinese producers are still under tremendous pressure to continuously decrease the cost of the products they provide. As inexpensive as a Chinese laborer might be, their cost is fairly fixed (i.e., factory management can’t simply decide to cut pay next month to hit a customer’s price requirements). The cost of labor in China is also rising.The relatively inflexible cost of labor in China leaves materials as the only other component that Chinese firms can hope to cut costs on to decrease the output price. Keep in mind that lower-quality goods aren’t necessarily cheaper to produce, but they’re generally cheaper to buy. The higher-quality goods command a premium compared to the lower-quality versions, regardless of whether they cost more or less to produce.So, you want cheaper goods in an environment with relatively fixed labor costs? Buy cheaper materials. The side effect is that you’re going to get lower quality inputs. This goes for the machinery making stuff, too, not just the raw materials. In general, this is why low cost (Chinese, Malaysian, American, German, or otherwise) goods will typically be of inferior quality compared to higher-priced variants (all other things being equal (brand parity, for example))—becauseNow, the question of whether R&D spending will result in a change of perception around the quality of Chinese goods. The simple answer is NO. The Chinese are entirely capable of producing goods of as high a quality as exists anywhere on the planet (as others have pointed out, the iPhone is manufactured in China). As I alluded to earlier, the perception of Chinese goods being of questionable quality is an economics question, not an engineering question.It might be more instructive to ask, “Why does China have a reputation (fair or not) for producing low quality goods?” You’ll find that it has nothing to do with the Chinese ability to produce good stuff.

Absolutely.  Is anyone building them for us?  Absolutely not.There are several very interesting uses for a 128 bit address space; in no particular order, they are:There are bunches of others; they tend to be a little bit more obsure, so just as a random sample (it's not random, but hey, let's not offend someone else who has a use for 128 bits, and who I didn't include in my personal list), let's look at each of these.It's already possible to utilize more that 32 bits of physical memory.  32 bits gets you 4G of addressable RAM; 64 bits gets you more, but it's generally not enough, even though the typically maximum addressable physical memory is down around 56 bits; that leaves you only 8 bits to play with.Right now, address decoders do not have programmable decode masks.  We could get some of the benefits, but not all of them, in a 64 bit processor, with programmable address decode masks and hardware exceptions.The upshot of this is that we can't use the upper 8 bits, since they are part of the virtual address space, if not the physical 56 bit space.  It's likely that someone, someday, is going to jam 57 bits of physical memory into a machine, and then everything would explode if we used those 8 bits anyway.A typical usage would be on modern Intel processors.Modern Intel processors on multiprocessor machines, the memory bus interconnect is effectively a token ring implementation.  Physical RAM can be hung off each CPU, and accessed via any other CPU.In practice, this is a virtual NUMA implementation; but also in practice: most memory is hung off a single CPU package, usually the BSP, and everyone else accesses system memory over the token ring.  There are some server designs, all fairly recent, which buck this trend.Where would the extra (masked, exceptioned) bits come in?Locality designators.  Locality determines speed of access:It'd be useful if we could use some of the bits in the pointer to tag the memory by how expensive it is, so that we could make decisions about which memory to use for a given piece of data, wouldn't it?  Our computers would all get (measured) up to around 11%-18% faster, with no other major changes in software.But we need more bits for that.This is a similar problem to NUMA and its relatives, as previously discussed; however, it may be even more complicated, because instead of just being slower, the memory might beThere are some algorithms which many people have taken to calling by the colorful name ofNot only that, but generally speaking, HSM implies cache migration from slower to faster, but which happens slowly.  So it's a ""call me once, it'll be slow; call me twice, it'll be faster"" designation.Are you just curious, or do you intend to iterate over this data for a reason?  It'd be useful to be able to omit some information, when it's an OK thing to do, based on a time/completeness tradeoff.  Sensitivity to this would vay not just by algorithm, but byBut we need more bits for that.One of the things you do in search, because you can't hold everything in one machine, is hold different parts of the answer space in different machines.  And then you hand off the answer request to another machine.You can do this a lot of ways, and it's been done a lot of ways over the years, including just round-robin dispatch of requests to some server, somewhere, and then, even if it's slow, it gets the data for you.Another way is to use dispatch vectorization in order to handle the request.This is a fancy way to say that you have the search in hand, and then you create a kind of semantic hash, and then you use this to route to a machine (or one of a bunch of machines) to have it answer the request.In practical terms, this means that there's aSo let's treat the entire search engine infrastructure as a ""memory"", and then assign some bits of the pointer to address the item of information we are requesting: we take the semantic hash, and it's the virtual address of the answer we wanted to get in the first place.  Then we just reference it and return the result.But we need more bits for that.I find this particular use massively interesting, personally.Rather than use hardware protection domains to protect data pages from each other, you use the fact that you're only using, say 52 bits worth of physical RAM (that's a heck of a lot of RAM, by the way!  It's a petabyte!  10^15!).What's left over out of 64 bits?  It's 2^12, otherwise known as our old friend, 4K.Briefly, statistical memory protection relies on the fact of the near impossibility of guessing a valid page, and then messing with its contents.  It's called protection not necessarily from a security perspective as well: it includes the idea of how frequently you'd expect a pointer with a random value in it to hit a page that happens to be valid.So say we have a petabyte of memory, more or less, in use in the system, and we run a program that loads a pointer with a random value in it, and then tries to scribble on whatever happens to be in the CPU virtual address space at that point in memory.What are my chances, on a 64 bit system?  1:4096.Now... how fast can I find a page to scribble on, if I'm malicious?  Or to read, if I'm looking for something that I ought not to be looking at, but which happens to be in memory?If I'm allowed to catch exceptions and retry: pretty darn fast.Leading to the joke...An elephant is a mouse with an operating system. -- UnknownBut... what if my virtual address space was 128 bits?  I could use 64 of those bits as a random page location within the virtual address space.What are my chances?  1:18,446,744,073,709,551,616.Now...how fast can I find that page?Pretty much: it's not going to happen.  Ever.And now I can throw away all the protection domain overhead I was previously paying to use, and I get back all my system call overhead, and TLB flushing, and everything else.Statistical memory protection is viable.  So'sIn fact, so's a lot of CS research I can't do today, except in simulation., and even if my results are good, can't deploy, for lack of hardware.Do we need 128 bit virtual address spaces?I'd argue that there's a need for it.","1,135 followers",Wim ten Brink,2.2K,2.2K,5.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Made-in-China-products-still-have-an-image-of-low-quality-worldwide-even-though-Chinas-R-D-spending-keeps-increasing

And so on.Back in the good ole’ days, computers had 16-bit addresses. That means a total of 65536 memory locations (64 kilobytes). That was a lot back, say, in 1980, but not today.So there came 32-bit addresses, and for a while we were doing just fine. In fact, at first, processors that internally handled 32-bit addresses only had, say, 20 or 24 wires to access physical memory. With 20 wires, a total of 1,048,576 bytes (a megabyte) can be addressed. With 24 wires, it goes up to 16 megabytes.Now 16 megabytes was a Big Deal in, say, 1988. But soon, we had computers with hundreds of megabytes of memory, so now processors provided a full set of 32 address wires. This made it possible to access up to 4,096 megabytes (4 gigabytes) of RAM. That was good for a while… but not today.So we need more address bits. Going from 32-bit to 64-bit, that is. But do we really need 64-bit addresses? Not anytime soon. We are not exactly in need of 17,179,869,184 gigabytes of memory. Sure, the total amount of computer RAM in the world is a lot more than that, but individual computers rarely have more than a few dozen gigabytes of RAM even today, in 2019.Processor makers are aware of this, and know that there is no point providing a full set of 64 address wires in modern processors. That’s why a typical Intel processor “only” has 46 such wires, even though it internally treats addresses as 64-bit. Even with 46 wires, a processor can address 65,536 gigabytes, or 64 terabytes of RAM. That is still a lot more than the largest hard disk drive, so we are okay for now.Will we ever need more than 64 address bits, though? Perhaps. Will computers ever have more than 16,777,216 terabytes (that is, 16 exabytes) of memory? Sounds like an outrageous amount of RAM, but it wasn’t that long ago that 16 gigabytes sounded outrageous, too. Yet today, there are smartphones with this much memory. (I am talking about operative memory, not persistent storage.) So yes, I am pretty sure that in the next few decades, barring world wars, killer asteroids, or bioweapons gone berserk, we will have processors capable of addressing more than 16 exabytes of RAM.Will that mean a switch to 128-bit addresses? Now that, I do not know. While bigger addresses offer the ability to more RAM, they also make programs ever so slightly bigger and ever so slightly slower. And there are other ways to address additional memory. In any case, even if 128-bit internal address representations become common, it does not mean that processors will have 128 address wires. After all, a mere 80 address wires already allow accessing more than a million exabytes (that would be a yottabyte) of RAM. And for all I know, by the time this happens, we may have a brand new paradigm in computing.By way of past examples, as recently as 2000 or thereabouts, people were predicting that soon, we’ll have processors running at clock speeds of several ten gigahertz. That didn’t happen. Such processors would have been immensely hard to manufacture and would produce copious quantities of waste heat. Instead, we ended up with processors containing multiple processing cores. Perhaps something similar will happen with memory: Instead of providing one ginormous contiguous address space, future computers may divide up physical memory among a large number of processor cores, effectively creating a miniature computer network on chip. Or maybe instead of having as many addressing wires as there are address bits, address information would be communicated by other means, much like the switch, not too long ago, from the “PATA” parallel interface that was used to access hard disk drives to the serial “SATA” interface employing much fewer wires.For now though, we’re a long way away from exhausting the capabilities offered by 64 address bits. Remember: a typical Intel processor is really only a 46-bit processor, as it has only 46 address wires that can be used to connect the processor to memory.By the way, a full 128-bit address can access 281,474,976,710,656 yottabytes of memory.","5,650 followers",Dan Lenski,1.9K,1.4K,9.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Made-in-China-products-still-have-an-image-of-low-quality-worldwide-even-though-Chinas-R-D-spending-keeps-increasing
