1,The worth of such a degree is mainly to demonstrate that you attended and graduated from a college.

From what I see as a headhunter, the future is most definitely dominated by those who know how to communicate and maneuver people and systems, NONE of which are based on a singular technical skill.Here’s why:#1. TheCuban is a smart man. He’s right.Read this book [ https://www.amazon.com/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717 ] by Daniel Pink. They’re basically arguing the same thing. From what I see as a headhunter, the future is most definitely dominated by those who know how to communicate and maneuver people and systems, NONE of which are based on a singular technical skill.Here’s why:#1. The information age is almost over. Pre-2000s, only a few people in each industry succeeded because of the difficulty to access and leverage knowledge. Massive monopolies formed. However, nowadays, monopolization is hard to achieve because in a click of a button, thousands, nay millions, can read, learn, and absorb the same information PhD students are studying!Startups EVERYDAY are revolutionizing the way business has always been done, stealing hefty market share from the most established of companies. The era of opportunity has never been as ripe. All industries are at risk for massive disruption.What does this mean?#2. If you focus too much on technical knowledge acquisition, you’re opening yourself up to an increased risk of substitution. ANYONE can compete with you, domestic or international labor or machine! In fact, machines can do a BETTER job of researching, analyzing, and disseminating data.To exacerbate this issue, colleges, universities, and academia are progressing slower than industry, thus the majority of students won’t learn relevant skills in the 4–8 years they’re stuck studying. The real world whizzes by while you’re wasting precious time learning case studies from a bygone era. Not to mention, racking up sizable debt!#3. Technical knowledge never sells a product. People skills do. How many awesome products have failed to launch due to poor sales skills? You can have the BEST widget or program or solution. It still won’t sell itself!You need good salespeople, above-average creativity, expansive marketing, and a coordinated plan to sell en masse. Furthermore, your leadership team must be able to retain, motivate, and develop staff. ALL of which are NOT technical skills!The combined prowess of sales ability and people motivation ultimately separate the companies who last and those who fail. To rely too much on a degree to carry you is dangerous and lazy. There is no shortcut to mastering the ability to be a good person; someone others want to hire or eventually work for.What did he study? Does it matter?#4. Liberal arts degrees may teach you important skills technical degrees don’t. Such as: articulation, persuasion, and ability to SELL. Increasingly, the nature of jobs will require heavy personal interaction. Technical jobs will be increasingly automated, but what can’t be automated is the ability to maneuver people to do things. That could apply to a receptionist, a cashier, or a CEO. Your job is still most likely 80% working with people.The ability to excel at people management is intricately linked to language mastery and a deep understanding of psychology. Liberal arts degrees allow people to expand your knowledge and repertoire of communication techniques to make your point effectively, thus get your way.PLEASE READ THIS MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: Liberal arts degrees are awesome however, you don’t NEED an education in it formally to become successful at life. Like me, you may not have a liberal arts degree but employ many of your learns, ideas, and information you gathered from various sources in many areas of liberal arts.To be clear, I believe college is only useful and achievable for a special subset of people whose parents or themselves can actually afford it and need guidance as they matriculate into adulthood. For those who are self-sufficient, mature, know what they want, and already confident, college has little to yield unless you’re 110% sure you want to work in a traditional 9–5 firm that requires college as a rite of passage.Furthermore, you should always consider your unique set of skills instead of taking generic advice. Some people are naturally attuned to the sciences, maths, and technical spaces. You must decide what’s best for your own preferences, strengths, and passions. Only then, can you unleash the power of your own natural competitive advantages.My StoryAs a child, I preferred reading and writing over math and data. As I got older, I was persuaded that soft skills are wishy washy, meaningless, and unworthy of admiration. The only good stuff was scoring 100% on math and science tests. Who cares about English? In my home, technical skills reign supreme.At my parents’ urging, I chose Finance to specialize in, just to realize I hated it! After college, I was at a complete loss as to what career I should pursue. All my internships and interview experiences revealed people that I didn’t admire doing things I had no interest in.Was I bound to forever live a life like theirs? The misery I witnessed from my superiors at my internship burned into my mind. Was I to similarly bear the consequence of choosing a degree I hated?Would I have to rely on finance as the only job I can do just because I studied it?I shuddered at the very thought of becoming a corporate robot, devoid of passion, fun, and happiness, doing meaningless tasks for managers who don’t care, hoping one day my day will come to move up one rank, then another.

Who uses those?Poor Catiline (far right) really wishes he’d studied rhetoric right about now.Well, aside from me right now, and I’m not getting paid for this shit, the elites do. The Liberal Arts education started out as the things that the rich and powerful had taught to their children so that they’d continue being the rich and powerful.And the one thing all these people had in common was that they didn’t have day jobs. At least, they didn’t have day jobs in the way we’d think of them. These were politicians, nobility and clergy. People who came from wealth, who had connections, who would be taken care of no matter what they occupied their time with.People who could devote their time to reading the Iliad and writing a thesis on it, because they didn’t have to worry about being able to eat.Chart: Which College Degrees Get the Highest Salaries?And when it was only the already wealthy going to university and getting these degrees, that wasn’t an issue. You either didn’t need a job, or you had the sort of connections where you didn’t need to worry about getting one.But in the 21st century we see higher education as being the path to success for the lower classes. And that path only exists if your degree teaches a useful skill.If you look at the above chart, 6 of the top 10 highest paying majors are some form of engineering. Because they have a 1 to 1 relationship with a job. You get the degree, you show up on your first day of work, and you already know what to do. You’re paying for your own training.Technically there’s a liberal arts degree (economics) at #5, but you’re not getting a real humanities until #16 (philosophy). And what kind of job does philosophy prepare you for? What are you gonna do, work at Morgan Stanley pondering the nature of existence?The more applicable your degree is to an actual job, and the greater the difference between supply and demand for that job, the easier it is to get a job with your degree. And Liberal Arts degrees fail on both accounts.There’s no job they prepare you for, and everyone takes them because they’re scared of math.",UNKNOWN,Pallab Roy Chowdhury (GENERAL non Ews),742,355,20.6M,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-criminal-justice-degree-worth-it-if-I-only-want-to-be-a-police-officer-See-you-comments-for-details

5,"My first inclination was to disclaim, ""I'm not top 1%, maybe topMy first inclination was to disclaim, ""I'm not top 1%, maybe topFor further reading, I wrote a couple essays on it:The trajectory of a software engineer... and where it all goes wrong.I'd focus on the second, and if you don't have time to read either, I'll get into the ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the theory (and the 0.0-to-3.0 scale of programmer competence) here. First, programmers tend to separate into three very broad (and overlapping) categories:AddersThese three abstraction levels don't tell the whole story, and of course some ""adder"" tasks are very hard (like building a production trading system) and could not be done by most ""level 1"" programmers. Then there's the altogether different issue of unqualified people being given ""level 2"" (or 3) work, such as architecture of a complex software system. Perhaps a hard L1 task is really 1.3 or 1.5 or even higher. This is just the theory.To assess programmer level and give more of a continuum (from 0.0 to 3.0) we add a decimal point and assume that, e.g., a 2.0 programmer will succeed at 95% of level-2 tasks (and likewise for L1 and L3). At 1.5, it's 50%. At 1.0, it's 5% (relative to L2) and 95% of L1 tasks. In building the model, I assumed a logistic S-curve-- so a 1.6 programmer will succeed at 64% of L2 tasks; 1.7, 76%; 1.8, 85%; 1.9, 91%-- but I don't think it can be taken that precisely.At 0.7, you're able to do most straight coding tasks (although it may take a long time, and you're still not sure what this ""compiler"" thing is really doing). 1.0 is the level at which people are typically considered ""software engineers"" and 1.2 is the probably the median employed engineer, but at top tech companies it's closer to 1.6. A typical SWE 3 at Google is 1.6-1.8 but assigned 1.2-1.4 level work. A typical Sr. SWE at Google is 1.8-2.0 but assigned 1.4-1.7 level work. You might sense a pattern. The bad news is that you'll often be under-leveled at that sort of place. The good news is that the quality of most of the code at Google is quite high. On the other hand, there are plenty of companies (usually non-technical ones that still rely on software) out there that don't have aAll of this might seem like a lot of verbiage, but it's useful in answering the question. The definition of ""top 1%"" depends on whom you include in the ""programmer"" population; I'm looking for something more objective. I'd guess that there are about 200,000 programmers alive at or above the 2.0 level. That's the level I'm going to focus on. (2.5, 3.0, I can't even answer.)

I quickly started rethinking that career decision when I saw that the shop-keeper had to write stuff and add numbers and shit.In the mean time, using computers was easy. Software Engineers work on computers right? Plus, they say it pays well. So, I decided to become a Software Engineer.Growing up in India, nobody told me that Software Engineering is hard. First of all, I didn’t know any Software Engineers. Secondly, everybody who told me that being a Software Engineer is prestigious only had a relative who had another relative who supposedly worked in a Software Company!Since everybody was talking about it and since I happened to love computers, my focus was set.I spent my early teens focusing on Maths, Physics and Chemistry at the expense of English and languages (like Hindi and Sanskrit). I even ignored Biology. By the time I was 17, I got to a point where being a Software Engineer was pretty much my only option.So, I wrote CET, got a decent rank, got into a decent college that accepted me for a course in Information Science and Engineering.There, I struggled. I took 6 years instead of 4 to graduate. My GPA was so low, no company would even interview me in the campus-interviews. So I decided to spend loads of money to try to get a Master’s degree in the US because well, you know, everybody in Software Engineering eventually goes to America right?I got accepted into a Master’s Program in CS. I sailed through it albeit with mediocre grades.By the end of it all, I knew 2 thingsMind you,Yes, yes, I knew that Software Engineers are behind brilliant pieces of work such as Quora and Facebook; but there are millions of Software engineers out there and only a tiny fraction of them do those things.I had no idea what the rest do.Somehow, I got myself recruited into a consulting firm. It was a job where I’d only get paid if I got a contract gig under that consulting firm. Another 6 months later, I finally found my first contract gig.This is where I became a Software EngineerI finally understood what I was building. I found the activity of chugging through thousands of lines of code, trying to figure out why the app behaved the way they did and how to make it behave better, exhilerating.Somebody reports a bug. I then try to do the same thing they did, to make that bug occur again (aka, “reproducing” the bug). Then I find the line of code that’s making it behave that way, change it, watch it change, rinse, repeat and finally fix the bug.This is where I understood the problem-solving nature of being a Software EngineerThen later, somebody said “We need a feature where the app can do this..”. So I googled how to do it but couldn’t find an answer. However, I knew the steps it would take to get it to do that. I could find how to do those steps on Google. Then I put those steps together and viola, my first new feature!This is where I understood that Software Engineers basicallyAs time passed by, I was able to independently fix bugs, implement new features and eventually set up projects from start to finish so other developers could join in.The TL;DR versionFigure out what you want to build.

You do not have to prove yourself.Software is a new field and nobody knows how to do it. If someone says you are unqualified and therefore you must do maintenance work, you should question that person. We have an upside down system where the people who are paid the least do the crappiest work. They tend to be young and naive.This is not an axiom.The narrative that is sold to young engineers by giant companies is the following: ""take your $80k/yr job, do the software maintenance which makes the company $1 million, and hate your life.""""After you have spent enough time in the first tier of the intellectual strip mine, we will make you an SDE 2, where you can do slightly higher level refactoring for $150k a year, which will make the giant company $5 million.""This is what is called an arbitrage.2. You are not a commodity.We have an assembly line mindset left over from the industrial age. Software is more of an artisanship. Don’t believe that you are a replaceable cog. Don’t believe the one-size-fits-all interview process with whiteboarding problems. These serve to grind away your individuality and make you feel like an assembly line worker.3. Software engineering is an art and a science–but rarely both at once.The planning and design process is an art, but once the requirements are in place you can proceed more deterministically. The same is true for the other quantitative activities I have taken part in–4. You are not your job.I learned this very early on playing poker when I had to leave that careerYour job is a means to service your own higher purpose.5. The world is a distributed system.When you take an action on your smartphone, there is latency before that action is ingested.Servers sometimes will lie to you, but servers tend towards eventual consistency. The world works the same way. In the short term, human systems lie to us all the time, but the world tends toward eventual consistency–the truth eventually presents itself.A decent analogy is the efficient market hypothesis: slowly efficient markets are an eventually consistent process.The world is a distributed system–what is the consequence of this? We have to do the arduous risk and reward calculations that are mandatory for every distributed systems programmer.Long-tail failures can and do occur.In a distributed system, we often prioritize safety over liveness. In a distributed operating system, the programmer takes all precaution to avoid data loss. Similarly, if a real life scenario presents a small probability of giant downside risk, you should take huge precaution. If someone offers you to roll a die with 1000 sides, and if you roll a 1-999, you get $100 million, but if you roll a 1000, you get your head chopped off, the upside is capped, but the downside is not.I can estimate how significantly $100 million will improve my life, but it is impossible to quantify how bad it is to get my head chopped off. I would almost never take that offer, because the expected value is infinitely negative.Coming back to the consequences of living in a distributed system, there is a huge range of potential outcomes in a given transaction, and assessing these long tail, massive risks takes a lot of deep thought and calculation.This is aExample: a software engineer might say “I am applying to a job with 1000 applicants, so the chances I will get the job are pretty low.” That is looking at a game of skill as a game of luck, and if you don’t optimize with lots of preparation and sleep for that interview, then it’s your own fault.If you play poker or Magic or Dominion, it is easy to blame a loss on luck, but the best players are the ones who optimize in spite of bad luck. Personally, I like playing games under circumstances when I get unlucky because it makes for more of an interesting challenge and a better learning experience.“Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.”―Luck is an idea that rescues us when we don’t do enough due diligence.We live in a society that loves to talk about luck because it gives us an excuse when we lose. That is not to say that there isn’t luck in the world–There is a long-running philosophical argument about whether or not we control our own fate. In actuality, it doesn’t really matter.We should assume that we are in control of our own fate.If we aren’t in control, it doesn’t change anything7. Choose action over planning.Talk is cheap and execution is scarce.This is why nobody cares about your ideas, they care about seeing your prototype. John Mayer said that all he had to do to become successful isAt Amazon, they called this “bias for action”. At Facebook, they “move fast and break things”.That said, usually you can choose both.8. Software engineering is full of lies and people who will try to take advantage of you.You have to figure out what to believe for yourself.There are also lots of great people, but it is up to you to develop intuition and strong reasoning.There is a scene fromFor example, if you get to a place that gives you lots of perks like free lunch or back massages, understand that they are doing that because they are underpaying you.If you are getting $130k salary, $70k in stock options, free lunch, and free laundry, that may sound like a pretty good deal, but what does that say about how much money the company is making off of you?According toThis isn’t even skewed towards how much they make off ofSoftware economics are unintuitive.What is crazy about software is that it takes $0 to make new copies of a commodity that only has to be written once. This contrasts with the assembly line where each new unit takes new effort and human friction to reproduce. With software, only the first unit takes significant labor to produce.As software engineers, we have to rethink our value as workers in a marketplace with the high leverage of software economics.Giant tech companies can pull off this arbitrage of underpaying engineers because engineers let themselves be seduced into a set of myths.“The intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn’t betray it I’d be ashamed of myself.”-Noam ChomskyThere is a narrative of a programmer who is incapable of doing anything except programming. Some programmers talk about this with pride, saying things like “I am just an engineer, I don’t want to think about the business side of things, I don’t understand the business side of things”.Engineers have been seduced by the industrialist’s perspective that we cannot lead ourselves, we cannot evaluate opportunity cost, and we don’t understand the market as a whole.All of these are lies, and the world will be more efficient and utilitarian if engineers take control of their careers and start evaluating the options outside of their immediate, narrow context.9. You are not your credentials nor your past.If you started in sales, you can learn to become an engineer. If you started as an engineer and don’t like it, you can become a podcaster.You don’t need a degree–if you can do the work, you can get a job as an engineer.In the interview with my brother Michael Rosenthal, he talked about dropping out of school and doing freelance programming, and how he has learned faster since getting out of the highly tracked education process.InDon’t let yourself be defined by your past, and the labels and messaging that society applies to you. You can take control of your life and define your future.10. As a software engineer, you can take career risks aggressively because your downside is fundamentally capped.You should be skipping to work. We spend most of our time at work.The job market isThese are economic fundamentals, not spurious technical signals.Don’t believe the ranting and raving venture capitalists arguing for lower valuations and screaming about a bubble. Don’t believe the luddite anti-technologists who sneer into their lattes.By any logical projection, the high demand for engineers isn’t dissipating any time soon…unless the entire economy collapses in some ghastly black swan catastrophe–in which case your current job will likely vaporize anyway.As",168 followers,Vladimir Katardjiev,2.6K,93,1.1M,https://www.quora.com/Gadjah-Mada-University-Why-cant-we-have-a-simpler-and-more-efficient-bureaucracy-in-UGM
