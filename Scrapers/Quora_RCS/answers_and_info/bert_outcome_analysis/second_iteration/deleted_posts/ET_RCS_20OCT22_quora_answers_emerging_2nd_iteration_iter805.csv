As far as expansion options go, our bodies rate just below a MacBook Air with two broken USB ports. You might be able to get some traction with genetic enhancement, but you need to start that going before a person is even conceived.

Called theThe most amazing photo in science ever taken and the one so hard to believe, is this one:This is a photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2012 of a tiny tiny section of night sky. Called theThe Hubble team did something really cool. Using hard data of how far each galaxy in the above image was from Earth, they created an actual video simulation of what it would look like to fly INTO the galaxies in the Ultra Deep Field image above. Every dot in the video is an entire galaxy of stars passing you by. Here is that video. To really appreciate the Hubble Ultra Deep Field photo, click the video below to fly into that scene: (Note: At the speed of the video, it would take you trillions of years to fly at that speed through these galaxies in real time).Scientists also looked deep into the blackness beyond the above galaxies and asked if there were even more galaxies to see, if the Hubble took an even longer exposure. A few years later, with upgraded camera software, Hubble took an even longer and closer view of the same above spot. Sure enough, called the “In all likelihood, there are even more fainter, more distant galaxies hiding in the above darkness, beyond Hubble’s ability to see.OK, so the sky has lots of galaxies. Surely that is crazy to grasp but perhaps not so hard to believe. Well, to understand better what is so mind-blowing about the above photos, consider this image below:So, just how much of the sky did the Hubble telescope photograph to capture those 10,000 galaxies in one shot?Well, was this some kind of fluke? Perhaps Astronomers pointed the Hubble at a section of sky known to have lots of galaxies. In response, the Hubble took aHere was the result of another such exposure:This one, taken in 2018, is a time-exposure of another tiny part of the sky and found a whopping 15,000 galaxies in a single image. Called theHere was another exposure from yet a third tiny part of the night sky, named simply the “As you can see, it is filled with over 3,000 galaxies (For a final view, this one is a closeup of a cluster of galaxies, one of hundreds known to exist. Most of the objects in it are massive galaxies, clustered together by their mutual gravity. It is called MACS JO717 (In short, everywhere Hubble looked in its dozen+ photos, it saw galaxies of stars … thousands upon thousands of them. No one knew the night sky had that many islands of stars. Every Astronomer on Earth was blown away by the realization that when you look out at the night sky tonight, the darkness you see is not dark. It is FILLED with thousands upon millions upon billions of galaxies of stars, each containing hundreds of billions of suns and possibly trillions of planets of their own. In fact, latest surveys estimate that our visible universe contains overModern computers can draw simulations of what 2 trillion galaxies might look like, if we could see just a tiny fraction of them from a distance. Here is one such simulation (called theEach dot above would be a galaxy of billions of stars positioned by the computer in its correct spot in the night sky. WHOA!To best understand this, choose just one tiny dot in the above image … anywhere. Do it now. Stare at it a bit. Then imagine that dot is our entire Milky Way galaxy.

The three prominent rows show the hairs of the receptor cells that detect very weak vibrations and amplify them so they can be better detected by the cells in the single row which is just visible along the top of the image. These are the cells that send acoustic information to your brain. In any case, all of these cells work together to enable normal hearing sensitivity.Here's a close-up view of the hairs on one hair cell (in a different animal, maybe even a different species, I'm not sure):These hairs are exquisitely sensitive, capable of detecting vibrations that bend them by the width of a single atom! Unsurprisingly, these sensitive structures are fairly easily damaged by exposure to loud sounds. First the close-up view:And now the wider view:The previously orderly arrangement has been massively disrupted. This has a profound impact on hearing, and it's not reversible or treatable. Please, think about your hearing, especially if you're young and can still prevent the sorts of damage that so many young people subject themselves to. Your middle-aged and elderly self will thank you for it. It's easy to overlook the damage in the early years, but by the time you notice hearing problems, you've likely already destroyed more than one-third of your hair cells!Addendum regarding terminology:Although the auditory receptor cells are called “hair cells"" and their projections are described as “hairs”, they are not really made of hair at all. Instead, they are stereocilia, which are similar to microvilli. They contain a rigid crosslinked actin core and are covered by cell membrane.Sources:The wide-view images come fromThe close-up images seem to originally come from theThanks,",UNKNOWN,A.

The human body is a miniature universeOn November 16, 2020, the journal “Frontiers in Physics” published an article called “The research found that the human brain is very similar to the universe. For example, the brain’s water content and the universe’s dark energy both permeate and account for about 75% of each system. When researchers compared the two systems' structural, morphological, network properties and memory capacity, they found the two are strikingly the same.Below, on the left is an image of the brain neural network, and on the right is the large-scale structure of the universe simulated by a supercomputer.Photo 26: The neural structure of the human brain and the simulation of the large-scale structure of the universeImage source: Mark Miller, Brandeis University, of a neuron and connections in the brain (L); Virgo Consortium for Cosmological Supercomputer Simulations, of the large-scale structure of the Universe (R)Isn't the universe fantastic, magical, and captivating? The universe always holds a strange attraction for me.Look into my eyes, and you can see the universe.Love yourself because inside you is a whole universe.Upon writing here, I ask myself,I found a part of the answer in this exciting video:2. Satellite image: Satan's face covers half of the earthThe images of Earth taken from space since 1999 have been atypical.A picture of Earth from NASA in 1999One picture from 1999 shows the image of a demon. Then U.S. President requested copies of the image be immediately forwarded to some of the most influential religious figures in the world.“NASA calls the image a coincidence – but I call it the Devil,” remarked astronomer Richard Gordlum on the picture from 1999. “You might see an elephant in the clouds and call it ‘a coincidence.’ You might see a rabbit and call it ‘a coincidence.’ But you don’t see a 12,000-mile-long image of satanic evil covering half of the planet and call it a coincidence.”Some believe that this picture of Earth taken in 2000 looks like a deformed face.Some believe this picture of Earth taken in 2020 shows a pair of eyes that appear sad and desperate.The universe is still a mystery to humans. The video below will amaze you.3. All galaxies are moving far away from usIn 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that other galaxies were moving away from us, and the more distant the galaxy, the faster the speed.In 1965, scientists discovered the microwave background of the universe and found out that no matter which direction you look or where you make observations, the universe seems to be the same.That makes some scholars hypothesize that the universe is perhaps an expanding sphere, and galaxies are all distributed on the spherical surface.Because it is currently impossible to leave the Milky Way to test this hypothesis, the truth of the universe has always been a mystery for humanity. Are we at the center of the universe, after all? Or is the universe a spherical surface? At the moment, this is a thesis that can neither be proved nor disproved.On November 14, 2013, the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society published a 12-year-long study of massive stars in the Milky Way. The research concluded that the Milky Way has four spiral arms coming out from the center.Image: Artistic image of the Milky Way (top view) (Source: @Image: Panoramic view of the Milky Way by telescope (side view) (Source: ESO/S.

""Every time they tried to screw this to my head, I would slip.""Doctors eventually stabilized her head and her neck muscles regained strength. The halo has since been removed.""It's a miracle that she was able to survive from the actual accident,"" Ghiselli said.

This is extremely important, because it allows the two yellow beams to meet at BS2 indistinguishable and create an interference pattern before hitting the photon detectors. A photon at BS2 comes fromSo while none of the yellow photons ever interacted with the object, they are entangled with the red photons that did and hence carry the information to reconstruct the shape of the cat.This technique makes it possible to illuminate an object with longer wavelength (lower energy, less destructive) and then create an image by detecting in shorter wavelength or a freely chosen wavelength where detectors are available or have superior performance.",1 follower,Huyen Nguyen,4.4K,314,16.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-scientific-photos-are-hard-to-believe-but-are-indeed-real

Once understood from pictures, it can be explained simply, and along with it, waves, thrust, lift, fractals and the Fibonacci sequence. Even if you don't want to learn anything, you will enjoy the pictures. They are amazing due to the patterns they show, and that most were filmed using high- speed cameras.Standing WavesMach DiamondsRaptor Static Fire TestRaptor Engine in FlightMach Diamonds from Fighter JetGas Exiting a Coke Bottle Illuminated by Polarized Light. (You don't need a rocket for Mach diamonds)Guns and BombsGun Fired Underwater (note the spacing of the “bubbles”)Gun Firing (note secondary fire outside muzzle, a Mach Diamond)Nuclear Bomb - note the evenly-spaced clouds above the mushroom cloudFirecracker Eploding Underwater (Mach Diamond when bubble collapses, and pattern of small bubbles above and below).In the two videos above note the explosion then retraction just as it happens for the gun underwater. A beat pattern is created. A standing wave creates a beat. The Falcon Heavy upon launch apparently sounds like making popcorn. The Raptor engine shown in the first picture sounds to me like rapid clicking.Falcon Heavy (note the pattern of bright and darker spots)But maybe you are starting to think I am obsessed with destruction, and so begins the lighter side. These same patterns are seen in less extreme conditions.Popped Water Balloon Falling (pattern in “coil” in water jet)Rope Coil Effect using Honey (same pattern as with balloon. Also, note how the column surges up (thrust))Vortices - Rotating Standing WavesThe last two examples show more of a vortex than an obvious standing wave. But both are standing waves, some just have more rotational effects.Wingtip Vortices in the Direction of Travel (look like galaxies, hurricanes, etc)Wingtip Vortices Viewed from Side (evenly-spaced pattern. Pity wind was blowing)Magnus Effect (perfectly-spaced streams, and vortex)FractalsBullet Hitting Wall (note the pattern and the even spread into evenly-spaced debris)Snowflake Growth Time-Lapse (same standing wave)Fibonacci SequenceFibonacci Sequence Overlayed over Hurricane (vortex)Fibonacci Sequence Overlayed on a GalaxyFibonacci Sequence From Apllication of a Force (note the spacing of and pattern of the cracks in the wood as the chisel moves)Hair Flip From Force (note the pattern in the spacing of the hair)Application of a ForceFibonacci and Fractals (Fibonacci series - 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21. Each number of the series is the sum of the previous two. No rotation.)Nautilus Shell (shell -antinode, space -node, shell, space)Post-it Note Being Removed under Electron Microscope (spacing like the nautilus shell, some curving)ConclusionAll of these phenomena are the result of standing waves. They form a series of nodes and antinodes. This is due to Newton’s third law. The push you exert results in a push back. This results in pressurization (antinodes) and depressurization (nodes) zones.The thrust of a rocket is due to the push back from the exhaust molecules. They do not spread out quicker than the rocket creates it. The exhaust colliding causes a push back. The Mach diamonds are the proof of the standing wave.The coiling and vortices are due to applying a rotational force to a standing wave. Standing waves form in all cases where a force is applied. In the snowflake, growth of the crystal places molecules in places where the forces balance. One molecule pushes another, it pushes back and that is the position they agree on.The Fibonacci sequence results from applying a rotational force, and is a rotating standing wave, or even a rotating fractal if you would like. The reason for the Magnus effect perfectly spacing the streams of water, the fracturing from the bullet, and the snowflakes being spaced evenly is the same in each case. Rotation exerts a specific influence, but a wave is present nonetheless. If you rotate a fractal, you get a vortex.So how do we explain how the Fibonaaci sequence applies in lifeforms? As stated, a rotational force leads to the sequence, so how would a lifeform rotate, especially before birth?Well, there is the Foucault Pendulum.It tells us the Earth is rotating. The reason it can detect the rotation is that there is a delay in its being influenced by being suspended. When we are zygotes, we float in fluids. We rotate because we are suspended in the fluid like Foucault’s pendulum. I wonder if a ball left in still water would turn throughout the day?!Not only that, but like the Moon, we are tidally locked. When the Earth rotates, we also rotate around our own axis, otherwise we would fall every three hours. Our atoms do two rotations for every one Earth rotation, and it is our atoms rotating instead of us.The reason the Fibonacci equation shows up in life is that every atom rotates due to rotation of the Earth, or around the Sun, or through the galaxy, whichever is the bigger influence, but Earth rotation is my pick. But if suspended, the zygote spins also, creating a Magnus effect with the fluid also. Either spin will influence the sequence.The force creating the fractal is the growth of cells. These cells push on the surrounding cells; they push back, creating a standing wave in the form of a fractal. Spin the fractal and we get vortices patterned after the Fibonacci sequence. If there was no rotation, all life would look like fractals.I may sound crazy at the end, but I hope you at least enjoyed the pics, and also learned something.Please share!!!!",51 followers,Jeremy Hughes,3.2K,562,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-scientific-photos-are-hard-to-believe-but-are-indeed-real

44,"The Transit of the moon across Earth, as seen by NASA’s Deep Space Climate Observer (DSCOVR) satellite:This image is often cited by moon hoaxers and other voices of ignorance as “proof” that NASA is nothing but lies, damn lies, and statistics (though I doubt most such folks would get that reference).This is a completely authentic image of Earth and its moon. But what does that actually mean?Even accounting for the fact that the far side of the moon is somewhat darker than the near side, this imageThe Transit of the moon across Earth, as seen by NASA’s Deep Space Climate Observer (DSCOVR) satellite:This image is often cited by moon hoaxers and other voices of ignorance as “proof” that NASA is nothing but lies, damn lies, and statistics (though I doubt most such folks would get that reference).This is a completely authentic image of Earth and its moon. But what does that actually mean?Even accounting for the fact that the far side of the moon is somewhat darker than the near side, this imageAnd there are several reasons for this.The first is the color rendering of the moon.Our brains use the relative strength of the signals from these three receptors to infer the true color of the scene, and they often get it wrong, leading to a whole class of optical illusions—the best known being the distinct bands of color that all normal, healthy humans perceive in a rainbow (rainbows are really continuous).Most cameras are made to mimic the human eye and feed it what it expects. When you photograph a baby or a super model, you aren’t generally interested in analyzing the spectral distribution of her forehead, you just want to capture the sceneThe Earth-moon image in question was captured with the DSCOVR satellite’s EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) which is custom designed to perform spectrographic imaging of the sunlit side of Earth in order to measure climate data. It does NOT take images tuned to human eyes like a smart phone, but instead captures images using ten narrow frequency color sensors from ultra-violet to infrared, each tuned to the study of some elemental part of Earth’s atmosphere, in particular hydrogen, oxygen, and aerosols.By using a computer to render some of these frequencies as the color ranges visible to humans, it’s possible to produce a color image that meets human expectations—after all, the camera was designed specifically to image Earth’s atmosphere.But when you point the instrument at the moon, it finds no hydrogen or oxygen, no aerosols, and in fact nothing but barren minerals that it wasn’t designed to see. No matter how you map the ten sensor frequencies to human-visible colors, the results can never look anything but weird, and the result looks to the human eye like bad CGI from the ‘80s, even through its absolutely authentic.The second reason the image looks odd is calledAs any photographer knows, when you shoot through a telephoto lens, the visual cues used by the brain to estimate distances between objects in the scene become compressed. The brain then must guess relative distances based only on its expectations of relative size, and this can be used to interesting effect:The DSCOVR satellite is roughly a million miles away, looking at Earth through a fairly powerful telescope. It was placed there, in the L1 Lagrangian point, because at that point, the gravitational interaction of the Earth and the sun allow it to sit essentially motionless relative to Earth, imaging the sunlit side of our planet 24x7 for years on end, something that would be essentially impossible otherwise:[Simulation showing the spatial location of the DSCOVR spacecraft, Earth, and the moon, as it would appear to a human out in the L1 point. Credit Scott Manley.]That means if you (and your cellphone) were in a spaceship right beside DSCOVR you’d see something like this (arrow pointing to the Earth and moon):[Earth and it’s moon as the unaided eye would see them from the vantage point of the DSCOVR satellite—only not in eclipse.]The EPIC camera images the Earth through an 11.8-inch (30-centimetre) reflective telescope—which basically flattens the perspective information down to zero (which is fine, it’s not needed for the science.)Finally, the third reason the image looks weird is that it isn’t a single image.EPIC-DSCOVR, like most space imaging cameras, only has a single, monochromatic CCD sensor array. To capture images in one of those ten frequencies, it uses a pair of color wheels which are arranged in front of the sensor to block all but one color at a time.When imaging Earth—the task for which the camera was designed—this isn’t an issue at all. The spacecraft is essentially stationary relative to Earth, and clouds move far too slowly to cause any blur at that distance from one exposure to the next.But when the moon transits in front of the Earth, it’s moving fast enough to create subtle differences from exposure to exposure creating a slightly squashed or smudged appearance.So, like so many scientific images rendered for human consumption by well-meaning scientists seeking to share their work with a world often indifferent to understanding, the EPIC-DSCOVR lunar transit photo is exactly what it claims to be—a completely authentic image of the moon crossing the Earth, shot through a telescope and a scientific imager from the L1 Point, but many people cannot—or will not—believe it.An additional point raised in commentsThe DSCOVR satellite doesn't sit directly on a line drawn between Earth and the sun (that wouldn’t be stable), but orbits that line-drifting anywhere from 4 to 15 degrees off that line over time. The image above was taken near the maximum, which is why both Earth and moon appear just shy of full. They are both illuminated by the sun, about 12 degrees away from the line between the Earth and the camera.[Earth and moon as a human would see them from the vantage point of the DSCOVR spacecraft. Image generated by JPL’s “Eyes on the Solar System” application, using mathematical models of the objects involved—but not on the date the transit was captured, so the sun is in a different position.]An additional pointThat is exactly wrong, but before I prove that, let me point something out. Look at this photograph of the Earth, taken from lunar orbit during the Apollo 8 mission (using a fairly ordinary film camera). Ask yourself, does the Earth look larger, smaller, or the same as the moon does from Earth?Even if you’ve had this pointed out to you before, I’ll bet you a doughnut that if you answer honestly, your answer is “the same.”Why? Because this was taken through a camera lens of unknown (to you) focal length, from an uncertain vantage point, with nothing recognizable in the frame for scale. Unless you’re buddies with a robot named Gort, the only big shiny sphere you’ve ever seen floating in a dark sky is the moon. The above image offers no clues to scale, so when you look at it, your brain figures that’s the moon and scales everything else to match. Now let me paint in the moon to scale:How big’s the Earth look now?Earth’s diameter: 12,742 km. Moon’s diameter: 3,474.2 kmEarth, its moon, and the distance between them drawn to scale:Contrary to one comment below, Earth is actually larger, as compared to the moon, than it appears in the EPIC-DSCOVR transit image, in which the moon is 1/4 the distance closer to the camera than Earth and shot though a 12″ telescope. Long lenses (i.e. telescopes) compress the spacial cues the brain uses to assess size and distance, and make distant objects appear smaller as compared to nearer objects.[Beachgoers with toy car, shot through long lens]","35,116 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,2.3K,12.3K,142.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-scientific-photos-are-hard-to-believe-but-are-indeed-real

The face on mars--The image is captured by viking 1 orbiter of nasa. Scientists become very surprise when they come to know about it. The size of this face is nearly about 18 km. Scientists thought-""Have they found ALIENS."" Really, it is very interesting. Is not?After research, they found that the image which looks like a face was the shadow of a mountain. And the image, when sun was at another direction, is----2). CMB----The given image is of COSMIC MICROWAVES BACKGROUND or CMB.Do you know that this photo is of the universe of nearly 13-14 billions of years ago. This image is captured by Planck satellite of ESA by detecting the microwaves of free vaccum of cosmos.3). Venus scorpian---The image is captured by venera-13 spacecraft of Russia in 1982. But, how is this possible? Venus is hottest planet of our solar system having surface temperature 464 degree celcius and atmospheric pressure is about 96 times larger than the earth. The real fact is that nobody knows what is there.4). Sagittarius A Star----The given image is of the supermassive black hole present at the center of our galaxy milky way named as ‘Seg. A*’.The surprising fact is that, it presents 26000 light years away to us. Means light itself takes 26000 years to reach to us. From such a huge distance, scientists not only detect it but have a photo. This photo is captured by a spacecraft named as NUSTAR.5). Alien skull----The elongated triangular skull is found in Peru. It is called to be an alien skull but the surprising fact is that the skull is also of humans. The skull is from ancient cultures that practiced artificial cranial deformation.6). Ball lighting---Some people saw a different lighting which is very very hot. It is suddenly appears and suddenly disappears. So firstly it is taken as a UFO of any alien. But later, it is found that it is not any UFO. Ball lightning is an unexplained atmospheric electrical phenomenon described as luminescent, spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms, the phenomenon is said to last considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt.Ball lightning - Wikipedia7). Ice on mercury planet---Ice was found on mercury planet,which is so close to the sun. Really, it's very incredible!8). Moon without spots--Moon is tidally locked to the earth. That's why we can see only the side of moon, which remains towards us.We know that this side is full of spots. But, the surprising fact is that the another side of moon is totally clean.The first image of another side of moon is taken by Soviet Union’s Luna 3 spacecraft in October 1959. After research, it is found that the upper crust of this side is 48 km thicker than other.9). First image of black hole--The image is captured by Event Horizon Telescope of NASA. This is the image of black hole of M87 galaxy. It is 55 million light years away from the earth. The image is surprising in itself because it is incredible to capture image from such distance. That black hole is 6.5 billions of times more massive than the sun.10). Picture of ancient stars by Hubble telescope---When we see our night sky, then actually we look at past.For example, the light of sun takes 8 minutes to reach on earth. So when we look at the sun ,we actually look at the sun 8 minutes before than the present time. So, when we look at stars and galaxies which are billions of light years away, then we actually look at the stars and galaxies before billions of years ago than today. Wow!11).The most beautiful structures of cosmos-----YES ! THESE ARE ……NEBULAS. The pictures of most beautiful nebulas are given below.BUTTERFLY NEBULAHEART NEBULACRAB NEBULAEAGLE’S NEBULACAT EYE NEBULAHORSEHEAD NEBULAM2-9 NEBULARING NEBULASATURN NEBULAESKIMO NEBULANGC 7635OWL NEBULAWHEEL NEBULAFLAME NEBULA(12). Liquid water on Jupiter's moon Europa:—The images were captured by Hubble telescope. Europa is fourth largest moon of Jupiter and quite away to sun so that liquid water can't be found there. Scientists concluded that there's a liquid water ocean beneath the surface of Europe that remains warm due to electromagnetic and gravitational forces of Jupiter and other moons.There are many good answers here to this question.

Many will say that it is another man that is trying to play God but these things are plausible. Many still believe that this picture is somehow fake.The shell of a spider-web diatom, Arachnoidiscus sp. – a tiny marine creature – seen in false color through a microscope. It is simply incredible how complex a spider’s web can be when for us it is just a sticky string that is thinner than hair. This is the same reason why some kevlar protection vests are built using spider web.An x-ray of the head of a hammerhead shark. If I wasn't going to say that this is a hammerhead shark, many of you, as I did myself would believe that this is the exoskeleton of some sort of alien.Shockwaves from a USAF T-38C training jet flying at supersonic speeds. I can assure you that even if those lines or effects do look photoshopped, they are not. Our eyes are too slow to catch on shockwaves created by a jet when reaching supersonic speed.Eye of honey bee (Apis mellifera) covered in dandelion pollen at 120x magnification. So complex, yet so simple.An aurora, seen from the ISS on 15 August 2015. The number of beautiful colors and pigments that are offered to our planet to the sun is vast, to the point where earth looks more like an alien planet from a different universe.Blood vessels in the eye of a human. I know that we have already defined most of the functions of human eyes, but they still seem so complex to me as if there is more than meets the eye.Dividing stem cells in the brain.

However, it is neither of these two things. In fact, this is a phenomenon known as Sprites (or Red Sprites)Sprite or Jellyfish lightning occurs only during a thunderstorm, although they’re much higher than the latter (thunderstorms occur in the troposphere). While a thunderstorm is necessary for sprites to occur, they’re not sufficient. In a recent study conducted by scientists, it has been confirmed that the occurrence of plasma irregularities in the ionosphere during a thunderstorm is what causes this to happen. However, what causes the irregularity in plasma is unknown as of now.Even though this appears to be a really beautiful event, it is very hard to see this happening. In order to film this from the earth, special conditions must be present: 150–500 km (93–311 mi) of a clear view to a powerful thunderstorm with positive lightning between cloud and ground, red-sensitive recording equipment, and a black unlit sky.

For the first time, individuals with paraplegia will be able to take home this exoskeleton technology, use it every day and maximize on the physiological and psychological benefits we have observed in clinical trials.Additionally, powered exoskeletons of a larger, stronger kind have many more uses. Emergency responders can use exoskeletons to increase their strength, thus allowing them to lift large amounts of rubble and save survivors in collapsed buildings or rock slides, or allowing them to lift larger patients by themselves.So many diseases come from defective genes — but what if we could just replace those defective genes? That’s the idea behind genome editing, which has been gaining a lot of steam in recent years. With this technological advance comes a major opportunity to wipe out tons of genetic diseases.As we run out of gasoline, alternative energy sources are a place that many companies are beginning to invest. It’s an area of growth, and it’s where our future is. Solar energy is perhaps the most prolific of the alternative energy sources.With the right tax policies, such as a mechanism for pricing the cost of carbon, there is no reason solar thermal power cannot be cost-competitive with fossil fuels in the near future.Many technologies hold the ability to be a game changer here, including nanoparticles, transparent solar panels,We’re running out of fresh water. I know this sounds weird in a world that is mostly water, but unfortunately all of our oceans are salt water. Desalination has existed for a while, but it’s been expensive and not viable as a reliable source of water. But — you guessed it — that’s changing!Because we’re new to the field, we’re not bound by the status quo in health care, and as a result, we’re poised to find very creative solutions. … Our technology could really change the way that consumers view their own health. So if they’re feeling sick, they can immediately know if it’s something that they need to be worried about.With so many determined teams looking to find a solution, this innovative new device should become a reality soon.Farming is hard work. It requires a lot of effort with a relatively low and unreliable return, but drones are changing that.Storing large amounts of energy is hard. This has been one of the major challenges for alternative energy sources, which generate energy at varying times. For example, solar panels generate a lot of energy during the day, but none at night, and wind turbines generate energy at extremely random rates. Sometimes there is too much energy from these sources, and at other times too little.

To counter that you’re opting for a real large number in the “universe size” field but you are well aware that your super computer as advanced as it may be, can only sustain a finite universe size. You know from previous simulations that in a few hundred thousand years they will start discovering the laws of this world and begin to challenge them, also in about a million years they will probably come very close to some of those limits.But wait if you leave the speed of light as high as it is, humans will expand too fast, they will reach the edge of the universe and realize that they live in a simulation. This realization will put your project in great danger, the whole thing may collapse or even worse, they may try to find ways to escape this prison world, and they may succeed with possibly devastating consequences.But don’t lose faith, because here comes “speed of light” to the rescue. This imaginary speed limit well known to anyone engaging in simulations. All you have to do is enter a really, really low value as the maximum speed in this universe, to bring human expansion to a near halt. Moreover, you can implement an algorithm called “Einstein”,this fail safe mechanism guarantees that this speed can never be surpassed, and with SOL being so miserably low, your subjects will never escape their fantastic prison…But wait there is a bonus, you can also add this new super efficient universe expansion algorithm that has almost no additional computing power or space requirements but makes their escape that much more impossible, because hey, better safe that sorry right?Edit:So nice to have your first answer on Quora upvoted by a few people like yourselves! I also realize now that many Optimizations can be made to my answer. For example, if you’re building a simulation you probably wouldn’t insert a fixed universe size rather than a dynamic one that gets randomly generated on the fly, to save space and CPU time. The bigger the expansion of humans, the more you have to pay for these resources. So as a future simulator, the slower the speed of light, the less money you have to spend on equipment or the more simulations you can run with the same machine.

This isn’t a speed “limit” is is simply “the speed”. This “causal connection” gives us the only ordering of events that all observers in a frame of reference can agree on.The real issue is the “frame of reference”. The only way we can move from one frame of reference to another frame of reference and still have a consistent description of how the universe works, is through some math called the Lorentz transformation which describes the relationship between space and time. The Lorentz transformation requires a constant “c” which describes the “speed of causality”, or how two areas of space time are related to each other. The Lorentz transformation allows for a version of Maxwell’s equations that is invariant to frame of reference transformation, but for the math to work out, it needs to have a non-infinite constant. If the speed of causality was infinite, the way that Galileo and Newton thought it was, then there could be no mass, as mass is an impediment to velocity. There could be no time or space or cause or effect. So the very fact that there is mass, means there must be a finite speed of causality which just happens to be 299729458m/s.All this all starts to seem a bit circular, and in many ways it is.No, the speed of causality, (the speed at which light happens to travel) isn’t slow, or fast or anything, it just is. It just happens to be part of the fundamental nature of the universe. If it was a different speed we would have a different universe.

Of course the actual amount of change was infinitesmal, but it was definitely different.The reason the speed of light has been considered the absolute maximum speed that can be traveled is that as one approaches the speed of light, time slows down when compared to the rest of the universe, and should the speed of light actually be attained, time would actually stop altogether, when compared to the rest of the universe.A difficult concept to grasp, I know.

The thing is that’s how fast it goes. It’s slow. It’s not even a lot of digits - and digits in mathematics can make even the universe look small - heck, we can even assign a number to the atoms in the universe - but that’s a big number and the speed of light isn’t.So while I can’t tell you what makes light as slow as it is, I hear you brother.
