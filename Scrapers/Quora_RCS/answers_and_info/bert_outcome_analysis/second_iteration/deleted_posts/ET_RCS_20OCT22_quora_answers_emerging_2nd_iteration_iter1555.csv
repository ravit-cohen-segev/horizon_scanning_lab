There will be some industries you’ll come to know who give more preference to A-class business schools when it comes to hiring an employee.So, if you’re looking to avail an MBA course then why not target Tier 1 Business schools like IIMs. Prepare for entrance tests like CAT, CMAT, GMAT, MAT, etc., while the preparations won’t be easy but you can avail training from top-class institutes.If I have to suggest then you can choose from Career Launcher or TIME institute to prepare the tests well.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,3.6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-of-doing-MBA
1,"I am an MBA student from one of the top five institutes in India. I am not going to give you tangential information that everybody is going to give you anyway. Lets get to the point.Not everybody gets placedIf you open up a newspaper and see 100% placements in IIM-XYZ, you are being fooled.I am an MBA student from one of the top five institutes in India. I am not going to give you tangential information that everybody is going to give you anyway. Lets get to the point.Not everybody gets placedIf you open up a newspaper and see 100% placements in IIM-XYZ, you are being fooled.Note 1: By fat pay packages I mean Fixed component of salary exceeding 18 lakh per year. By average pay packages I mean Fixed component of salary exceeding 12 lakh per year.Note 2: I am not even talking about lower ranked IIMs and new IIMs. The situation is not any better there also.Salary you see is not salary MBA candidates get:MBA CTCs are way different than engineering CTCs- even more bloated. There is a fixed component which everybody gets every month. It is comparatively a smaller part of what you see as a fat CTC being advertised in newspapers. Other components are variable salary that depends on performance, ESOPs (stock ownership) which one gets in 3 to 5 years, one time joining bonus which can be as large as 5 lakh, one time year end bonus etc. So when somebody says his CTC in 35 lakh, ask what he is getting next month.Placement teams in MBA institutes literally rule two years even in terms of their own placements:Now if you can work decently hard, this is where you want to be if you want best returns from your MBA.A little background on placement teams in MBA institutesComing back to how it can help you professionally? Nobody exactly know but there are speculations that they make sure they have good enough relations with companies to guarantee their own placements.I guess now you get the idea where you want to be when you get into your MBA program.MBA is not only about academics:I have seen gold medalists and course toppers being placed in average companies. They all know their shit. However, MBA is different in this regard. People are looking for good communicators. Nobody comes into IIMs for a back-office job. Your academic performance is just one of the criteria for your CV to get selected from many CVs that your placement team may give to companies. After that it’s your performance in GDs and Interviews. A CGPA of 10 can’t save a bad interview. In engineering, a good coding session can save bad communication skills. In MBA, communication skills and performance under stress is of utmost importance.MBA placement is going to be the most stressful days of your lives:DComing back to our own story, long back somebody got this brilliant idea to pack up placements in 3–4 days and brag about it in media. Now every top institute does it. Companies are okay with it as it takes less of their time. The result is that in those 3–4 days companies keep on coming every hour. Students are expected to be present in dedicated placement rooms throughout the day in formal attire. It is possible that at the same time an institute placement team is catering to 4 or 5 different companies. GDs and interviews keep on happening throughout the day, students keep getting interview calls, and they are being judged every hour. At times they get 30 minutes to read about the company and what they are offering. And in that mess you keep hearing names of the hires when a company decides to leave. It is tiring as hell. And one keeps on seeing tens of Symonds and Haydens in the room even when a Ponting gets placed. And this keeps on happening all throughout the day for 12 or 14 or 16 freaking hours.And what do we get out of this mess? An opportunity to brag about how we completed those placements in 3 days. Such a small number sounds a little impossible right? It is. Like every other sh*t we have a tweak for it also. It is called a ‘pre-placement’ process. So the placement team calls as many elite companies as they like in a pre- placement process and they don't count pre-placement days in actual placement. So when you see the news that an institute has completed its placements in one day, you are simply being fooled.Ragging happen in IIMs - although officially:Yeah, you heard that right. IIMs are pretty delusional places. They preach something and act exactly opposite of it. So let's get straight to the culprits. These people are the senior batch students and placement teams. They scream at you, call you words, harass you, penalize you, make you do hours of wastefully stuff and do everything they deem fit in the name of preparing you for the future and for placements. And this is all known to the faculty; perhaps they may not know the extent of it. I have experienced that although they preach that they are doing a holy duty, they do get their sadist fun out of it. And they also do it for their own sake. So prospective students should be ready for sleepless nights and busy days.The best way to network is to join a club, a team or a group:Let's get this straight - IIM students are not among the best in more or less any of the extracurricular activities. Any university cricket team will beat any IIM cricket team any day of the year. So the best bet you can get out these clubs is what we call as networking. Networking is nothing but an acknowledgement of give and take relationships. It has nothing to do with friendships - which are anyway non existent in IIMs. When you network it simply means that the other person gets to know what can be your use to him, and you know what can be his use to you, and of-course you exchange small talks every now and then. It is also an acknowledgement of future politics that can be played together. These networks help immensely in other clubs/ teams’ selections, corporate competitions, placements and CV point collection. Winning a corporate competition is of great value as it shines on a CV which helps in placements, and you get hefty prize moolah. Many of these competition winners get direct Pre-placement offers and Pre-placement interviews. Worth a shot, Isn’t it? Now I need to write something about CV points. I'll write about it in next edit.So, how can these clubs help you in placements? Because they give you titles like 'President', 'Secretary' etc. And they give you immense opportunities to do wasteful stuff in the name of institute branding and placements. Anything that give you these titles shine on CVs. If these titles come from academic societies like Marketing society, Consulting society etc., they shine more. So, if interested in doing some extra activities, students must look forward to join these clubs which have such aforementioned titles.The strongest single sheet of paper you will ever see will be your CV:Students spend months to collect what they call as CV points. Every action of theirs has a thought of how it would look on a CV. Anything which makes a CV stand out is gold. These CVs actually go to companies that visit campus and they select CVs which they like. So, consequently if you don’t have a good CV you would not be selected for interviews and GDs. Even inside interview rooms most of the talk is centered around your CV and it plays a huge role in your selection. There is a concept of a ‘perfect-balanced’ CV. It means that the CV has good amount of academic merit, good amount of numbers, decent amount of positions of responsibility, decent amount of extra-curricular activities, and some amount of CV points that make you stand out, for example, winning a corporate competition.“You need years of experience to do an MBA” is a false statement, at least in India:Actually, there are many jobs in IIMs cut out for freshers. Most of the sales & marketing companies prefer freshers over experienced candidates. It includes high paying jobs like Marketing in HUL and P&G. Many companies even set the maximum limit of experience as 2 years as an eligibility criteria. In many other jobs also freshers are allowed to participate. The problem crops up when there are too many freshers in the batch, and that seldom happens.The same qualifies for people who have too many years of experience(greater than four years). There are a fixed no. of jobs for such candidates also and too many of them can create a problem. In fact many of older students of the batch find themselves unemployable during placements.So the best case scenario for non-marketing jobs would be 2 years of experience, and the best case scenario for marketing jobs would be 0–2 years of experience.Note: I have written this solely for the Indian context and for normal MBA students. There are always exceptions and Einsteins.PSI am not sure who this dude is who has claimed in the comments section to have written this answer. I am not going to reveal my or my institute's identity under any circumstances.People who have been in the placement teams and reaped fruits of it are going to negate this answer with all their might. I have learned to ignore them. They have their reasons.So, people who don't believe this or questions the credibility have all the right to do so. However, the content speaks for itself.As far as I am concerned, I am not at all frustrated. I just stated facts. I got a pretty decent job, and currently I don't deserve more. So this answer has been written very calmly.","62,822 followers",Akand Sitra,2.9K,371,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-of-doing-MBA

I could find the reason within me and find a solution through meditation.Looking back on my mind, I could see deeply how I treated people. Reproachful thoughts about others filled my mind, and I felt 'I'm right.' My words reflected my thoughts. So with my words, I used to wound others' feelings. It was hard to control because of my self-centered mind. The mind I had was like a thorn. That's why it wasn't easy to communicate.I could discard those thorns that I had with meditation.Significant changes through discarding the mind. The process of emptying my mind was the process of removing my thorns. All the minds that I had were self-centered. The more I discard my self-centered mind, my judgment of others reduced naturally, and I could accept others better. The more I discard the minds, my true mind, which is our original mind revealed. Communication becomes much more comfortable. And people liked to listen to me as well.When we treat others with a true mind, our origin, we can communicate well with others. The most effective way to do this is to cleanse one's mind(ex. frame, judgment, mind that I am right, the mind of blame, etc.)Even kids would know what kind of mind I speak. Cleansing our minds is an essential process for everyone.

7,"There are tons of great advice on communication skills out there. Some focus on the basics of non-verbal communication like posture, smiling, eye contact, nodding, etc.; some talk about strategies; some emphasize the importance of active listening. I tried some of them and found them all very helpful. But here, I just want to share how self-reflection and meditation helped me to put those advice into practice.“How can I communicate well?” This used to be one of the biggest questions in my life. I was struggling to be fully engaged in a conversation. I got easily distracted, bored, and tired. IThere are tons of great advice on communication skills out there. Some focus on the basics of non-verbal communication like posture, smiling, eye contact, nodding, etc.; some talk about strategies; some emphasize the importance of active listening. I tried some of them and found them all very helpful. But here, I just want to share how self-reflection and meditation helped me to put those advice into practice.“How can I communicate well?” This used to be one of the biggest questions in my life. I was struggling to be fully engaged in a conversation. I got easily distracted, bored, and tired. I felt really sorry to the person I was listening to. Even though I knew that I wasn’t really listening but I couldn’t help it. I didn’t know why and what to do. I was frustrated whenever I found myself failing to listen to people and open their minds.After I started to meditate, even though poor communication was not particularly the reason I started meditation, I looked back on myself who was unable to communicate well. Meditation helped me to discover some main causes. First, distraction!Thoughts about past experiences; plans or worries about future; and irrelevant ideas kept coming and interrupting the conversation.I continued to reflect on myself. I also found thatIn the self-reflecting practice, I found that I was exactly like what Stephen Covey said,“The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand. We listen to reply.”While someone was talking, I used to be preparing how to reply and trying to come up with a good advice, instead of listening. I prepared to reply because conversations were a kind of competition in my subconscious level. And I tried to give advice because I wanted to look smart. I also felt some pressure that I had to give some advice because I believed that people were expecting it. Now I know that I was wrong. There was no need to be competitive or feel pressured.I meditated and cleansed what I had in my mind. ThenI am also a better speaker now.I used to worry a lot about what people might think about me. So, I always tried to prepare my speech in my head. It became my mental habit, which almost felt natural, but it was a huge stress subconsciously. My speech may have been technically good but it wasn’t natural or genuine. I knew that I wasn’t able to touch people’s heart or feel connected. That made me feel inferior and unhappy with myself.Another problem was that it wasn’t easy for me to show my weakness or to ask for help because I was scared to be rejected. I often talked in a blurry way, hoping that people could notice what I was expecting and helped me voluntarily.After I realized all these were the blockages in communications, I threw them away. Then, thank God, at last I was able to be myself with people. I felt free, relaxed and confident. Now I can be honest and clear when I talk. I am not afraid of making mistakes or others’ saying ‘no’. I am better now in accepting stupid side of me without criticizing myself as well as clever side of me without feeling too proud. It is much easier to look at myself objectively.If you reflect on yourself, you can pinpoint what is the blockage in communication. And if you recognize what it is and accept it as a part of yourself, you can let go of it. You may think it’s easier said than done. Yes, you are right. However, you certainly can if you WANT to.I’d like to share a video clip that gives wisdom about effective communication.","246,667 followers",Dushka Zapata,902,8.5K,231.7M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-improve-your-communication-skills

Some of the rules that should be include in such a contract are, first and foremost respect to their teacher, respect to other students, walking in your classroom ready and commuted to learn, (i.e., classroom management is the life and blood of your teaching career experience and, without order in you classroom you have nothing!!) If you can’t control your class from the start, for sure you won’t be able to teach anything to your students. I will give you the full spectrum of what classroom management means nowadays in our so complicate educational system. Classroom management is the way in which an educator delivers the classroom curriculum, lessons and the environment they provide for their students. There are many strategies that are used to provide students of all ages with an effective learning experience. Classroom management strategies create consistency in the classroom, keep students on task, and set consequences to correct students’ wrong behaviors. I would show you my personal guide and strategies that I have used throughout my teaching career in the past, remember that it’s very important to have a group of well discipline students so your lessons could be effective taught and thoroughly learn .Classroom Management PlanI believe Classroom Management is the key component in any educational setting. I believe that if students are in a safe environment, then learning can take place. This doesn’t necessarily mean punishing behavior problems but rather a combination of setting the tone in a class, preventing behavior problems with interesting and engaging curriculums and effectively including all students in the classroom so that their needs are met. Having the right environment for all students to learn is my major goal of implementing good classroom management--without it the students would not be able to learn.My Philosophical StatementI am committed to making my classroom a safe and challenging environment and engaging my students through the curriculum as well as getting to know them and interacting with them one-on-one. I believe that meeting the needs of my students is a very crucial part of my classroom. I want them to be comfortable with the other students, as well as me, so that there can be meaningful discussions and interactions. Talking will be common place in my classroom, along with group work. I want to encourage all students to participate in class so that they can learn from each other as well as me. I want to have a democratic and equitable classroom so that students can learn. I want to be a fair as I can be, so the students trust me.I feel that I have a very patient and calm attitude with my class. I ask students about their life outside of class and feel that they respond in class even more, knowing that someone is paying attention to them. I want them to feel comfortable asking questions of me. I think my attitude towards the students is not overbearing or authoritative. I do not believe in forcing the students to do anything. I want to work with them in all circumstances so that we can achieve together and they don’t feel like I am spoon-feeding them information. I want students to be a part of their learning. I want to motivate students to learn and keep their interest by using engaging curriculum. I want to involve students in rules about the classroom as well as what curriculum they would like to study. I believe if students feel they are involved in the workings of the classroom, they will be more motivated to engage in the class and in turn, learn.Room ArrangementWalking through the door, students are hit with vibrant colors on the walls, natural lighting from the windows and an inviting sensation as they glide along the carpeting. They feel safe and welcome wandering to their seats in a big circle of tables. They can see their classmates as they face each other and glance from wall to wall looking at maps, art, famous people, different cultures and student work all depicted in colorful posters around the room. There is not a drop of white paint to be seen. The carpet on the floor is comforting to the student and yields a form of tranquility amidst the invigorating walls. As I start the lesson from my desk, which is also included in the circle, the students get out their journals and colorful pens to record today’s lesson and their personal thoughts, questions or even art. I believe the set up of a classroom has a big effect on student learning and I hope that my classroom will be an environment that will engage my students in critical thinking, discussions and reflection.Having the tables in a circle will create an environment rich in discussions. I think it is very important to engage students in discussion to try to draw out and challenge ideas and let the class learn from each other. No one is sitting behind the circle or on the sides of the room; the class enjoys the eye contact and facial expressions of everyone as they share ideas. Students can ""create knowledge, not simply absorb it from higher authorities,"" (p. 439, Bigelow) in the classroom where personal experiences are shared and learned. I believe the circle of tables encourages discussion and in turn, students learn from each other.I believe that students should be constantly challenged and provoked to think critically. I put an array of posters on the walls to show an outline of the year ahead. The posters cover the walls from floor to ceiling–there is not a speck of blank white wall--just as I don’t want my students to engage their minds on blank white walls for fear that their minds might become the same--blank. I will use all the posters throughout the year and hope that they will engage the student’s minds while sitting in class. Even if the students are not paying full attention and their mind is wandering, I hope to catch a few of them thinking about the posters inquisitively. I want to have thought-provoking pictures to invoke interest in the students whether it be artwork of different times, or pictures of people (men, women and all races and ethnicities) or landmarks throughout the world or just a black and white photo of the dust bowl.I want supplemental materials for students to have access to for studying, writing or researching. I will have bookshelves in the corner where students can research and use resources supplemental to the textbooks. There will be a few computers for projects, reports and research, as well as use of applications to present reports to the class (i.e. PowerPoint). Students will also have access to the computer lab in the school where they can learn social studies as well as technology by integrating the lessons. This will foster a holistic-learning approach that I will strive to teach to my students. We will not be solely learning the facts of history, but will be integrating art, math, geography, science and psychology to deepen our understanding of our units.As you can see by my drawings (see Attachments 1 and 2), I want to create an environment in my classroom that is conducive to discussions and groupwork. By arranging the students where they are facing each other, I believe this leads to a more intimate environment as well as a space where I can get to every student easily. I like to walk around the room while teaching, rather than staying in one stationary place in the front. If the tables are arranged as so, I can walk around, engage more students, and hopefully create an environment where students can talk and share ideas freely and comfortably. I am also a big advocate of groupwork and I show in my second map how the desks will ""magically"" change to accommodate groupwork. I would have all students sitting together with all the desks facing into the group. This will lead to discussions and will not let anyone feel left out of the group physically. I intend to use groupwork as a different instructional technique to include as many learners as I can–using multiple-ability tasks so that every level of learner can be an active participant and they can learn from each other.My desk will be in the corner of the room, but used mostly for my administrative tasks. I will have a computer in which to keep grades and will have lesson plans, attendance sheets and miscellaneous paperwork organized there. I will take a seat in the ""circle"" to conduct lessons as well as moving around the room. I would like to have resources available for the students such as dictionaries, atlases, and books pertaining to the unit. These resources could be additional materials that students can look through out of curiosity or of obtaining extra information on a subject. Of course, I would love to have a few computers in the classroom so that we could use them to enhance the curriculum–whether looking on my homepage for assignments to using them for new research or using them to type essays into Word. I also will have butcher paper and plenty of markers, colored pencils and crafts items in which the students can create presentations. I intend to involve the students in drawing, making, singing, rapping or making mobiles of the lessons and I want to be equipped in having materials for them to use and be creative. I would love to have maps around my room as well as posters of different cultures and peoples as well as different places. I will frequently put student work on the wall so students feel a ""part"" of the room.Classroom RulesThe best rule that I have heard and I would believe to be my attitude towards classroom rules is that I need a classroom where learning takes place, and if we can respect each other then we don’t need any other ""rules."" I absolutely believe in keeping a safe environment where put-downs and name calling is not allowed–this also falls under respect. If I can have respect for my students as well as having them respecting each other, I believe this leads to a safe environment where learning can take place. I am not a stickler for gum chewing or eating and drinking as long as it does not interfere with learning and doesn’t make a mess. I would like to give my kids the freedom to eat or drink as long as they are responsible for their trash and mess. If it gets out of control, I will let them know that the privilege will be taken away, right from the beginning. I also do not mind if students wear hats in class. To me this is an ancient rule and as long as the hat does not interfere with learning, then I will let them wear them.I may try to create a class constitution if behaviors in the class are inconsistently out of control. I really like the idea of having the students involved in making their own rules and negotiating with each other which ones to put in the constitution. If the students are involved in making the rules, I believe they will be more inclined to obey them and the consequences that will be implemented will not be fought against. I would have the students write the final constitution on a poster board and hang it in the room. I would also send the constitution home to have the parents sign it and return it to me so that I can include them in what we are trying to accomplish in the classroom.In terms of creating a safe environment for all to learn, I want to create an environment with positive and numerous student-teacher relationships. Especially in diverse classrooms where many students are from different backgrounds, I want to create an environment where students are not and do not feel that they are being treated unfairly. I do not want to label students or assume their academic ability on the way they look or act. I do not want the diverse settings to lead to situations where communication is not happening. I feel this is where behavior problems may arise. I want to create an environment where ""teachers accept them [students] as individuals with unique and cultural difference; to respect, relate and like them; to listen and communicate openly; and the understand and honor their family, culture, language, and race."" (Sheets and Gay, 1996) I believe to succeed in having a classroom like this it is necessary to have great interpersonal skills even more than classroom management skills. I want to create an environment where I can weave the curriculum into m students’ different lives and experiences. I want them to be able to share these experiences and relate them to the material we are working with. This is a major plus of a diverse classroom. Where we can celebrate differences and learn from each other.I would also like to implement some class meetings where we can discuss what is working and not working with the class. I would like these to be like an open forum where ideas and suggestions can be discussed and hopefully implemented. I am very interested in learning what the students are thinking about and making the learning environment as much to their liking as possible. I think this dialogue is crucial in creating an environment where the students feel autonomous and in control of their learning.I would also use class meetings to discuss whole-school rules. I would hope that the school in general takes some time during the year to discuss policies with the students to get student feedback. In my high school this year, there was class time assigned to discussing the issue of homework. The administration is taking the feedback of the students to decide how to solve the issue of students having too much homework. I believe that it is imperative to adhere to whole-school rules in order to have an effective policy in the school. I will try my best to follow the whole-school rules where they make sense for the safety of the students or for order in the school. If I do not agree with the school rules, I will be talking to administration to see if there may be alternative possibilities.In addition to making a class constitution, I would like to send out a monthly newsletter or post one on the web so parents can see what is going on in the classroom. I believe if parents are involved in their child’s school, the child will have more support at home and the parent can help with any issues that arise. I believe in involving the parents as much as possible.If there is a consistent misbehavior problem, I will initially ask the student to talk to me after class. I will talk to him/her about the positive things they are doing in class and how I appreciate something they are doing, as in participating in class for example. I will tell them why their behavior is interfering in the class and have them meet with me later to make a plan of how they will be able to stop the behavior. In class, I will give them a warning and then ask them to move to the back of the room to work by themselves. I always want to keep consequences in line with the misbehavior. If the misbehavior continues, I will talk to the student and make a phone call home. I might also ask the parent to come into school for a meeting with the student. I think it is very important to involve the parents. I do not believe in throwing a student out of the room unless they are being harmful to others or me in the class–either physically or verbally. I believe that misbehavior should be addressed with the teacher and student communicating as much as possible. I feel that sending students to the ""office"" is overused.Classroom ProceduresI want to be consistent with my students in terms of Classroom Procedures. I always want to have the agenda on the board so they can copy it down in their notebook everyday as they walk in. On some days I hope to have a free-writing assignment so I can take role and they can be engaged and working on their writing. I will use interactive notebooks so students can do all homework assignments in the notebook as well as take class notes in the notebook and staple in any handouts. The purpose of this notebook is to keep all class materials in one place so when they go to study for a test, they are not looking all over for loose papers. In these notebooks, students can show their creativity in designing a cover page for each unit as well as doing free-writes or reflections to the lessons and central questions right in the notebook. I will go around the room and stamp the homework each day it is due and will collect the notebooks every two or three weeks to grade. Even if the student did not get the homework done, they may lose a point because they did not have a stamp, but still has time to get the assignment done by collection time. By stamping the homework and not grading it, it adds consistency to the classroom but does not lead to negative feelings every day of having the homework graded.I am still debating my thoughts on homework. I keep coming back to a philosophy of my professor at Stanford who said that homework is a distinction between the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" I believe this is the case because there is a clear line in my classes who does their homework every night, who doesn’t and who even has a tutor to help with essays. I don’t believe in giving homework for homework’s sake. I believe in giving out 2-3 nights a week of homework that enhances what we are discussing in class. I will give my students the homework assignment at least every week so that they can plan their weeks in advance. I want to give my students advance notice to help them with time management.In terms of wrapping up, I want to also have an essential question that the lesson is revolving around. I believe the students will understand where we are going and it leads to an effective wrap-up at the end of class. I want to make sure I leave at least five minutes to wrap up the lesson and reiterate the important points brought up that day. I will use different forms of assessment to make sure students understand the information. Whether by passing out a half-sheet and asking for ""three points they learned today"" to having a discussion around the main points. I may give out an unannounced quiz but not have it graded so I can find out where students are at. I would like to grade more on final essays that have drafts attached rather then standard tests. I want to make sure my students understand the material as well as using higher-order thinking skills to analyze, interpret or evaluate the material. I believe essays are more equipped to let the students express their learning. I would also like to give out assignments where the students can choose a medium to demonstrate their knowledge of a given subject or unit. By letting them choose their way of showing competence, the students have another way to express their learning and it will allow students that aren’t a high level of reading or writing a chance to use other methods of creativity.If students are having some trouble getting homework in or not doing well on tests, I will have a conference with them to help them get back on track. I will make a plan with them that their parents will sign, if necessary (see Attachment 3). I do not want my students falling behind because they are not doing their work. I want to stay on top of the students who may need an extra push. I want all my students to feel important in my class and another way I can accomplish this is helping them with their schoolwork and organization. I will be another person setting high expectations for all my students and helping those who may need some extra attention to accomplish their goals in the classroom. ""If students believe their poor performance to a lack of important skills or to poor study habits, they are more likely to persist in the future."" (Anderman, Midgley, 1998) I want to students to understand that they do have control over their learning and it is not an innate skill or gene. I want to help those who need it most by working with them one-on-one if necessary.I would grade on class participation including attendance, homework, groupwork and tests and quizzes. I would love to have the students create a portfolio of their work in alignment with their notebooks so they can be graded on their improvement and competency with the material so it is not solely graded on traditional tests and quizzes. I have attached a course outline for my classroom (see Attachment 4). I would probably put homework at only 10% of the grade tests/presentations at 25% and group work at 25% of their grade. Group work is graded both at a group level but also at an individual level. I would like to grade as holistically as possible and I do not want students who are successful on tests, presentations or group work assignments to be penalized too much if they are not completing all assignments. My policy on late work will be that it is accepted but at a lower grade. I want students to learn, first. I do not want them to forget an assignment just because they missed the deadline. I want them to do the assignment and learn from it and if it is handed in late, well their grade on the assignment will automatically go down.Encouraging All StudentsBill Rogers, affectionately know as Mr. Rogers, has many effective techniques and approaches to classroom management, from prevention and positive correction to consequences. Mr. Rogers, I believe, takes a very logical and humane approach to dealing with students. He does not advocate being a strict, disciplinarian, authoritarian teacher, but gives strategies to help teachers work with students to control their own behavior. The first part of Rogers’ plan gives techniques used to prevent discipline problems. In the establishment phase, he distinguishes rights from responsibilities and says that they need to be balanced. As he discusses rights of the students, he talks about how they have the right to feel safe, be treated with dignity and respect and have the right to learn. I think it is crucial in the beginning of the school year to state these rights and explain what the students need to do to have these rights. In order to establish a learning environment, students need to feel safe physically and emotionally; they need to treat each other with respect, which means not allowing name-calling or put-downs in the class. I found this strategy particularly useful, as my CT’s only ""rule"" at the beginning of the year was to ""respect each other, the classroom and the teacher in order to create an environment in which to learn."" All negative language in the classroom is immediately stopped and I believe the students now feel safe to express themselves without fear of being made fun of. This prevents discipline problems as kids might act out if they are feeling attacked or unsafe in the classroom.Also in the establishment phase is the idea that you have to be consistent with your rules that you really want to establish. One must make sure which rules you want your kids to obey and you must be absolutely consistent in letting them know what is appropriate or not. I agree with this prevention strategy because once a student is not held accountable, then the problem will just perpetuate. Rogers talks about re-claiming teachable moments and how it is hard if you don’t catch a problem right from the beginning. I believe that this may make it easier in the long run, but I do not think you have to use a teachable moment right from the start to have it be meaningful. I believe if a problem is really out of control after two months or even five months, a proper, forceful teachable moment could teach the same thing even being later in the class.Establishing attention is one last preventative technique. Rogers insists that you should not talk over noise. I agree with this prevention and I notice that when I stand in the same place in the room, the kids will quiet down. If I ""wait"" for them to be quiet, they will quiet each other down. Establishing this early on is crucial in having an environment conducive to teaching and learning. It is essential that directions are heard and important points in class are heard.While Rogers talks about Positive Correction, he emphasizes reacting from the ""head"" versus the gut. I believe this is a very logical way to view correction. Instead of escalating an argument with a student as with secondary behavior, Rogers suggests stepping back and addressing just the primary behavior. He suggests not giving in to the secondary behavior, such as back talking or body language. He suggests using a technique of partial agreement that also focuses on the primary behavior. To me, this keeps a humane side of correcting a student. I believe it coincides with a theory of Linda Albert’s which says that students misbehave when there needs are not met. Teachers can only influence behavior; they can not control it. By escalating an argument with secondary behavior, the teacher may be asserting control over the student. Neither Rogers nor Alberts agrees with this technique and argue against it. I think this helps the student take control of the situation. The teacher is not being pulled in, away from the rest of the class, just to assert control and prove their point. It is not an effective way to correct positively. Rogers talks about separating the action from the person.He also agrees with Alberts that students need to have the choice to control his or her behavior. By giving ""take up time"" the teacher lets the student save face in front of his classroom. Rogers suggests giving directions and immediately walking away. I believe this is a great way for students to be able to make a choice about their behavior. If the teacher stands in front of the student to ""make"" him do something, the students will naturally want to ""be tough"" in front of classmates and will probably disobey the teacher. When the teacher walks away, the student stops being the center of the class’ attention and has the opportunity to make a choice about his/her behavior (hopefully a positive one). I have found this effective when a student is talking out of line, I have asked them to stop, said ""thank you"" and walked away. I did not create a distraction, but let the student make a choice without losing face.Finally, Rogers addresses consequences by helping a student find a connection between behavior and outcome. The consequences need to be related and reasonable. I agree with this last point. It also gives students a chance to choose their own behavior. When consequences are given, the student learns because it is related and reasonable. The student can not get mad at the teacher for an unreasonable punishment and in turn not focus on what he/she did to deserve the punishment. If the consequence is fair and reasonable, I believe students will be able to attribute the punishment to their wrongdoing.One thing Roger does not address in his theories is a point that Kounin talks about in preventing discipline problems, which have to do with the subject matter of the classroom. Kounin emphasizes that teachers should make instructional activities enjoyable and challenging for the students. I believe if the students are busy with work that is relevant to them and is challenging, there will be less discipline problems. I noticed when I substituted, and there was only a video to watch, the students were more out of control than when there was a structured activity that engaged them. Kounin also talks about the smoothness of the lesson that will prevent problems. These teacher-directed suggestions about teaching our content area are not discussed in Rogers’ theories and I believe are definitely a major importance in keeping a room free of discipline problems.One other main point of the different theories that we have read by Dreikurs and Alberts point out that students who are not having their needs met will ""act out"" in order to get their needs met for either attention, power, relevant or inadequacy. Rogers does not address this point and I feel it is another important theory to remember when dealing with classroom management. These needs will help teachers understand some of the reasons why children may be misbehaving in class.I also agree with the Whole School System that Rogers advocates. After listening to the arguments in faculty meetings at our school about the attendance policy, I understand that if the whole school does not buy into it, nothing will get done. The tardy policy is very lenient and the principal has been telling the teachers to mark all students tardy. Some teachers do not think it matters because the students can have 30 tardies before the parent is called in. Because the faculty are not all in agreement about the system, it creates a breakdown and the students do not get a consistent signal about tardies and nothing is done. This goes back to Rogers other point of being consistent with students on policies you really feel are important to enforce. Not only in your classroom is this true, but as a school as a whole.Positive ReinforcementInstead of focusing solely on the misbehavior in the classroom, I want to focus on the good behavior and attitudes in my classroom. I will have the students fill out postcards at the beginning of the year with their address on them. I will use these postcards throughout the year to send positive feedback to the parents at home every week. I will focus on sending a few postcards home each week. I want to acknowledge and encourage good behavior and academic success in my classroom. I think that letting parents know at home is another way to involve parents in the classroom as well as reinforce good behavior and learning by the students. I will make sure that positive post cards home will be given out for all students no matter how big or how small the accomplishment. I will also make some positive phone calls home as these have worked well for me this year. I think parents really appreciate positive phone calls home and it also sets up a dialogue between parents and teachers.I do not believe, however, in using rewards like stickers or stars, A’s or praise. To quote Alphie Kohn, ""When rewards stop, people usually return to the way they acted before."" I want my students to be intrinsically motivated and giving out rewards inhibits intrinsic motivation. ""Students who are encourage to think about grades, stickers, or other ""goodies"" become less inclined to explore ideas, think creatively, and take chances."" (Kohn, 1994) I want my students to know it is okay to make mistakes and take risks in the classroom. I want to encourage my students by telling them specific feedback on an assignment rather than a star and a ""good job."" I don’t want them to become dependent on my praise. I want them to be successful learners. As Dreikurs (1982) argues, ""Encouragement, refers to a positive acknowledgment response to focuses on student efforts of specific attributes or work completed…Unlike praise, encouragement does not place judgment on student work or give information regarding its value or implications of student status. I want to focus on improvement and effort not just a final product.ConclusionAs I stated earlier, I believe Classroom Management is the key to an environment where learning can take place and students can feel safe participating. I hope to create an environment that is conducive to learning and involves all my students. I believe the most important part of classroom management is not the behavior problems but creating a good rapport with the students, encouraging them to succeed and setting high expectations for them. As well as using an engaging a curriculum, I believe you can create this environment and it will limit the behavior problems in your classroom from the start.OK my friend great luck and Let me know if this was of use to your classroom management technique!",964 followers,Sabs Hunter,2K,354,2.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-of-doing-MBA

17,"Part 1 of 3:Communicating with Middle School StudentsResearch has shown that middle schoolers learn best when their lessons are divided in 7-10 minute chunks of different activities. Lessons should be a combination of learning from lecture and processing activities.A processing activity is one in which students must manipulate information or relate the information to something they already know. This might be an activity like writing an alternate ending to a story they have read, conducting a lab experiment, or participating in a debate with their fellow clasPart 1 of 3:Communicating with Middle School StudentsResearch has shown that middle schoolers learn best when their lessons are divided in 7-10 minute chunks of different activities. Lessons should be a combination of learning from lecture and processing activities.A processing activity is one in which students must manipulate information or relate the information to something they already know. This might be an activity like writing an alternate ending to a story they have read, conducting a lab experiment, or participating in a debate with their fellow classmates.Studies show that middle school students can only handle 10-12 minutes of direct instruction (or lecture). After 10-12 minutes, their brains begin to filter out information of the lecture and turn to other thoughts. While lecture is an important component of teaching, you need to supplement it with processing activities.If you are giving a lecture, be sure to present it in an engaging way. Don't just read off of a worksheet or set of notecards. Read as if you are telling a story.Be sure to make eye contact with your students as you are presenting the material. Make sure they know that you are speaking directly to them because you want them to understand the material.Research has shown that middle school students respond most positively to visual images when they process information. Visual images give students concrete, easily digestible information as opposed to abstract information (which they won't be able to grapple with until they are 18-20 years old).Dynamic visuals -- or visuals that move as opposed to remaining static -- have been shown to have the most significant impact on students. Look for charts that have moving elements, films, or a series of interactive images as opposed to just one or two static images.You should also consider using manipulatives, which are physical objects that students can touch in order to learn material from the lesson. They are commonly used in math (such as using blocks to teach geometry), but you might also consider using objects in other areas, like bringing in an old copy of a magazine from the 1930s if you are teaching history.Middle school students need to interact with information directly in order to fully understand it. They no longer view you, as the teacher, as a fount of knowledge; they need to form opinions about the material on their own.Incorporate the Think-Pair-Share method. When you are teaching a particular lesson, ask the students a question about the material. Have them write down a response to the question and then share their ideas with a partner. Then, as a class, discuss your responses out loud.As middle schoolers, most students will relate to the world around them emotionally rather than through logic or reason. As you teach your material, be sure to present it in terms of its emotional impact.The extent to which you can do this in each discipline will vary. But you should incorporate methods such as storytelling into appropriate disciplines like English, social studies and even subjects like science and mathematics.Humor is also a key element in connecting with your students emotionally. Make sure your jokes are appropriate and avoid anything bordering on snark or sarcasm.Above all, make sure your lessons incorporate a wide variety of activities. Ask your students to take notes, write reflection pieces, work in groups, conduct investigations and play games. This will prevent boredom and help your students develop a broad range of cognitive skills.Be sure to incorporate activities that require memorization and repetition on the part of your students. This is a valuable skill that still needs development in the brain at this age. You can use flash cards, rhyming games or simply ask students to repeat vital pieces of information out loud to practice this.Encouraging time for your students to write in a journal about what they have learned or how they experienced the lesson for the day will help them see the broader goals of the classEncouraging your students to come up with their own opinions will help them build solid critical thinking skills.Young adolescents might begin to test the boundaries of authority, but they still need a clear set of rules and boundaries in order to learn.On the first day of class, include your students in the creation of the rules and make sure they understand why they need to be in place. If one of your rules is to respect each other, you should ask your students what this would entail (for instance, taking turns when talking as opposed to speaking over each other).Establish regular routines in your class so your students know what to expect. For instance, you might start each day with an inspirational quote or story relating to your lesson for the day. You can use this routine to warm up discussion amongst your students.Giving your students a syllabus will also help them develop their abilities to plan and organize their study schedules. A syllabus should include the dates of the classes, what you plan to teach on each date, and any reading or assignments that your students should complete before attending that class.In middle school, students often start to form deep friendships and social hierarchies. Students can be harassed or ostracized for things ranging to their appearance to their the race, sexuality or religion. Be sure to look out for this toxic behavior and shut it down whenever you see it occurring between students in your classroom.If a student is acting in a disruptive or disrespectful manner in class, then pull them aside (either after class or at a natural lull in the lesson, like when students begin to work independently), to talk with them. Do not express frustration with them but rather, empathy. Say, ""I noticed that you are having trouble focusing on the assignment. What can I do to help you?"" The student might not respond well to a scolding but they will respond to a question that asks them to reflect on their actions and ask for help.Discuss bullying directly with your students. Have them study its damaging effects and ask them to explain why they must avoid hurting their fellow students.Talk to your administrators about implementing a zero tolerance policy toward bullying at your school. Familiarize yourself with any district policies on bullying or disruptive behavior in the classroom.The adolescent brain and body needs 10 hours of sleep in order to fully develop. If you have students who consistently struggle to remain awake and complete their work, then you should notify their parents about your concerns. There might be a larger medical problem involved.Encourage your students to drink water. The pre-adolescent brain needs to be well hydrated in order to develop. Encourage your students to drink water in class and at lunch.Between the ages of 11 and 13, students are juggling a huge range of physical and psychological changes. In addition to the increase of hormonal production in the body, they are also dealing with the delayed development of the neo-cortex.The neo-cortex is a frontal lobe in the brain that handles executive processes such as making plans, setting goals, and thinking of long term consequences. This part of the brain is the last to develop and is often not fully functioning in early adolescent students.Until the neo-cortex is developed, the brain processes language through the amygdala, or the emotional part of the brain. This is why adolescents often make impulsive decisions based on emotion rather than reason.The increased production of hormones in the early adolescent's body enacts a number of changes on your students. But one change that might be overlooked is an increased sensitivity to stress.In particular, your students may become stressed by the physical changes in their body, such as the awkwardness of a growth spurt or the development of breasts, pubic hair, facial hair, etc. These changes can make your students feel like they have lost control over their own bodies.The early adolescent brain is still developing its social development functions. That means that your students will often be most concerned with themselves first and foremost.Early adolescence is a period where students will need to practice moral reasoning in order to develop empathy and compassion.","105,636 followers",Dave Consiglio,928,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-improve-your-communication-skills

Later, travel agents started acting as a bridge between hotel and guests. The travel agents introduce 'system' and systematic approach but it was also a complete mess as nothing was transparent. Guest gratification was minimum at that time so room service was introduced in early of 1930.By 1947, the first hotel reservation system was introduced and radio was replaced with television. A sense of luxury commenced thriving across the Hospitality world. The hotels were competing among themselves for extravagance, signatures and reputation. However, they were still unable to meet expectations from guests as expectations were different than a luxury; more personalized service, care, attention and ""Home away from home"".With the increments of female travellers, both middle-class and high status, Room service was made available for 24 hours in 1969. Nine years after the establishment of Minibar, soap, shampoo.There was no guestroom telephone till 1986. However, the early '80s brought a remarkable revolution in the Hospitality Industry with electronic key Card and use of credit card. The Use of computers and the Internet was developing throughout the world so the vast change was seen in the year of 1994/1995 when first Hotel website was launched on the internet. The customer now can see a property online with the help of internet.WiFi was made available in every hotel around the world for guests in 2003. The use of smartphone slowly expanded due to which hotel started launching mobile hotel application. The first mobile hotel app for guest service was launched in 2009.All services were made accessible through mobile application gradually with time and Hospitality Industry become a 'smart world'. We now see very advance technology with invisible, voice-controlled A. I service.This is how we have evolved and Hospitality Industry ranks at number one in the use of new technology and Innovation. we often see endless use of new technology's to improve guest satisfaction and to increase efficiency.Technology has a direct significance in the Hospitality Industry. We have seen a tremendous evolution of technology in past decades. More importantly, the Internet has brought a rebellion in this sector bringing it a mode to trusting the brand and fulfilling all necessity.The beginning of New, era has entered in Hospitality Industry after extravagance started to blend in, which brought personalization of experience and digitalization of services.New technologies are reshaping how service is provided and received in the Hospitality Industry. Advancement of State-of-the-art technology has completely changed the service platform and have become the spine for Hospitality establishments. They helps in everything from check-in to check-out.
