(and made it into 5 points)1) Don't optimize.2) Do optimize for simplicity3) Much fancy academic CS is bogus4) The simplest abstractions are usually bestMe: I think a lot of new programmers like to use advanced data structures and advanced language features as a way of demonstrating their ability.  I call it the lion-tamer syndrome.  Such demonstrations are impressive, but unless they actually translate into real wins for the project, avoid them.With each new class/method added to your code, the complexity can increase not linearly but exponentially.    Deleting code is therefore always better than adding code.   Don't put stuff into functions when it could be inline.5) Don't write generalised code","44,239 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,747,13.7K,166.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-5-tips-of-a-productive-developer

4,"1)A good developer knows exactly how to use his/her tools to maximize the amount of time spent creating a solution. If you can conjure up a magic key press that loads in your project, cleans the build then rebuilds your solution in half the time, then it's worth your while to do it. You might only save 3 key presses, but at 10ms each that's 30ms extra thinking time to be ready for the build being finished.The best solutions produce the maximum amount of output for the least amount of input, but without sacrificing quality (In other words, don't cut corners in the process)21)A good developer knows exactly how to use his/her tools to maximize the amount of time spent creating a solution.

Why not for example get your git hooks to automatically run a grunt task when you check something in?3)An hour and a half works for me, others may vary, but take regular breaks, even if it's just to walk across the office and stare out the window at an empty sky for 5 minutes, it gives your brain a chance to calm down a little and perform a pseudo semi reset on itself. If you spend to long concentrating on a singular thing you'll get the programmer's equivalent of writers block, I call it ""Code Blindness"", don't know if that's a thing or not though.4)If you're up against a bit of code that's defeating you, or you just can't quite see how you can make the latest crazy requirement work, then don't try to solve it. The human brain breaks down under pressure, irrespective of how well you believe you are at ""Handling Pressure"", always have at least 2 to 3 other bits of code you can work on, generally something like maintenance tasks or low key projects that don't require too much thought.You'll often find that your cognitive process will churn away in your subconsciousness and solve the problem on its own, in its own time eventually leading you to just being able to sit down and solve things in a short space of time.5)Kind of related to number 4, but not always.You NEVER know when you're going to get a penny drop moment. It might be a major vision about some crazy new technology that the world sorely needs, or it might just be a novel way of re-writing an algorithm you created 2 weeks earlier, that you can now re-write to be more efficient.What ever it is, you need to record it. Be prepared to take notes whenever, wherever.I go through notebooks like they're going out of fashion, and I have (had until I started scanning them all in to my PC) drawers full of the darn things, I've been jotting down notes, ideas potential future solutions for most of my career, and often when I'm looking for a solution, I'll find inspiration just by picking some notes at random and reading through them.A great elegant solution inspired by your notes helps satisfy point number 1, which often leads to being able to help with number 2, many of these inspiration moments are coined in steps 3 & 4, and recorded in step 5, which goes around full circle back to step 1.Source of my answer:","12,557 followers",Abishiekh Jain,11.7K,590,4.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-5-tips-of-a-productive-developer

But I would like to share some tips that I have learnt over these two years that have made me more productive.1.Due to the prolI would not categorise myself as a great programmer as I have been writing production quality code for just two years now. But I would like to share some tips that I have learnt over these two years that have made me more productive.1.Due to the proliferation of web and mobile technologies it has become much easier for developers to hack together a prototype without giving much thought into code design. This mentality is carried out in the jobs as well but we need to understand that there is a lot of difference between a prototype and a full-fledged production system.I have started giving more emphasis on code design and structure. It may have increased the time taken to write code, but  it has saved me a lot of time that was previously wasted on refactoring and finding out the source of bugs.2.A lot of times we ignore automation as we are lazy to set it up or we think that it will not be of much use. But automation can save you a lot of time. If you are spending 30 minutes on something per day that can be automated you can save around 10 hours a month or 120 hours a year, if you are willing to give 4-5 hours to automate it.I have automated a lot of my workflows over the past month and now whenever I see an opportunity that a particular repetitive task can be automated, I go ahead and automate that first. This has contributed a lot to my productivity.3.I also used to think that why should I buy a book when I can learn everything from web. But I was wrong. A good book written by an experienced developer can lead to a lot more improvement than any online tutorial or course. The book goes into the depth of  topics and give you a lot of insights that why the author choose to implement it in a particular way.The book takes you on a journey of the developer and tells you about the mistakes which he made during his working years. This can save you a lot of time if you do not make the same mistakes.4.You must try to choose someone who is not part of your team but someone you admire a lot. He/She preferably must have a similar career path that you aspire for.A good mentor can save you a lot of time and help you make important decisions as he might have been through the same things at some point in his life. If you cannot find someone in your company try reaching out to someone on the web. A lot of great developers will be willing to help you if you willing to reach out to them.5.You must be very careful while choosing the right tools and libraries for your project. Do not use a library that is quite recent and has not been tested much in production, as it can come to bite you and become a source of issues that will be very difficult to debug afterwards.Invest your time and money in learning tools like git, jenkins etc that can save you a lot of time in the long run.Do not rush yourself into writing shitty code due to pressure of deadlines. Writing good code is similar to producing great art. It takes time and patience  to become a master code craftsman. Keep yourself up to date with the latest technologies and be open to learning new things.","3,930 followers",Anumeha Sharma,37.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-5-tips-of-a-productive-developer

Initially, I’d set a timer for a periodic 15 minute chirp, but you can go to a task-based record to reduce the distraction of the recording itself. Remember, you aren’t doing this forever, just for awhile.Now, ruthlessly cut out all those activities that are not writing software. Don’t go to meetings unless your attendance is mandatory, and try to weasel out of those too. Every time you see yourself starting a non-software activities, remind yourself that you must not.As you do this, go on measuring your time use. You’ll get better at this as you go along, so that the timekeeping task takes less time. Review your time log once a week and total up your daily productive time, to see if you are still improving.You can probably double the number of hours each day that you spend on your core activities. I did. It was lonely, but I was in a place in my life where productivity was important, so I stuck with it.Fred Brooks had his staff at IBM do this, and they discovered they only spent 19% of their day on core activities. My own experience bore that out. I was able to get up to 60% on core tasks by this method.","90,938 followers",Divyansh Mundra,6.4K,1.2K,61.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-5-tips-of-a-productive-developer

I'm a pretty heavy multitasker, I regularly have over a dozen tabs open in my browser including things like streaming music. While doing all that, my CPU is only at about 8% usage and is throttled down to 2.0GHz, and I'm only using about 5GB of RAM. So clearly most of the performance in my computer isn't even at use.The one thing in my computer that really boosts performance, as I alluded to earlier, is my SSD. Most everyday tasks are heavily dependent on disk speeds. For example, before a web browser can display a page, it has to cache that page. Faster disks can cache sites faster, meaning web browsing is much smoother. Bootup and logon times are also much faster.The area that having a powerful computer really helps in everyday tasks is when tasks are running in the background. I can render video files in the background on my computer and still have a smooth experience doing anything else, even gaming.","242,280 followers",Roman Saini,4.9K,315,33.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-5-tips-of-a-productive-developer

I could set all the graphics on their maximum settings and then set the anti-aliasing level at 16x and still get over 45 fps.

They’re not excited and not emitting light.Note that what happens here is not really imaging the atom. No details of the atom can be discovered using visible light, that has much longer wavelength, and thus much lower spatial resolution than the dimension of the atom. It’s somewhat similar to observing a faraway star with a telescope. It will always appear as a point-like source, and the size of the image is independent of the real size of the star. It only depends on the diffraction and other interference effects, and the quality of the optics. No details on the star surface are discernible with any practically possible telescope.When you see images like this:It was not captured with a camera. The atomic force microscope produces electronic signals from a scanning probe that is extremely close to the subject. There are no other atoms between the probe and the subject.

You sort of have toAn atomic force microscope uses a very fine tip — maybe an atom wide — and drags it across the surface being scanned. As the tip moves, it gets bumped up and down by the atoms it passes over. Super-precise lasers measure the position of the tip, and a computer decodes their movements as information about the structure of the sample.Here’s a (poor) analogy that shows you the difference between a camera image and an atomic force micrograph.Suppose you’re sitting at a table, blindfolded. An unknown object is placed on the table in front of you.If you remove your blindfold and look directly at the object, that’s like taking a picture with a camera. You get all the information at once.But suppose you’re not allowed to take off your blindfold. Instead, you’re given a pin which you must carefully drag across the tabletop, point down, making a mental note of whenever you feel the pin getting bumped up and down by any obstacles. Then, you must use this data to build a mental map of what the object on the table looks like. That’s more like an atomic force micrograph.Because the tip of the atomic force microscope isThat’s why you don’t see air molecules in “pictures” of atoms.
