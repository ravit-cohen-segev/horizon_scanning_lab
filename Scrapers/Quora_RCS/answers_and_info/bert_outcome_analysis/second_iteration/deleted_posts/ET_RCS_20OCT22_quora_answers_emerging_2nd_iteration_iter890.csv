All these add complexity to the algorithm at the pretext of offering the advantages of a normal BST.HeapsTreapsA treap combines the best of both heaps and binary search trees. When you construct a heap, you basically build an ordered binary tree AND make it satisfy the “heap” property. However, if done with a single element, it will look like a line (because in a BST, the left child must be less than its parent and the right child must be greater than or equal to its parent, but for a heap, each parent should either be all bigger than its children or all smaller than its children). So we introduce another key (See picture).The numbers indicate the heap arrangement of the data structure (arranged in max heap order), and the alphabets indicate the tree part of things (left child < parent <= right child). So now you have a treeNow, here’s theNow to make that second key a little more useful for us, we use a random heap weight. So now, the structure (shape) of the tree will depend entirely on the randomized weight we gave the heap values. By making sure we assign these randomly (one way is by hashing the keys themselves), we get randomized heap priorities.To insert a new key, you generate the priority and do a regular BST insertion and then rotate it up the tree (to maintain the heap). To delete a key, you make its weight infinite, and rotate it down the tree (again, in heap order) until it becomes a leaf, and then remove it.So it’s a tree with regards to the keys and a heap with regards to the priorities.A treap is therefore a good platform to build a randomized binary search tree.Why is it remarkable?1. It’s a2. It is also a randomized data structure3. It’s a binary search tree essentially, so to print a sorted order of keys, just traverse it in order like you would regular BSTs. Searching a treap is like searching a tree4. Regardless of the order of how you add, delete, etc, because of the randomized weights, there is a high probability that the tree will be balanced (a random binary search tree has logarithmic height)5. A treap basically combines probability, randomization, two popular CS data structures, etc to make a highly useful data structure. From a CS student’s point of view, try to learn about Treaps first, and you get to learn BSTs, traversals, hashing, tree rotations, heaps, recursion, sorting, etc, all in one go :)","21,424 followers",Vladislav Zorov,1.7K,16.1K,63.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-beautiful-significant-data-structure-and-why

Stacks and queues are examples of other data structures that are derived from arrays.Here is an illustration of a straightforward size-4 array with elements (1, 2, 3 and 4).Each data element has a positive numerical value called the Index assigned to it that represents its location in the array. The majority of languages specify 0 as the array's initial index.The two varieties of arrays are as follows:arrays in one dimension (as shown above)arrays with several dimensions (arrays within arrays)Treap -The advantages of binary search trees and heaps are combined in a heap. In essence, creating a heap involves creating an ordered binary tree AND ensuring that it satisfies the ""heap"" criterion. However, if only one element is used, it will appear to be a line (because in a BST, the left child must be less than its parent and the right child must be greater than or equal to its parent, but for a heap, each parent should either be all bigger than its children or all smaller than its children)Now we utilise a random heap weight to make that second key a little more practical for us. As a result, the structure (or shape) of the tree will now totally depend on the randomised weight we assigned to the items in the heap. We generate randomised heap priorities by making sure we allocate these at random (one method is by hashing the keys themselves).You produce the priority, perform a standard BST insertion, and rotate the new key up the tree to insert it (to maintain the heap). A key can be removed by making it infinitely heavy, rotating it until it turns into a leaf on the tree (again, in heap order), and then removing it.",30 followers,Robin Thomas,5.9K,731,13.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-beautiful-significant-data-structure-and-why

Critical mission systems such as the radar, mission computers and sensors continue to evolve to match up to the mission profiles of the future.To address the capabilities needed in the air wing as early as the 2020s, Boeing has also developed the Block III Super Hornet to complement existing and future air wing capabilities. Block III is the same aircraft as Advanced Super Hornet. The Advanced F/A-18E/F Super Hornet’s multi-mission capabilities include battle-space situational awareness, counter stealth targeting, greater range and increased acceleration, improved survivability and reduced signature and room for growth.The Block III Super Hornet will come online at the same time as the F-35. In the 2020s, three Super Hornet squadrons and one F-35 squadron may form the airwing of carrier fleets. Currently, in the US Navy three out of four, and in most cases all four squadrons based off aircraft carriers, are Super Hornet squadrons.These advanced capabilities can be both built into new aircraft and incorporated into existing aircraft, allowing maximum ability to field these capabilities quickly and affordable. Block III Super Hornet is built from the same airframe as Block II, providing low risk development and maintaining the lowest operating costs of any US tactical fighter. While Boeing demonstrated advanced Super Hornet capabilities in flight in 2013, the package of upgrades has evolved to best complement F-35, EA-18G and E-2D as they will be operating together in the air wing well into the 2040s.The F/A-18 is the most modern and capable aircraft on the US Navy’s carrier decks today. In fact, the Block II Super Hornet reached initial operating capability in 2007. The F/A-18 Super Hornet was designed from day one for carrier operations and is the world’s preeminent carrier capable aircraft. It is a combat proven, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet with a defined US Navy flight plan to outpace threats into the 2040s.Boeing’s proposed ‘Make in India’ plans for the Super Hornet are not about moving a production line but rather building an entirely new and state-of-the-art production facility that can be utilised for other programmes like India’s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme.Boeing will partner with Indian industry to develop the right capabilities as efficiently and cost effectively as possible to integrate these suppliers into the global supply chain.

Furthermore, there are HUGE problems in the current formulations of physical theory, IE the Standard Model and General Relativity. I would not rule out any metaphysical possibilities personally unless there are clear concise proofs of impossibility.I did a fascinating calculation with the help of professor/astrophysicist Scott Hughes while I was a Physics undergrad at MIT: so certain molecules can act as magnetic dipoles, which want to stay aligned with any external magnetic field, and if you irradiate a magnetic dipole with RF waves at the right frequency you can perturb these dipoles and force them out of alignment with their external magnetic field. Once the RF pulse ends, the misaligned dipole begins to precess and irradiate it’s potential energy away in the form of RF waves until the dipole is again aligned with the external magnetic field. This precession rate can be calculated from the magnetic dipole strength as well as the external magnetuc field strength. This phenomenon is how Pulsed NMR (IE MRI brain scan technology) works.well it turns out you can do a similar calculaition on astrophysical scales! In GR, you can approximmate one of the terms to be an equivalent “gravito magnetic” force which arises when you have a rotation of mass. This rotation of mass creates a gravito magnetic field, and in turn any rotating mass within this field will feel a force analagous to a magnetic force.So a giant spinning disk of mass (such as a galaxy) would create a fairly strong external gravito-magnetic field.Then consider a planetary system such as the earth orbiting the sun: this circular orbital motion creates a gravito-magnetic dipole, which is immersed in an external gravitoamagnetic field due to the rotation of the galaxy. This means that if our planetary orbit is misaligned with the disk of the galaxy, then the gravito magnetic dipole (aka planetary system) will seek to be aligned with the external field, and thus will begin to precess and irradiate energy. Running the numbers, for an earth-like planet in a galaxy like ours, the precession period is about 100 times the current life of the universe.So when our verse is 100 times its current age, our planet’s orbital gravito magnetic dipole will cause the orbit to have precessed just once.So with that in mind, just imagine how much could be going on inside of an electron…",82 followers,Kyle Phoenix,649,1.4K,8.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-beautiful-significant-data-structure-and-why

They break down, when you look at things which are either, too small, or too big, or going too fast.So the laws of physics drastically change when things are extremely small, to when things are extremely big. (which is why, we still do not have the theory of everything). Now when I say, the laws of physics change, I don't really mean that nature acts differently at different scales, but what I mean is, the 'averaged out laws' are different.At sub atomic level, things are uncertain, concept like position, speed, break their meaning. Concept like path taken, and motion itself breaks down. However at macroscopic levels like the world we are living in, things appear very calm. Things don't just pop in and out of existence (like they do at the quantum level), and at the other extreme, when things are too massive or too fast, clocks tick very much different for different people (as shown quite accurately in the move Interstellar).

If you could send a projectile zipping in from across the galaxy, it would drastically change how combat is fought: stationary or slow moving fortifications would be useless, in person combat would pointless, etc etc. Until you realize that the vast majority of Hyperspace travel is done through Hyperspace lanes.These have known entry and exit points so any ships/stations outside those point would be safe from cross galaxy fire. What about smaller jumps like what Holdo did? Well luckily for the sanity of fans everywhere, the Empire already has a solution:No hyperspace for you!This no-fun-Freddy is an Interdictor, a ship designed with the express purpose of preventing ships in a significant area from entering hyperspace. So it’s already possible to tell that the suicide maneuver wasn’t particularly popular nor effective and even if itAccelerationThe second scenario presents a different challenge in that it’s a more detailed dive in what exactly happens when a ship enters hyperspace.

I have common sense.Even before I learn about writing from Sir, I know that is very important for story to follow its own rules. Who cares if dragons aren’t real, have dragons. But if you say dragon does not breath fire, cannot have dragon breath fire for no reason 100 pages later.In Star Wars hyperspace has always been other dimension thing that ship leaves universe and travels in hyperspace.

This is why Star Wars has has intdictor ship.It pulls hyperspace ship into real space with gravity because…no other way to touch hyperspace ship. yes, gravity matters to hyperspace, but Admiral Hugs ship doesn’t have enough mass to have gravity field to pull ship out of hyperspace. Indicator ship doesn’t but has special Clark space magic balls to make gravity.Of course sequel trilogy ignores completely how hyperdrive works with stupid hyperspace skipping thing and coming out in planet’s sky instead of in space.Have ever you watched Star Wars? This is not how hyperspace is.Holdo is just as dumb. There is no excuse. Is [greek phrase I cannot remember that means god has fixed things]. They even hang lamp on it to say is one in million thing to justify why only works now but cannot again because they know this breaks rules but are not smart enough or too lazy to write themselves out of corner. I have seen Sir work much harder to fix far less bad mistake in his stories.And why is so stupid? This breaks completely how hyperdrive works. Wookipedia says hyperdrive has exist for 25,000 years. If this was good idea somebody would have tried it before. Everything that can do is tried. Russia built tanks from tractor.British built some kind of gun that shoots air.Some crazy man build this.If hyperspace weapon worked after at most 2000 years everyone would be flying around with big gun to launch hyperdrive bolted to rocks. Would not waste time with death star.Maybe if whole movie revolves around revolution like Manhattan project to build and test new hyperspace bomb this makes sense. But for Holdo to just pull this out of her ass? She is not big brain scientist, she is arrogant blowhard in stupid dress.No. Lightspeed bombs changes entire nature of warfare forever.

17,"No. It’s the dumbest idea in Star Wars, violating topical canon (that is easily approachable — it’s never happened before, EVER) and abstruse canon (the deeper lore that only nerds like myself care about). The ONLY way to fix it — and this is the ONLY way I can think of — is in a future film or series, we are given some new information on Holdo: She was from a line of people (family) that have a special sixth sense that keeps them in tune with [something something something] gravitational eddies, that she’s a Force wielder or that she’s from a line of witches or something.

18,"My in-head theory (the one I use so that I don’t lose my place in the movie), goes something like this:The hyperdrive takes a ship from the normal sublight universe, and throws it into the superluminal hyperspace, all within a few milliseconds. To an outside observer, the ship appears to accelerate a fantastic amount, and disappears into the distance, but the occupants of the ship feel no such acceleration. They feel no acceleration, because the hyperdrive field encloses the whole ship, and moves it all at the same time.What the Holdo maneuver does, is activate the hyperdrive at theMy in-head theory (the one I use so that I don’t lose my place in the movie), goes something like this:The hyperdrive takes a ship from the normal sublight universe, and throws it into the superluminal hyperspace, all within a few milliseconds.
