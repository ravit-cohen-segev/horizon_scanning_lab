Hmmm. Try this:Meet Billgatus of Borg. Cover boy for Boardwatch Magazine, May 1996.At the time, completely topical. Microsoft was relentless in acquiring companies just to kill tech that competed with themselves, and forcing manufacturers to pre-load a ton of Microsoft software as part of the Windows license, and generally behaved like monopolists.By all accounts, things didn’t get much better over time, with Steve Ballmer calling Linux “a cancer” in 2001, and generally being super combative in prosecuting actual and perceived intellectual property violations not so much due to any actual financial harm done, but to preserve the hegemony.That’s the Microsoft that people are protesting. That’s the Microsoft that scares the hell out of developers who fear they will be absorbed, obliterated, or bypassed into nothingness. And where do those people live? What’s their home base? Well… as it turns out: GitHub.Now, I don’t want to conflate otherwise reasonable people who believe that Microsoft buying GitHub is the end of freedom and decency with say, Art Bell and the black helicopters or Bigfoot hunters or the incel movement. No. Wait. Who the fuck am I kidding?There are at least 18,000,000 users with 50,000,000 repositories on GitHub. Thats “that are visible”. You can’t see private repositories, where people pay GitHub a fee to let them use the familiar platform without exposing their proprietary code. We don’t know how many there are, but let’s back into this.Reports indicate that about half of the revenue - said to be about $300M ARR before the acquisition - is from GitHub Enterprise, and on-prem clone of the GitHub mothership. No clue how that stacks out in users and repos, because it’s all price on request, and has to include the license for the codebase. But it’s a lot. And that leaves about $150M, or $12.5M/month in other paid users. The rate is between $7 and $9 per user, which means there are another call it 1.5M users and no one knows how many repos. (Before you get too excited about that, odds are most if not all of these people have regular “free” GitHub accounts as well)So. Let’s see. There are at least 50M repos, on GitHub, who knows how many private and on-prem repos.And you aren’t feeling “safe” because you slept through that part where Satya has been relentlessly killing of the culture of domination and exclusion, continuing the push to have core tools on Linux, reminding everyone that Microsoft is “all in” on open source….Fine. Take your code. Leave.Here’s a complementary tinfoil hat too. Unless you’d rather have a sheet of tin foil so you can fold it yourself to make sure that it’s not “proprietary” too.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.8K,5.6K,426.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-big-of-a-deal-is-it-that-13-000-projects-left-GitHub-right-after-Microsoft-acquired-it

As we drove down the street where I live, the 1979 Me would be wondering where were all the kids? In this type of neighborhood, small houses for young couples, 2–3 bedrooms, there would have been kids out throwing the football back and forth on the street, riding bikes, and girls playing hopscotch or jumping rope. Where were they all?I would be flabbergasted to find that cars were still internal combustion. Where were all the jet powered flying cars? The rocket packs? The robot maids? The International Space Station? Was that theOn the other hand, 1979 Me would be astonished by today’s cell phones and computers and the Internet. But after a while when the novelty wore off, the 1979 Me would wonder if maybe we turned inward a little too much with our technology, instead of outward.The 1979 Me would shake my head, seeing that we learned nothing from Nixon, given the current occupant makes Nixon look like a Boy Scout. And wars in the Middle East? Did we learn nothing from Vietnam?The 1979 Me would be profoundly disappointed with the state of affairs in this world today. I was an optimist in my youth.
