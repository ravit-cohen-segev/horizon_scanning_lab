1,That’s not a good question. It’s myopic and willfully obtuse.Billionaires soaring into space isn’t being celebrated.

I won't elaborate the details for you, but there are a number of well-known sites where large number of networks happen to have infrastructure in shared facilities, and thus, tend to interconnect, because it's so damned easy. As a bonus, those facilities happen to house terminal equipment from many of the major telecom backbone providers, so you not only take out the BGP peering points, the routers that make it possible, but also the infrastructure on which it all rides.But.That won't work, because core network architects and engineers are a paranoid bunch, and realize that the default state of the Internet is ""broken"" and anything actually working is just a bonus, so there are also ""side links"" - places where you actually lease capacity from Network A to Network 3 (cough), cross country, apart from co-located interconnect points. That's not true for all networks, and it's not true for enough capacity for Netflix not to stop working, but it IS true for enough networks that you wouldn't completely break the Internet even if you blew up every well known center at which multiple network operators interconnects (and we're talking about blowing up close to 10 square miles and millions of square feet of floor space in at least a couple of cases).If you happened to have the right inside knowledge, from all of the key networks, you could probably do it.

I have just tossed your resume in the ""no"" pile and am muttering to myself about how kids like you are what's wrong with this industry and why I have to retrain every engineer I do hire. You probably think that databases are magic, too. Just throw another index in there and all your problems are solved, right?Why am I doing this? Am I just a grumpy old man who likes putting arbitrary obstacles in front of potential hires?The answer is quite the opposite, in fact. If you have studied and are a trained engineer (note how I keep using that word), you will find the interview process shockingly easy. I'm asking some amazingly simple questions like ""write FizzBuzz"" or ""is JavaScript a functional language?"" There are a few super-difficult questions in the phone screen that I don't actually expect you to get. They're there to entice you about the things you will learn working for me.So if I'm not throwing arbitrary barriers in the way, what am I doing?The answer is that I'm designing systems to provide analytic answers from petabyte scale data. Now that Google has everyone convinced that they can search the entire internet as they type, I have to provide similar performance in my web application.Accomplishing this is incredibly difficult. A simple lookup of the specs on even EMC SAN disks tells me that I don't have enough throughput. I can ask for some more expensive Infiniband hardware, but I don't work for Google. We're on a budget here. I need to find a way to take a bunch of cheap boxes and get them to perform together at interactive speeds. One super-powerful box can't do it, but maybe a bunch of IO in parallel can do it.Now all I need to do is ask my engineers to write some query code against these structu... Damn. One of them just tried to load the entire set into memory and blew the stack on the entire infrastructure. We're rolling back his code. He's saying that the code worked in his testing and he doesn't understand why it failed. I shake my head, take him to the whiteboard and explain the concept behind memory being like a data reservoir that can only hold so much. A straight pipe through (i.e. Streaming) is limited only by time (rate of data movement) rather than capacity.He says he understands and will avoid that mistake next time. Maybe he will, may he won't. The mental capacity to handle complex computational problems is rare. Many people exhibit the potential, few realize it. Especially in this world of silly ideas like ""why do I need to learn data structures and algorithms?""I may ultimately have to fire him. Which is too bad because I otherwise like him. He just can't do the job.What you need to understand is that your attitude is self-selecting you for jobs that match your ideas of what programming is. However, these are not the fun jobs nor are they the ones that pay really well. Nor are you as likely to do something truly important.If you're ok with just being a low-paid programmer and eventually exiting your profession to do something else, then don't learn algorithms and data structures. If computer science really well and truly excites you, then you know what to do.Follow upFollow upFirst off, let me thank everyone for their overwhelming interest in this post! Even those of you who were critical of its content invested in reasoned responses which has kept the dialog going. I am humbled to be at the center of such an important topic.Second, I would like to address those of you who raised concerns on the harshness of this post. When I decided to respond I wanted something more impactful than the answers that had come before. Some of the answers were very good, but none of them had a visceral connection that a young person could grab onto and understand. Much as a movie seeks to make a connection with its viewer by presenting a situation in a ""raw"" form, so was my goal with this post.Another form of concern I received was that this was a literal story. Please understand that this is only a distillation of the situations I deal with. The specific circumstances have all happened, but not in the order you see here. For example, the last time I had an engineer check in an ArrayList buffer in the middle of streaming code he was not at risk of being fired. He is actually a pretty good engineer and just wasn't thinking at the moment.His code was caught in code review and did not make it to production. I did give the training on data reservoirs to him and his colleagues to help them internalize the concept better in the hopes of preventing the same mistake again.Firing people is a difficult thing. You have to start with ""what am I doing wrong?"" and ""how can I fix the situation?"". It usually involves a long process of trying to meet the individual where they're at and finding learning styles that work for them. A lot of people are responsive to good leadership and training. Some appear to be beyond my own ability to reach.Since the focus is on trying not to hire poor fits in the first place, most of those that I have had to dismiss are poor fits for my team (i.e. social issues that don't improve) or fail to retain the things they learn over the long term. The latter situation is difficult for me as an empathetic leader because they'll appear to get better before falling back to their previous levels of performance. Thankfully it's a rare circumstance, but nevertheless poignant.I will stop here to say that some of the best engineers I ever had were those that had little experience in building scalable code but were excited by the opportunities presented to them. In some cases these individuals were more driven to learn and improve than someone who believes themselves confident in their own skills. It is far from a hard and fast rule; just an interesting observation.Third, I noticed some who argued my experience is the exception that proves the rule. To which I would point you to the section on ""self-selecting attitudes"". The reason why I often have to hire less skilled engineers is because bigger companies than mine (Google, Orbitz, NavTec, SalesForce, etc.) are sapping up these engineers as fast as they can get them. Big Data has created a MASSIVE demand for skilled engineers which has resulted in an overall deficit in the marketplace. Which is why I have to take risks in hiring and hope the training I provide is sufficient. We're all picking up the scraps that remain and hoping we can forge these hires into something impressive. That's good for software engineers, but only if you're willing to recognize that Computer Science and understanding how things work under the covers is important. Otherwise you're going to get weeded out in the phone screens and probably never understand why.Finally, some of you have expressed interest in working in the environment I described. I am hiring at the moment, so feel free to contact me if you are in the Chicago area and think you are a good fit.To give you an idea of what you'll be getting into, I work in the Healthcare Analytics space. Transactional code is easily the 95% of the industry and where most of the off the shelf libraries and software is focused. Analytics is the 5% and is thus poorly served by a handful of BI tools. Those tools tend to fall down in my industry because we care a lot about the detail of the data (i.e. the individual patients) and use summarizations as a mechanism for finding those cases rather than as an end to themselves. This creates a host of challenges that I could go on and on about for hours. Suffice it to say that you will have to understand the mind of database optimizers, you will be working on custom predicate engines at large scale, you will be developing custom OLAP logic, and you will go back and forth between being terrified about the complexity of problems and triumphant when you solve them.",436 followers,Jerason Banes,1.5K,86,700.2K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-the-billionaires-space-race-right-after-the-pandemic-is-calming-down

And his durability is enough that it can stop Supergirl dead in her tracks.• Teleportation. He can teleport himself, others or even large structures over great distances.• Size alteration. Kandor is the capital city of Krypton that's kept in a glass jar. He shrank Supergirl down to the appropriate size so thay she could walk amongst others of Kandor.• Psychic powers. For a good period of time, he had Supergirl under his thumb, making her believe that Superman was her enemy. He even showed her an altered history of Krypton. However, this power fails if extreme emotions are involved.• Telekinesis. He can move objects and people with a thought.• Time Manipulation. Apparently he can travel back in time and can even see specific events of a person's past. Furthermore, he can even travel to multiple points in time at the same. But this drains him.• Astral Projections. These are pretty cool in that they are largely intangible and won't even appear to people unless he either wants them to or if they have sufficient psychic abilities.• Through some other unknown power, he can apparently discern the genetic makeup of others.

Initially the planet has a yellow sun but then changed to a red sun while he's on the planet. So he looses his powers, he then is beaten up by a native of the planet and his clothes are stolen.

25,"No, but it isn't for the reason people have been answering so far.The planet Krypton was incredibly advanced; they had been through a lot. In both the comics, and most adaptations, Kryptonians developed cloning centuries before their destruction.While the adaptations play around with what that meant for the planet; the important thing to note is that for several centuries before its destruction, Krypton had been a clone-based society. People weren't “born”: they were made.That changed with Kal-El.Born to Jor-El and Lara, Kal-El was the first naturally conceived and naturally born Kryptonian inNo, but it isn't for the reason people have been answering so far.The planet Krypton was incredibly advanced; they had been through a lot.

People weren't “born”: they were made.That changed with Kal-El.Born to Jor-El and Lara, Kal-El was the first naturally conceived and naturally born Kryptonian in centuries. This diversity in his genome and some sort of “quality” that came from not being a farm-made person, is the reason that Superman is always more impressive than the other Kryptonians he meets.The fact that he was spared Krypton’s destruction, and grew up from his infancy under a yellow sun has done remarkable things for him, but the headstart he had from his “unnatural” natural conception gave Kal-El, AKA Clark Kent, AKA Superman, a special quality that no other Kryptonian can quite match.Hope this helps.UPDATE 3:UPDATE 2:Researching this answer again in the last few days, I've found that the canon around Kal El's conception isSo there are actually two different “canon” conceptions for Kal-El inThe Kryptonians used cloning for centuries, and eventually made their offspring in special “artificial gestation chambers”. The technology used the advances in cloning to choose the attributes needed from each “parent” and then build a new person from them.The first canon explanation for Kal-El is the one I mentioned above. Jor-El and Lara physically conceived him. They then sent him to Earth, where his cells soaked in radiation from infancy. He became an incredible specimen of his species’ potential.The second canon explanation is that he was actually birthed in a gestation chamber. Aware that the planet was doomed, Jor-El invoked a centuries-old Kryptonian law in order to take Kal-El from the chamber. Jor-El then gently caressed Lara's cheek, which was the first and last time they physically touched, as physical touching wasn't something Kryptonians did at that time. It was the first loving moment shared between two Kryptonians in centuries, as the planet exploded around them.Personally, I've always preferred the first explanation. Not only is it the one I've known longest, and therefore the one I have a bias towards, but it has a really beauty to it that the other, colder origin doesn't. The idea that Kal-El comes from love, rather than the cold science that ended his world, is also an incredibly symbolic angle to give to his origin, and makes his parents’ sacrifice that much more tragic and beautiful.While both origins work well, and give a brilliant story of love and determination on the part of his parents, the first is definitely a more “hopeful” and inspiring origin for young Kal-El, and gives his future righteousness a fatalistic undertone that the other simply doesn't.Thank you again to everyone who has taken the time to read my answer to this, and all my other answers. Superman isn't really my best subject so the answers I give for questions about him tend to require a lot more research on my part than other heroes and subjects I know by heart. Knowing that they've helped others makes it worth it.UPDATE:As pointed out in the comments, the line of El is also descended from the sun god Rao. What level of deity this makes Superman himself is unclear, but it certainly helps to make him even stronger and more unusual.I didn't originally put it into the answer because others had already mentioned that part, and the natural birth is far more unique to Kal, but it is definitely worth mentioning.It's also worth remembering that Clark was raised under a yellow sun from infancy, meaning that his cells were soaked with far more energy than any other Kryptonian from the planet itself. That also helped him rise above others of his era.These two other pieces certainly would mark him as “abnormal” compared to the rest of Krypton, but the most unique thing was still his conception, which was abnormal to literally everyone else on the planet at the time of his birth.Thanks for all the support everyone!

My phone background is unfortunately skirting the line between NSFW and SFW, and is largely unsuitable for this question, but the computer background is fair game.Given the below here,リトルナイトメア２ (Little Nightmares 2), by pasoputiSome background first.Little Nightmares 2 is a post-apocalyptic world where buildings shift and bend to an alien intelligence residing inside a mysterious tower at the center of a vast and seemingly dead city, called in official media as “the Pale City”, because not once do you see the sun. You start the game as a little boy, called Mono, the character in the foreground, waking up in a forest strewn with traps and other pitfalls. Throughout the course of the game you mostly run away from enemies that are several times your size, with the occasional exception.Accompanying Mono on his journey is a little girl he rescued from a hunter’s cabin. Together they killed the hunter who chased them both, evaded a woman with a stretchable neck and her tiny horrors, navigated a hospital of horrors and incinerated its obese practitioner of malpractice, and avoided shambling zombies who largely ignore them… unless you interfere with their televisions.Then, suddenly, a tall man in a hat appears. He takes Mono’s friend, and so Mono goes to get her back. Along the way he is chased by this tall man in the hat. Finally, Mono has no other choice but to stand in the rain, where looming in the distance is the cursed tower transmitting its signal throughout the city. And then the tall man you see in the background of that picture appears.Most of what I’ve said here is largely abbreviated and/or truncated to avoid spoiling you about the game. There’s no dialogue, no in-game books or computer terminals to glean information from, just the music, the immersive atmosphere, and the unnerving sensation that you areBut in that particular scene, Mono has his back to the figurative wall. So what does he do? Well, it turns out he has powers of a sort. The tall man, known officially as the Broadcaster but universally called “the Thin Man” by the fandom, also has powers. The combat sequence that appears shortly after the above scene occurs is them trying to overcome one another’s defenses. Mono is pushing back the Broadcaster, who is unnaturally bending over to grab you. And each time you successfully repel it, such a shockwave of power erupts that the buildings all around recoil and shiver, momentarily straightening up, before returning back to their original position — like a field of concrete grasses bowing down before a supernatural breeze.Once Mono defeats the Broadcaster, he reaches out, takes hold of something in the air, and physically draws the tower right to him, compressing or readjusting reality around him to accomplish such a feat. The tower then opens its doors, and he enters, ready to save his friend.But that’s not all.Ready for it?It turns out that Mono and the Broadcaster share the exact same powers because, in a way, they are the same person. And those powers are tied to the transmissions that evil tower is using to hold, in thrall, that entire city. All of those zombies absorbed by television? Willing consumers of whatever fantasies the tower, or the Broadcaster, feeds them.How are Mono and the Broadcaster the same person? Well, play the game to find out.So, with either Mono or the Broadcaster — or both, because the fandom loves to be fluffy and wholesome — by my side, I’m safe from any zombies. The Broadcaster can teleport and slow down time and everything around him. Mono, meanwhile, is tenacious and has demonstrated aptitude with a variety of improvised weapons — axes, hammers, a piece of pipe — and a knowledge of how to solve puzzles. I’m fairly certain I’m safe.
