You have to be an engineering/medical degree holder before pursuing what you really want. That is some sheer wastage of human resource, isn’t it? Likewise neither all streams are equal. It makes no sense that to take science( PCM/B) after 10th class, you have to score above 80+ while if youscore less than 55%, Arts remains the only door open for you. It only shows the herd mentality/prejudice that persists in society about subjects and professions.2) Everything is about rote memorization, leading to behaviour which encourages cramming and forgetting rather than life long learning.3) Standardized testing determines everything, and aptitude of students is not recognized outside this formatBihar topper thinks Political Science is Prodigal Science and related to cooking:She claimed to be Bihar State exam topper, but she cant even pronounce ‘Political Science’ in a press interview4) Lack of diversity in the subjects you can take in college (e.g. can't double major in Math and German like you can in the USA)5) Extreme pressure from parents / society to use education for financial security = CSE degrees for programming jobs or medicine. Societal pressure to get into the ""right schools"", not only for the education aspect but to ensure good job/ marriage prospects, in general success in life. Little incentive to take risks and follow own interests or encourage creativity. Generally conformist culture, which makes educational achievement the only thing that matters to social standing.6) Additional extreme pressure due to limited seats resulting in very intense competition between students.7) Reservation system8) Management quota system9) Government control of education/ Government Monopoly in education.10) Right to Education Act.11) Education sector is closed to for-profit organizations.12) Few opportunities and flexibility to cross over into different streams of education.MOST IMPORTANT NOT USING ERP oR MAKING IT BY THEM OWN…Education ERP software is a web based ERP software solution is to streamline and manage student information efficiently along with automating processes for the Stakeholders, It help students, teachers, parents and the school administrative staff to use school data in a more organized and structured manner.1. Complete visibility into all the important processes, across various departments of an organization (especially for senior management personnel).2. Automatic and coherent workflow from one department/function to another, to ensure a smooth transition and quicker completion of processes. This also ensures that all the inter-departmental activities are properly tracked and none of them is ‘missed out’.3. A unified and single reporting system to analyze the statistics/status etc. in real-time, across all functions/departments.4. Since same (ERP) software is now used across all departments, individual departments having to buy and maintain their own software systems is no longer necessary.5. Certain ERP vendors like SMPL can extend their ERP systems to provide Business Intelligence functionalities, that can give overall insights on business processes and identify potential areas of problems/improvements.6. Advanced e-commerce integration is possible with ERP systems – most of them can handle web-based order tracking/ processing.7. There are various modules in an ERP system like Finance/Accounts, Human Resource Management, Manufacturing, Marketing/Sales, Supply Chain/Warehouse Management, CRM, Project Management, etcSollutionRote learningYes, we do know that many IB schools across India are trying to bring in interactive education and we laud that immensely. But the evil ofWe’re very sure that most students won’t be clear about many of the basic foundation concepts taught in school even after they’ve graduated.Make the Teachers feel worthy, pay them more:The academic curriculum board, in most cases is filled with people above their 60’s and 70’s. With all due respect to them, I strongly feel that you need a bunch of younger professors in there to have that mix of experience and youth in the system. The younger ones would be more in sync, more in line with the technological changes and the new age needs of the students in their years to come. The fact, however, is that most of the younger professors are either outcasts (from the IT factory) or are doing this job because they don’t have better things to do. Very few among the young are actually in teaching for the sake of teaching. The point is very simple; they are paid pittens in comparison with the rest. A graduating student earns more in an IT company than what a Lecturer or even a Assistant Professor earns in some colleges (despite the 6th Pay commission increase which covers only on the Government colleges). Once you start paying more, you get quality faculty in, you get people who actually want to teach and people who are worth the caliber of teaching. After this, you will have a scenario where you have quality young people who can actually give the 60’s and 70’s in the curriculum boards a run for their money and there wouldn’t be any excuses. So where would the money come in from?Industry Interaction a Placement Obligation:One of the key pillars in growth in education is the level of industry interaction with the students. Companies should be sought out for such interactions, if they don’t agree to it, then the universities should use their advantage. When companies come for placements, there should be a basic qualification criteria for their eligibility for the placements. For example, they should have contributed investment worth 2 to 4 lakhs (just example, this can vary up or down) in R and D with the university to be eligible to come to placement. Most of the companies would fall in line automatically since for them human capital is much more important than these meager sums of money. You think any IT company would care about a few lakhs when they are recruiting 600 to 1000 people? When you provide so much human(s) capital you think they would ignore it? Not a chance, this would make the university utilize its human potential to the hilt and also enhance its industry interaction numbers significantly. Eventually, this investment would enhance the learning experience of the student and make him want to give back to the institutes more once that person graduatesUse the power of the Alumni:One of the most underrated potentials in Indian education system is the power of the Alumni. Barring the IIT’s and few other top institutes, the concept of Alumni networking is nonexistent. In an era where every Indian graduating is earning somewhere, alumni networks need to be very well intertwined with the university affairs. Alumni are very eager to give; just that a) they don’t know who to give b) they are worried about where the money would go. Once you establish a credible network which is transparent, it would give the avenue as well as the confidence for the alumni to contribute in terms of money or academic expertiseAll of the above are just mere suggestions to tackle system that has numerous issues. These suggestions might not break the deadlock or create a revolution by any means but it can be something that can be incorporated. These suggestions might not be relevant to some. These suggestions might also sound farfetched but if it at least one of them adds value somewhere to the education system, then it’s worth itMarking SystemAll the other evils of the Indian education system ultimately come down to the method in which students are marked.Is it justified that a student is evaluated only on the basis of his/her performance for the duration of three hours of the exam? If the axis of grading and marking is shifted to classroom participation, project work, communication and leadership skills and extracurricular performance, only then will a genuine student shine out.This might sound like a utopian proposition but the Indian education system badly needs to bring about this change.Respect for all streams“Oh has she done a MA in English? She’ll end up becoming a teacher”“What good is a diploma in hospitality management? It ultimately means doing a job in a hotel as a cook right?”If you’ve heard these lines time and again from you elders, don’t you think it’s time you stop them?How long are we going to look down upon vocational streams and look up to medicine, engineering, IIM and I IT Students at the school level need to be educated through career counseling regarding the kind of streams that exist and what importance each of them plays to make an economy diverse.Variety in education streamsWhy do we always see students being envious of their counterparts in the USA?It’s because there are just three options that student have after Class 10 – they’re stuck with Science, Arts or Commerce. If they’re not good enough for either of these, they jet set straight into diplomas and certificate courses. Don’t you think the Indian education system needs to introduce combination courses in which students can opt for a major and a minor subject? If students in America can pursue Physiotherapy with Art History and Biological Science with Photography,Make the Private Institutes for profit, not non-profit:This might sound like a ludicrous suggestion but if you think about it, it might make some sense. We all know that private colleges make money and they are run as large businesses. The solution, I feel, lies in making them take away the non profit status and make them competitive. Make them under direct competition with each other so that they can get fight it out openly rather that doing so under the carpet. We cant follow the English education system and yet sit in our holy grail of non profit, can we? Education is a business in some form, the more we hide behind it, and the more corruption would step in. If Educational institutes are using this business to improve their system, then let them do it, that’s how world class universities abroad work and that’s how we should work if we follow the colonial system. The best way forward is to make them “for” profit, taxable and it would increase capital for them as well as increase transparency for us.The system of tuition classesCommenting on this subject is like plunging one’s hand into a vicious cycle which seems to have no beginning or end. Reasons for tuition classes mushrooming are because students say that the teaching in schools is lax and not good enough for them to clear exams. Whereas teachers say that students jump ahead many chapters in the tuition classes before they are even taught in school.Although the picture does seem dismal, there is hope because some of these changes are slowly being made by select education providers. But how quickly will these changes percolate down to common man in India, only time will tell.Class 10thThe main focus should be that, when a student reaches class 10th, he has enough knowledge of all the fields to figure out the subjects he needs to take in class 11th and the classes/clubs he needs to join in case he is in fields like sports/singing/dancing/painting etc. For this, a large part of our existing system should remain same, with some major changes in its execution.Higher Education changesI would just like to give some statistics.I would like to take back current reservation system on caste basis and gender basis and would give the reservation to people who are BPL ( below poverty line) and who are not capable of getting education. I would give free education to those in need and who are helpless.Due to this reservation India is still developing and will always remain in developing countries. With reservation India can't be developed country.I would force student to know about India instead of knowing about Britishers. What I mean to say is I will change history books.Education has been a problem in our country and lack of it has been blamed for all sorts of evil for hundreds of years. Even Rabindranath Tagore wrote lengthy articles about how Indian education system needs to change. Funny thing is that from the colonial times, few things have changed. We have established IITs, IIMs, law schools and other institutions of excellence; students now routinely score 90% marks so that even students with 90+ percentage find it difficult to get into the colleges of their choice; but we do more of the same old stuff.Rote learning still plagues our system, students study only to score marks in exams, and sometimes to crack exams like IIT JEE, AIIMS or CLAT. The colonial masters introduced education systems in India to create clerks and civil servants, and we have not deviated much from that pattern till today. If once the youngsters prepared en masse for civil services and bank officers exams, they now prepare to become engineers. If there are a few centres of educational excellence, for each of those there are thousands of mediocre and terrible schools, colleges and now even universities that do not meet even minimum standards. If things have changed a little bit somewhere, elsewhere things have sunk into further inertia, corruption and lack of ambition.Creating a few more schools or allowing hundreds of colleges and private universities to mushroom is not going to solve the crisis of education in India. And a crisis it is – we are in a country where people are spending their parent’s life savings and borrowed money on education – and even then not getting standard education, and struggling to find employment of their choice. In this country, millions of students are victim of an unrealistic, pointless, mindless rat race. The mind numbing competition and rote learning do not only crush the creativity and originality of millions of Indian students every year, it also drives brilliant students to commit suicide.We also live in a country where the people see education as the means of climbing the social and economic ladder. If the education system is failing – then it is certainly not due to lack of demand for good education, or because a market for education does not exist.Education system in India is failing because of more intrinsic reasons. There are systemic faults that do not let our demand for good education translate into a great marketplace with excellent education services.Focus on skill based educationOur education system is geared towards teaching and testing knowledge at every level as opposed to teaching skills. “Give a man a fish and you feed him one day, teach him how to catch fishes and you feed him for a lifetime.” I believe that if you teach a man a skill, you enable him for a lifetime. Knowledge is largely forgotten after the semester exam is over. Still, year after year Indian students focus on cramming information. The best crammers are rewarded by the system. This is one of the fundamental flaws of our education system.Reward creativity, original thinking, research and innovationOur education system rarely rewards what deserves highest academic accolades. Deviance is discouraged. Risk taking is mocked. Our testing and marking systems need to be built to recognize original contributions, in form of creativity, problem solving, valuable original research and innovation. If we could do this successfully Indian education system would have changed overnight.Memorising is no learning; the biggest flaw in our education system is perhaps that it incentivizes memorizing above originality.Get smarter people to teachFor way too long teaching became the sanctuary of the incompetent. Teaching jobs are until today widely regarded as safe, well-paying, risk-free and low-pressure jobs. Once a teacher told me in high school “Well, if you guys don’t study it is entirely your loss – I will get my salary at the end of the month anyway.” He could not put across the lack of incentive for being good at teaching any better. Thousands of terrible teachers all over India are wasting valuable time of young children every day all over India.Education for allIt is high time to encourage a breed of superstar teachers. The internet has created this possibility – the performance of a teacher now need not be restricted to a small classroom. Now the performance of a teacher can be opened up for the world to see. The better teacher will be more popular, and acquire more students. That’s the way of the future.We need leaders, entrepreneurs in teaching positions, not salaried people trying to hold on to their mantle.Implement massive technology infrastructure for educationIndia needs to embrace internet and technology if it has to teach all of its huge population, the majority of which is located in remote villages. Now that we have computers and internet, it makes sense to invest in technological infrastructure that will make access to knowledge easier than ever. Instead of focussing on outdated models of brick and mortar colleges and universities, we need to create educational delivery mechanisms that can actually take the wealth of human knowledge to the masses. The tools for this dissemination will be cheap smartphones, tablets and computers with high speed internet connection. While all these are becoming more possible than ever before, there is lot of innovation yet to take place in this space.Re-define the purpose of the education systemOur education system is still a colonial education system geared towards generating babus and pen-pushers under the newly acquired skin of modernity. We may have the most number of engineering graduates in the world, but that certainly has not translated into much technological innovation here. Rather, we are busy running the call centres of the rest of the world – that is where our engineering skills end.The goal of our new education system should be to create entrepreneurs, innovators, artists, scientists, thinkers and writers who can establish the foundation of a knowledge based economy rather than the low-quality service provider nation that we are turning into.Effective deregulationUntil today, an institute of higher education in India must be operating on a not-for profit basis. This is discouraging for entrepreneurs and innovators who could have worked in these spaces. On the other hand, many people are using education institutions to hide their black money, and often earning a hefty income from education business through clever structuring and therefore bypassing the rule with respect to not earning profit from recognized educational institutions. As a matter of fact, private equity companies have been investing in some education service provider companies which in turn provide services to not-for-profit educational institutions and earn enviable profits. Sometimes these institutes are so costly that they are outside the rich of most Indian students.There is an urgent need for effective de-regulation of Indian education sector so that there is infusion of sufficient capital and those who provide or create extraordinary educational products or services are adequately rewarded.Take mediocrity out of the systemOur education system today encourages mediocrity – in students, in teachers, throughout the system. It is easy to survive as a mediocre student, or a mediocre teacher in an educational institution. No one shuts down a mediocre college or mediocre school. Hard work is always tough, the path to excellence is fraught with difficulties. Mediocrity is comfortable. Our education system will remain sub-par or mediocre until we make it clear that it is not ok to be mediocre. If we want excellence, mediocrity cannot be tolerated. Mediocrity has to be discarded as an option. Life of those who are mediocre must be made difficult so that excellencePersonalize education – one size does not fit allAssembly line education prepares assembly line workers. However, the drift of economic world is away from assembly line production. Indian education system is built on the presumption that if something is good for one kid, it is good for all kids.Some kids learn faster, some are comparatively slow. Some people are visual learners, others are auditory learners, and still some others learn faster from experience. If one massive monolithic education system has to provide education to everyone, then there is no option but to assume that one size fits all. If however, we can effectively decentralize education, and if the government did not obsessively control what would be the “syllabus” andwhat will be the method of instruction, there could be an explosion of new and innovative courses geared towards serving various niches of learners,Take for example, the market for learning dancing. There are very different dance forms that attract students with different tastes. More importantly, different teachers and institutes have developed different ways of teaching dancing. This could never happen if there was a central board of dancing education which enforced strict standards of what will be taught and how such things are to be taught.Central regulation kills choice, and stifles innovation too. As far as education is concerned, availability of choices, de-regulation, profitability, entrepreneurship and emergence of niche courses are all inter-connected.Allow private capital in educationThe government cannot afford to provide higher education to all the people in the country. It is too costly for the government to do so. The central government spends about 4% of budget expenditure on education, compared to 40% on defence. Historically, the government just did not have enough money to spend on even opening new schools and universities, forget overhauling the entire system and investing in technology and innovation related to the education system. Still, until today, at least on paper only non-profit organizations are allowed to run educational institutions apart from government institutions. Naturally, the good money, coming from honest investors who want to earn from honest but high impact businesses do not get into education sector. Rather, there are crooks, money launderers and politicians opening “private” educational institutions which extract money from the educational institution through creative structuring. The focus is on marketing rather than innovation or providing great educational service – one of the major examples of this being IIPM.Allowing profit making will encourage serious entrepreneurs, innovators and investors to take interest in the education sector. The government does not have enough money to provide higher education of reasonable quality to all of us, and it has no excuse to prevent private capital from coming into the educational sector.Make reservation irrelevantWe have reservation in education today because education is not available universally. Education has to be rationed. This is not a long –term solution. If we want to emerge as a country build on a knowledge economy, driven by highly educated people – we need to make good education so universally available that reservation will lose its meaning",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,2.3K,5.6K,426.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-the-Indian-education-system-encourage-passion-for-learning-subjects-rather-than-focusing-on-rote-learning-Does-the-Indian-education-system-promote-rote-learning-at-the-expense-of-critical-thinking-ingenuity-and-life-long-learning

So we have a human who is not entirely free, social chains and baggage keep him bound and they pressurize him/her to follow a certain track. And it takes a lot of courage to break that system and it rarely ends up in a good situation.3. Spoon FeedingI believe Indians are always provided with the answer and never encouraged to find out - one big difference between Indian education system and say it's US counterpart. So even if we have the brains, we don't have enough hunger to find out and explore and clearly the latter makes a difference. US heads employing Indians, cause the former had hunger and the latter the ability to just do what is told. That is something that I personally believe is a result of constant spoon feeding.4.

MBA programs are first and foremost an investment from which you should expect to reap the benefits throughout your career – not just the immediate future.So, read on if you’re interested in six ways doing an MBA willMBA graduates tend to enjoy a very specific set of ‘soft’ skills, including interpersonal skills, leadership and corporate responsibility. Thanks to their soft skills, MBAs with a few years of working experience behind them continue to outshine their competitors during job interviews. With more to bring to the table than their technical expertise and academic achievements, MBA graduates get snapped by employers, who are very much aware that leadership is part of the MBA value proposition.2.MBA can help you explore your hidden potential and help you develop leadership skills. Team management, strategic thinking, positive attitude, and confidence are some of the soft skills that are most commonly associated with good leaders. These skills are required for every professional in a managerial role in order for him to lead and manage his team and carry out the task efficiently. MBA coursework is designed to teach soft skills to bring out your leadership skills to the forefront.3.A degree in management can make you an efficient communicator. One of the primary objectives of an MBA program is to teach you through classroom interactions and presentations to express your ideas more clearly and distinctly. Communication is an art and practice can make you perfect. Good communication skills can help you build better relationships with your co-workers and employees, communicate your goals coherently and ideas more distinctly. It can even prove invaluable in your personal life.4. Develop New PerspectivesDoing an MBA can give you the opportunity to discuss business trends with your classmates and faculty. Open– ended discussions and interactions with other well- informed people is most likely to provide you new perspectives and enrich your knowledge.

I was a lazy fat shit. I was destroying my life, my body and had become underconfident and didn't really prefer going out of my comfort zone.At this point of time, I had started believing that this is how I'm gonna live all my life, but there was this feeling which was nagging me, the worst feeling that you can probably ever get.The feeling of self loathing.And just one random day, I thought let's give it a try. I didn't have anything to lose anyway.So I searched a bit about fat loss on the internet and made this.A little plan. Not something tough.But what was difficult was following it everyday without any excuses. I still remember a guy came into my room and laughed at this and said it's no use doing this and I'll always be like this.After a little more time, I understood that mocking and discouragement was a part of this.Managing everything was very difficult. I couldn't divide my time properly and I missed deadlines.After around 2 months, there wasn't much difference in my body but I could see that I was more attentive, more active and a little more disciplined.Then came running. Which has become my absolute favourite right now.I ran in my campus. I used to go out of breath in around 500–800 metres or so. Now I can run 10kms.Fast forward two more months.I started lifting. Ordered some dumbbell sets from Amazon. Started studying about fitness. Made notes. Started to count calories.I studied about a particular diet or a workout regime before implementing it on me.While buying stuff from market, I used to see the caloric contents rather than the price tag.And some people had started telling me that I looked a bit slim. It felt nice.I could see my muscles and biceps taking shape. It felt amazing and that I could also have a nice physique. And then I understood; that I can also look good. :pIt had become my daily routine to workout and go for a run. There was no room for junk or sugary foods. I ate vegetables, eggs, paneer and oats and had regular protein shakes.I was strong. Like really strong. I extremely rarely skipped my workout or cheated on my diet.I had that discipline and I was proud of that. And still am. It was not easy.And after all this.I became this guy.It is good to live like this. People don't understand that they are destroying their lives by drinking, smoking all that. It's not cool.What's cool is to not indulge in that useless shit and live a healthy and a thriving life.Right now I stand at 6 ft and weigh around 85 kgs.Losing more than 25 kg was probably one of the toughest things in my life. But it changed me in a way I cannot imagine.There is no trace of underconfidence or self loathing left now. I understand discipline and know how to manage my time without disturbing other things.I can talk to a stranger for an hour without feeling weird or scared. It's fun to step outside now.This was me last week getting bored.So.I think I did ok. :P",0 followers,Kathy Pennell,24.2K,2K,42.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-the-Indian-education-system-encourage-passion-for-learning-subjects-rather-than-focusing-on-rote-learning-Does-the-Indian-education-system-promote-rote-learning-at-the-expense-of-critical-thinking-ingenuity-and-life-long-learning

I’ll be back in ten minutes.”I’d like to say it was a choice, but for us it was no choice at all. The picture of our boys was still up on the screen. The printouts were in our hands. At 18 weeks you can see the outline of their faces. You can see the shape of a hand as it caresses a cheek, our son’s cheek. I know that shape. I’ve been watching it for days now.She has felt the impression of that hand for far longer.She is sobbing, we both are. We are holding each other. She is looking at her stomach.“Did you decide?”She looks up at him with steel in her eyes.We have never been more certain.EDIT: figured I'd share a picture of the results of our choiceEDIT 2I’d just like to thank you all for sharing your own stories. I've read each of the comments and am moved by the responses written there. Several people have asked for an update, so here goes:We went with the surgery. There were complications. Brooke ended up in the hospital on strict bed rest for 6 weeks. We tried everything we could to keep those boys in there but they were born early (24 weeks) anyway. The next 6 months were a nightmare. Maybe someday I’ll write about that too but like Churchill said, “When you’re going through Hell, keep going.”There are and will be lifelong repercussions to the choice we made. Baby A (our little Jayden) has Epilepsy, Cerebral Palsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder. He takes this in stride and I am awed by his grace some days. Other days I want to crawl into a cave. Our boys are doing great but they will always have challenges that were dictated by the circumstances of their birth. Having said that, I’ve never regretted our choice, even for a second. And if I could go back, with full knowledge, I would make the same choice happily and wait with open arms for the chance to smile at their little faces for the first time again.","56,831 followers",Flavian Mwasi,3.9K,677,73M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-of-an-MBA-after-getting-a-B-Tech-in-mechanical-engineering

She took me into the kitchen where she prepared hot chocolate and cookies then waited.About halfway through my hot chocolate, I said. “I thought this girl at school liked me, but I don’t think she does. She said something mean to me today.” I let that sink in then added the punch line. “I don’t think anyone at school likes me.”Grandma listened patiently while she sipped her coffee. When she replaced the cup on the saucer, I knew she was going to give me her sage advice.“Totty,” Grandma often called me Totty instead of Kathy. “Totty, a few people will really like me and be my friend. There may be one or two people who may not like me. But the vast majority of people won’t care one way or the other about me. They may say hello and notice what I’m wearing. But as soon as I’m out of sight, they will forget me entirely.”Even at 11, I understood what she meant. Some people will really like you. One or two won’t like you. But the vast majority of people don’t care about you one way or the other. It’s just human nature. So the idea that everyone doesn’t like you is false.Just because someone walks past you and doesn’t speak, it doesn’t mean they don’t like you. It may mean they’re preoccupied. Sometimes, people may be a bit snippy with you. If you have done nothing wrong, then they are taking their bad day out on you and it has nothing to do with your personally.I’ve tried to remember that when something unpleasant happens. If I’ve done nothing to warrant someone being a bit sharp with me, then I chalk it up to something that’s happened to them which has nothing to do with me.",4 followers,Shiraz Shrestha,15.7K,59,1.1M,https://www.quora.com/Does-an-MBA-really-change-ones-life

Came back after 45 mins. I took a shower and got dressed.I sat down in a corner of my house, closed my eyes, and started focusing on my breaths. I sat there in complete silence and tried to observe my thoughts.I saw the utter chaos my mind was experiencing. I was worried about every small thing in the world. I felt like I was in the middle of a battleground.I tried to trace back the origin of every thought and find out why I was thinking this way.When I opened my eyes, I was it was only 5 mins but it felt like an hour.I felt good. I had taken the first step.It’s been 7 days now, and I want to say that meditation didn’t solve any of my problems. In fact, it has no relation to the things I was going through.But, it is helping stay calm in tense situations and think from multiple perspectives. I am having better sleep and I am able to focus my energy on things that matter the most.The morning ritual is helping me a lot.When I wake up at 5 am and go for a run, and I see almost no one the roads, I feel I am ahead. When I come back, take shower, meditate and have a mega breakfast, I feel I have conquered the world. I feel I am pumped up to take every challenge that comes on my way during the day and determined to complete whatever I decide to do.By the time I leave for work, I feel I have done which I was struggling to do all my life.

If they conduct more industrial visits, more life changing seminars, give them more practical knowledge so maybe they meet the requirements needed by the companies.So in my opinion MBA is just an another course which gives you a status symbol so that your parents & relative can say proudly that my son/daughter has done MBA from this & that university.But if u really want to do MBA then try to get in IIM's, Symbosis, XLRI, FMS, MDI gurgoan etc they gives thier students more case studies, focus on more practical knowledge and provide you more specialised courses & at last you will get high paying job from these institutes.","2,730 followers",Victoria Zorzoli,1.2K,77,3.2M,https://www.quora.com/Does-an-MBA-really-change-ones-life

I had a 4.0 college GPA, two internships at highly venerated Los Angeles museums, great recommendations from my professors, as well as a published thesis paper.

There was only one more step between me and my boss, and if something happened to my boss, I would be the boss, supervising an entire department…Then I would reach the echelons of power, traveling to Switzerland, USA, UK, and South Africa on business trips, and rubbing shoulders with the high and mighty. The rest of Africa would be too small for me. I wanted more. I was ambitious. My salary alone, was what most people would only dream about today—a decent amount with benefits and the luxury of buying any car I wanted. Actually I had two cars, so my societal standing was also high.What else did I want?Then the shake-up began. My boss was swept away. Several of my colleagues were swept away. Except me. Because I was a key employee, in a key department. They said I was not dispensable—yet. Some of my colleagues were weeping like babies on receiving their terminal letters informing them that their services were no longer needed. The company was running losses and bleeding cash, so the only way to stay afloat, was to “throw some baggage off the ship”.My colleagues were not weeping because of losing their jobs. They were weeping because a company they had worked for, their entire adult lives and helped to build, was now no longer interested in them. Some of them had worked there for decades, straight from high school or college, so they didn’t know where else to go. The atmosphere was reminiscent of a funeral.I felt sorry for them, but I also felt sorry for myself, because I didn’t have much in terms of market skills, or qualifications to sell to the outside world, except my experience. I felt vulnerable. Probably the next wave would sweep me too, or so I thought…I thought now that my former boss was no longer in employment, I would automatically be promoted to occupy the position I had been eyeing for quite a while. I was wrong.What I didn’t know was that the corporation had its own mind. Out of nowhere, they had already found a replacement, even before my former boss was laid off. In fact, the replacement was someone less qualified and less experienced than myself. No, I was no politician, but corporate politics and corruption had ensured that I was rigged out.I was disappointed, but what else could I have done? I needed the job. I consoled myself by believing that I was indispensable — at least for now.That’s how I learned the importance of creating your own ladder as the only way to wield power.Many times, I contemplated changing my career, because I had learned that some careers were paying quite well. But that would require going back to school, wasting more time, not to mention the time wastage. Furthermore, by this time, I had a young family, which could further surfer the consequences.Never underestimate the power of divine connection. The following year, in 2004, I met a friend who introduced me to the idea of starting a business. I had never done business before, and although I had studied something like that in accounting school, I didn’t think that was for me.When she noticed my naivety in that area, she suggested that since I was risk-averse and had some money, I could start small by investing small amounts of money in a lower risk regime like the stock market, where you could just give the money to your stock broker, with some instructions, and then lay low and wait for your profits.She also suggested I read a book calledThe first week of trading at the stock market I was lucky. I made more money in a week than I had made in a month in my entire life. Next time I wasn’t so lucky. I went on a losing streak. It was a roller coaster ride — sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I realized I had actually taken to something akin to gambling. And I wasn’t getting any good at it.It was an adventure, but I wanted something that didn’t look like gambling. I wanted something I could predict reliably. What I was doing was stock trading— not investing.But that’s not even what changed my life.Rich Dad, Poor DadRead books on entire subjects about money, business, entrepreneurship, and personal development. Understand how money works, but more importantly, understand yourself by reading mind transformation books.Develop a reading habit.On September 30, 2004, I tendered my resignation and joined the jobless, without a particular plan in mind. I just wanted out. I discovered if the corporation regarded me as an indispensable employee, then perhaps I could be more valuable elsewhere.I still had my knowledge at the stock market and Robert Kiyosaki as my mentor.The dot-com bubble had just come and bust as fast as it came in the early 2000s, and I realized I didn’t know much about the Internet let alone web development. But I knew this new technology was not going away. The Internet fascinated me, as the Personal Computer had fascinated me in the 90s.So, armed with the new-found knowledge from my friend Robert Kiyosaki, I began a new career in web development—learning HTML, CSS, CGI, Java, JSP, ASP, and JavaScript. I later developed other server-side web skills and became a full-stack developer.You should have seen me the day I developed my first web app. I was jumping up and down, and beaming with happiness from mouth-to-mouth like a fool— but I didn’t care. I had just launched a new career in the world-wide-web.Those were the days. I went on to read as many other books as possible; technology books, self-help books, psychology books, business books, entrepreneurial books, and personal development books.I also realized that the more books I read, the more I developed personally, the better I became at everything, especially in business and communication skills, the better I became at helping other people, and the more money I made.As they say, the rest is history. With my newly-acquired habit of reading, I was able to secure my freedom — financial freedom, time freedom, and location freedom.On Quora, I have reached nearly 44 million people most of whom have sent me congratulatory messages thanking me for changing their lives.Although I might have forgotten something, you can catch most of my books, writings, and resources for personal development, in my profile.What I can say about my own personal development journey is that, my mind change can be attributed to reading a simple book you can buy in the street.Books are powerful tools that can change your life forever, if you take to reading. They can change your love life, business life, social life, career life, social life, mindset, health, and spiritual life. They can even transform your financial life.I know because they transformed me.Further Reading:What if You Could Hack Your Brain to Get or Achieve What You Want in Life?…The writer is an entrepreneur, personal development coach, life coach, and mentor.",301 followers,Rohan Monga,10.2K,530,18.4M,https://www.quora.com/Does-an-MBA-really-change-ones-life

It’s in what you are receptive to. It’s in the moment being just right. It’s in what you need to see or hear.Learning is not in the lesson.

End result - you are one more in the army of the over-educated and the under-inspired.The true value of a business school is not in the academic knowledge it imparts but in the network you build while you are at the school. Building that network requires an equivalent level of give and take. You share your life experiences - from growing up within a certain culture to your personal interests and pursuits to your professional successes and failures - and get the same from your student community. As a recent undergraduate, quite honestly, you usually don't have that much to share, particularly on the professional front. Imagine for a second that all your classmates are exactly like you - what are you going to gain from them in a business school that you didn't in college already? Let's say they aren't like you and come in with 3-6 years of working, starting companies, military experience...how will you relate to these experiences with none of your own?Get out there, work at a large firm or a small one, experiment with your ideas and start your own company, learn some life lessons outside of your books. You'll know when you are ready to go to business school (if ever) when progress in your career appears to need it.","72,224 followers",Rohan Kamath,2.7K,213,29.3M,https://www.quora.com/Does-an-MBA-really-change-ones-life

You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?I have got a lot of accusations, of being money minded, this and that in the PMs in Quora.This is an answer to everyone, an answer which would describe my thought process in taking this particular decision.Before, starting with that, let us understand the structure of the Government’s Bureaucracy. That will help us have more clarity, in understanding my decision.The Government is divided into Levels, according to the 7th Central Pay Commission. There are totally 18 levels, with 03 entry points.Level 01 - 05 - Lower ServicesLevel 06 - 09 - Middle ServicesLevel 10 - 18 -Now, I have always aspired for the upper civil services, usually conducted by the UPSC, which deals with the upper management of the Government.This is where most of the “thinking” is done, this is where policies are “ideated” and this is where public policies are “drafted”.An IAS joins at Level 09 during training, and then starts off from Level 10, and has the possibility of having more than 07 promotions in his career of 35 years.This is where I wanted to be, join the bureaucracy, and then rise high enough to shape the policy-making. (Usually around Level 13 or so)Now, I have been working with the MHA for the last two years, at Level 07.This is the middle management services.This is where the policies which areWorking in rural Bihar for the last 02 years, I have understood the exact ground realities, of where exactly it is going wrong, and how the policy drafting needs a bit change, by someone who has actual on-ground realistic experiences.But, a Level 07 employee can grow upto max of Level 10 or 11, where you start competing with junior IAS officers when you are about to retire. (Example Promoted SP vs IPS SP)So, in a span of 35 years, I will get only 3–5 promotions, and that too will be still stuck in middle management, and never reach the “ideation” and “policy-drafting” stages.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” now? Which is where I really want to be.I am not able to clear the UPSC exam. I have tried.I am stuck in middle management, away from home, with an unstable life, mediocre salary, erratic transfers and postings, very few promotions and very slow career growth and strained personal relationships.If I get married to anyone soon, she would want to work in a city, which would again increase long distance and put more strain on the family.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” considering all these factors?The answer came here -And this privatization of the Government by bringing in external specialists is going to increase a lot in the next two decades or so.And they are getting Joint Secretary posts directly, which is a Level 15 post. A direct jump from Level 07 to Level 15, and if I stay I would retire by Level 10.I had to think.I had a plan.A long-term plan, with lots of risks and possibilities of failing.Get into the corporate sector.The lateral entry needs 15 years of total work-ex. I already have 05 years work-ex (Startup, Sabre and MHA)I need to work for 10 years, a decade in the corporate sector, after which I can make a shift to upper civil services - Level 15 in a very short time.And I have seen the 6000 applicants - Some are good, some are okay, not that stellar - I know my work ex in the Central Government in rural Bihar would stand out and would get a chance to interview for the Joint Secretary posts - This is 10 years later I am talking about - 2030 - When I am around 38 years old.So, how do I jump into the corporate sector?Some private job which deals with Public Policy or Development Consultancy or Social Impact or Public Administration jobs ?Also, I need a post-graduation, ensuring all the educational qualifications are in place.So, I made a list of colleges/schools/institutes which would get me a Post Grad and a job in the public policy sector domain.And I wanted to apply for Indian schools only - Not, US, UK, Asian, etc. No INSEAD, NUS, LBS, nah - They don’t align with my goals.I could have tried CAT for the IIMs PGDM, but I am too old for that, with 5 years of work ex, I wouldn’t get much of public policy related jobs.I could have tried for IIMs Executive MBA, the PGPX and EPGP, again they don’t specialize in Public Policy analysis that well.ISB made the perfect sense to me.ISB has a specialization/major in Public Policy - Govt of Andhra, Telangana, Dalberg, Cargill - All working in PP sector come for placements. I could try for management consulting for govt sector or development consulting roles - Which are around 200 jobs in total.Work for 10 years in the Corporate sector with Public Policy.Higher pay, urban life, faster promotions, happy family life - And most importantly, I can focus on public policy ideation.And a decade later, apply for the lateral entry to the Government as Joint Secretary posts.And then see what will happen.I know it is a long shot. But a plan had to be formed.And that is why the MBA. At this juncture.I am 27 years old. Time is running out.A One-Year flagship ISB MBA made sense to me, which will plunge me to the upper public policy analysis sector of the corporate world.And that is why theIt is not the money or the getting suited up or anything.I had the goal of Govt Policy ideation and drafting 05 years ago. UPSC was the best way to do it. It didn’t happen.So, now will try the second best way to reach the goals.The ends are the same. Only the means have changed.ISB - IITM - MHA - GoI - Quora - Rural Bihar.All are dots that are now being connected.As I said, my story hasn’t ended yet.It has only begun.","2,730 followers",Victoria Zorzoli,1.2K,77,3.2M,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-the-Indian-education-system-encourage-passion-for-learning-subjects-rather-than-focusing-on-rote-learning-Does-the-Indian-education-system-promote-rote-learning-at-the-expense-of-critical-thinking-ingenuity-and-life-long-learning
