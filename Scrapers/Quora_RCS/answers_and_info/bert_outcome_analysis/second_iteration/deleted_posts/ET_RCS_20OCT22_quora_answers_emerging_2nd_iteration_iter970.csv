1,"Incident 1:In 1988, India require supercomputers for research work, to manufacture satellites, for weather-forecasting, to manufacture military weapons. In universities, for scientists to continue their research, we required supercomputers.At that time an American companySo, India wanted to buy supercomputers from that US company for 70 crores. For a company to sell any high-technology goods to another company, it needs to take the permission of government of that country. So, CRAY company asked the permission of American government to sell supercomputersIncident 1:In 1988, India require supercomputers for research work, to manufacture satellites, for weather-forecasting, to manufacture military weapons. In universities, for scientists to continue their research, we required supercomputers.At that time an American companySo, India wanted to buy supercomputers from that US company for 70 crores. For a company to sell any high-technology goods to another company, it needs to take the permission of government of that country. So, CRAY company asked the permission of American government to sell supercomputers for India. But US government didn’t give the permission. US claimed that ‘If we give this technology for India, it will use it for military purposes, instead of educational purposes’. So, America disagreed to sell the supercomputer technology to India. But, for research purposes India require supercomputer urgently.At that time, Rajiv Gandhi was the prime minister of our country. He arranged a meeting with the scientists. In that meeting, a famous scientist namedRajiv Gandhi asked whether we can manufacture a supercomputer.Then Vijay Bhatkar answered “ I did not use a supercomputer till now. I saw CRAY supercomputer also just in a photo. But we have the capacity to manufacture a supercomputer”.Then Rajiv Gandhi asked “How long does it takes?”Vijay Bhatkar replied “ It would take less time than that of what it takes if we import it from America.”Then Rajiv Gandhi asked “ How much it costs to manufacture a supercomputer?”Vijay Bhatkar answered “ The cost of building the institute, developing the technology and manufacturing the supercomputer would take less cost than that of importing it from CRAY company.”Then Rajiv Gandhi was impressed and gave green signal for theFor this project, in 1988 an institute ‘ Centre for Development of Advanced Computing’ (C-DAC) was build. Many scientists started working on this project. Just in 3 years, Indian scientists got the fruit for their hard work. In 1991, India succeeded in manufacturing a supercomputer. It was named asBut America doubted the Indian supercomputer PARAM. It claimed that ‘it is not a supercomputer and it doesn’t have the capability’. Then India took the PARAM supercomputer to International Exhibition. PARAM was tested there. Then they came to know thatNext day in a newspaper headline, about PARAM was“Supercomputer which is manufactured by India has some special features.CRAY supercomputer costs 70 crores, but PARAM costs just 3 crores.That’s why, 14 universities belonging to Britain, Canada and Germany bought our supercomputer. By can’t withstanding the competition from India, CRAY company was forced to reduce the prices of its supercomputer. The power of PARAM was 28 times more than the supercomputer of CRAY.Like this Rajiv Gandhi and Vijay Bhatkar made India into the list of countries having a supercomputer.Incident 2:In 1929, once Bhagat Singh threw some bombs into assembly to scare Britishers. So, Bhagat Singh was arrested and was introduced in the court. And some others who were involved in this case where standing along with Bhagat Singh in the court. Among them Jatindra Nath Das was also present. To testify Fanindra Nath was standing opposite to them.The bombs which were thrown in the assembly were prepared by Fanindra Nath. But he changed as an approver and came to the court to testify. At that time many people don’t know how to prepare bombs and there was no source to collect the information. Fanindra Nath was one of the few persons who know how to prepare bombs.Lawyer came and asked Fanindra Nath whether he prepared bombs.Fanindra Nath said that he only prepared the bombs and gave it to Bhagat Singh.Bhagat Singh replied that Fanindra Nath did not prepare the bombs. He also said that Fanindra did no know how to prepare the bombs.Fanindra Nath said that Jatindra Nath Das, who was beside Bhagat Singh, taught him how to prepare the bombs.Then Jatindra Nath said that he was lying and he don’t know anything about bombs.Fanindra Nath answered that shall I say how to prepare a bomb.Jatindra Nath said that then say to the court how to prepare a bomb.Then Fanindra Nath explained the process of preparing bombs clearly in the court. All the journalists in the court wrote it.After completion of the explanation Fanindra Nath asked can you believe me now that I know how to prepare bombs.Then Bhagat Singh, Jatindra and their followers started laughing and said “ Thanks Fanindra, till now only you know how to prepare bombs. Now, journalists have written the process of preparing bomb, so tomorrow morning through newspapers everyone would know how to prepare a bomb.”All the British officers present over there were shocked. They used the court for their freedom fight. Fanindra Nath was fooled.This Jatindra Nath Das was none other than who died after a hunger-strike for 63 days for the reason that prisoners are not treated well in the prison.Incident 3:In 2014, Mangalyaan Space Vehicle, which belongs to India entered into Mars Planet Orbit. Then New York Times published the following photo:It means, in the Mars orbit already USA and Russia were present from a long time. After so much time, poor country India entered it.In 2017, ISRO created a record by launching 104 satellites. Then Times of India published the following photo:It means, American companies are coming to poor country India, for asking to launch their satellites.Lets see some facts about Mangalyaan:To launch this type of space vehicle into the Mars orbit, NASA took 5 years whereas ISRO took just 15 months to complete this mission.Until now only America, Russia and Europe have succeeded in this mission. That to in 51 times of trials, it succeeded just for 21 times. But India succeeded in its first attempt only.The total cost of this project is 74 million dollars. It means every Indian has contributed ₹ 5 for this project.For complete journey of 780 million km, it costs 6 rupees for every km. It is less than the cost charged by auto drivers per km in india.Incident 4:In 17th century, Dutch East India company was the biggest. It was nearly 10 times bigger than the present Apple company.But an Indian king collapsed such a company. In 17th century, Dutch East India company, had trading with South India for spices. It bought those spices for low prices in India and sold them for higher prices in other countries. So this company became very rich. By that richness, it occupied some kingdoms in South India. In behalf of that they also tried to occupy Travancore kingdom also. At that time, Travancore was ruled byHe did not accept to surrender his kingdom to that company. Then, that company started a war against him. Soldiers of both the kingdoms had a war. But, the Dutch company was defeated badly in this war. Then both had an agreement.By that agreement, all the properties and assets of the company in South India came to Marthanda Varma. The king became rich. He became so rich that, he frequently donated his property to the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in his kingdom. It is one of the reasons for Padnabhaswamy Temple to become rich.Incident 5:If any Indian in foreign asks for help in twitter, then Sushma Swaraj would respond very quickly. One day a person tagged Sushma Swaraj and tweeted:Once in a meeting in UNO, a Pakistan representative named India as Mother of Terrorism. Then Sushma Swaraj replied “ Yes, its true. That’s why we gave birth to a terror nation in 1947”.We have so many untold stories like this in our country…Thanks for reading…Jai Hind…Image Source: GoogleThe Little Known Story of How India's First Indigenous Supercomputer Amazed the World in 1991Battle of Colachel - WikipediaEdit 1:Edit 2:",167 followers,Saketh Ram Pullakandam,4.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time. We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. U.S. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they become available. Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise. Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others. There is no guarantee that foreign governments will assist U.S. citizens in leaving Yemen. U.S. citizens who choose to seek foreign government assistance in leaving Yemen should only do so if they can safely make their way to the point of embarkation and have received confirmation that there is space available. Even if assured there is space aboard transportation, U.S. citizens should be aware that there is no guarantee that they will be permitted to board the transport, or may have to wait an indefinite period until they can do so. There is also no guarantee of where travelers will go.India on the other hand had a challenging task. There were over 3000 Indian citizens more than the number of US citizens in Yemen.

I think he could have got a Gold had he not injured his hand during the Clean and Jerk round, but nevertheless, he was the second best and dedicated his silver to the armed forces of the nation who spend sleepless nights to safeguard the nation! Seeing an Indian finish on the podium and saying these inspiring words is truly a moment of pride for any Indian.Next was the Men's 61 kilogram category where Gururaj Pujari went on to win a Bronze medal. The fight at the top was a tough one and after the Snatch round, he was placed in 4th position but he went on to lift two more kilograms from the 3rd placed Canadian and went past him to snatch the Bronze medal. It was a close call but nevertheless, it secured another medal for India. Interestingly, both of us share the same birthday!Then was perhaps the most awaited event for the day where Mirabai Chanu featured in the Women's 49 kilogram category. She looked so confident that she registered her first attempt much ahead of what the rest finished at. She went on to set a new Commonwealth Games record and was much ahead of her competitors. Undoubtedly, she deserved the Gold and on any given day, she would have won it! She was just a class apart yesterday.The final event last night was the Women's 55 kilogram category that continued till 2 o'clock in the night. Bindyarani Devi secured a silver medal by lifting a total of 202 kilograms, missing out on winning the Gold by one kilogram only.We did miss two gold medals since both the silver medallists were behind by one kilogram, but that's okay. A silver medal is still a huge achievement in itself and, as a citizen, I cannot feel more proud than seeing four medals in a single day! A lot of events are still left and we have some great contenders too. So one thing for sure, plenty of more medals to follow!",194 followers,Shivam Chaudhary,3K,1.6K,2M,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

He crossed from west to east, the Indian, Pacific, Southern and Atlantic oceans, covering 23,000 nautical miles. The journey took 151 days.During the journey, Tommy faced shortage of drinking water due to the failure of the onborad water treatment plant and diesel leak which contaminated his stored water supply. He was left with approximately 15 litres of water which would last for 15 days, hence he resorted to rain water harvesting.He had not sighted human beings for the last 130 days, the last sighting of his being Srilankan fishermen. Tommy reported that the immigration officers who stamped his passport were confused as they noticed that his passport did not contain the country of arrival once he left India!!He was awarded The Keerthi Chakra and the Tenzing Norgay adventure award for his brave act.A big salute to such brave young men and The Indian navy for imparting such strength and zeal into our young men. They have really been one of the biggest source of pride for India since the country was born.Resources1.P.S. He is also active on quoraEdit : Recently while competing in the golden globe race, one of the most challenging endurance race on the planet commander Tommy had sailed into a hurricane force conditions in a most uncharted and remote place in the Indian ocean last month.Commander Tommy's boat had been hammered by 14 mtrs high waves with wind speed touching 150kmph. He lost the main mast of the boat and was slammed on to the deck. He has suffered a severe back injury and was stranded 1900 nautical miles south of perth. His survival was ensured by only his naval training and sailing skills. He has been rescued by an international effort and has been bought back after his boat had been seriously damaged.The true example of a survivor.","16,375 followers",NAMIT BATHLA,1.2K,280,7.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

This kind gesture was needed and it was observed all over the city where residents helped strangers in facing the Fury of this devastating rainfall.On TwitterPeople are helping in whichever way they can. One of the gesture I saw in news was trains were completely shut on central line. Roadway was then too affordable hence a truck driver was helping people reach from Kurla to Thane in his truck. I don't have reference to that but such deeds are being performed.Such noble acts of selflessness makes us proud. These generous acts ensuring sufferers face minimal problems bring a huge smile and hope on our face.Some might believe this is the what one ideally should do that is help others in tough times. But today where only news we hear is how people have become selfish, unkind, self-centered; these deeds surely shows ray of hope for better society and brings a refreshing smile that such kind souls too exist.Hatsoff to the spirit of Mumbaikars and all those people who are actively participating in all these.Will like to end with great lines describing my great cityAi dil hai mushakil jeena yahaHappy reading :)SourcesMumbai's 300 mm Rain Makes Tuesday Wettest August Day In 20 YearsRains wreak havoc in Mumbai; Met office predicts more 'heavy showers' - Times of IndiaMumbai Gets 9 Times Usual Rain, Every Minute A StruggleAsIn Rain-Hit Mumbai, Offers Of Food And Shelter Via Twitterhttps://www.google.co.in/amp/m.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/help-pours-in-locals-open-doors-for-people-stranded-in-mumbai-rains/story-tYfYtGRg5raijSrGy9AfAM_amp.html",220 followers,Syed Hashir Adnan,1.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

Windows could not run on such a machine without being recompiled from scratch.You don’t have the source code for Windows, so you could not do that. Microsoft very likely does not have a suitable cross-compiler, so you would have to pay them a very great deal of money to develop and test a toolchain capable of making a Windows edition that would even boot.And then, when you’ve got your supercomputer booted with Windows, what apps are you going to run?

Don’t forget to get a browser created, or you won’t even be able to Google.Are you done yet? No. This is a supercomputer - are you going to run single-user apps on a machine capable of 93 petaFLOPS.? Isn’t that a bit disrespectful, not to mention wasteful? So you need to find some supercomputer apps that exploit the supercomputer hardware - and then cross-compile them too, or they won’t run in the Windows environment.We’ve skipped over the whole “testing the software to see if it still works correctly after being cross-compiled then fixing the inevitable bugs” phase, which is bigger than all the other stuff so far mentioned.TL;DR File this idea under “Curious Perversions in Modern Technology”",430 followers,Sandeep Gorai,865,86,390.8K,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud
40,"I am sure we can. But Windows is designed to be used as a desktop operating system, now being adapted to function as a tablet and phone operating system. That is where Microsoft spends the bulk of its development efforts, though it does offer a Server version as well. Why would you choose to use an OS designed for a different purpose on a supercomputer? You can deliver coal in a family car, but it is not designed for it. There are other OSes, notably the Unix family, which were designed for compute engines and then had a windowing interface glued (not always entirely perfectly) on top. Such OSI am sure we can.

Assuming the source code would have been available and assuming MS would have handed out free licenses, the unsolvable problem was that there wasn’t anything compelling enough about Windows that would warrant moving away from Linux.TechnicaCertainly.

You get to appreciate exponents and logs.Rules of thumb exist such as written by Amdahl (just died) in a debate, panel session talk in 1967. He extended to me machine-readable copyright on his text (it's barely 2.5 pages long). I incorporated his text into the Usenet comp.sys.super FAQ. A real gentleman Amdahl was. Fast machines also require fast memory and large secondary storage.General-purpose computing can usually trade computation time for computational storage. Supercomputing generally can't. Exceptions like the Pi-machine (noted below) exist. Historically, the ""super"" prefix came not directly from Superman, but the code word for the H-bomb Teller conceived from Hans Bethe's ideas about fusion. The super (-bomb) was completed before the first supercomputers.From the vendor view, they are, in many cases, willing to double the memory and maybe halve the clock speed. This barely makes a dent 2-D, 3-D, and even 4-D simulation and analysis packages. You have to have a hand on complexity or you will be seen as a clueless business user. You need factors of performance improvement of between 8-16 times (about 10 times faster and bigger) than existing architectures. You insist on proof, not simulation.It's all about the application and not necessarily about interaction. It all depends who and what justifies the expense.

46,See you can't define “technical specifications” of a super computer. A super computer is a computer which is much more powerful than even the top end consumer systems at the time it was built. Supercomputers are not just a single box like desktop PCs. They require a huge space to build since they are built with a huge amount of resources. I wouldn't be surprised to see entire rooms full of RAM and storage.They don't have a single CPU and GPU like most consumer systems. They combine hundreds of CPUs and GPUs to get the amount of power they require. If you consider the 1990s era even your phoneSee you can't define “technical specifications” of a super computer.
