Anyways, first comes bronze age then comes Iron Age and the Iron Age started in Tamilakam around 1000 BCE. So Tamils were not in any kind of disadvantage for missing Bronze Age.Was Ancient Tamilakam Rich?ChanakyaApart from hides and skins, [woolen] blankets and horses, the rest are available in the south: conch shells, diamonds, precious stones, pearls, and golds, are plentiful in the south.According to The Anabasis of Alexander: Book VIIIMegasthenes says that this oyster is taken with nets; that it is a native of the sea, many oysters being together, like bees; and that the pearl oysters have a king or queen, as bees do. Should anyone by chance capture the king, he can easily surround the rest of the oysters; but should the king slip through, then the others cannot be taken; and of those that are taken, the Indians let their flesh rot, but use the skeleton as an ornament.The Pandyan port city of Korkai was the center of pearl trade. Megasthenes also said that the Pandyans derived great wealth from the pearl trade.How good was the Ancient Tamilakam Military?Throughout the Sangam literature, Ancient Tamilakam was mentioned as a warring nation. The Moovendhar (Chera, Chola, and Pandya) were constantly warring amongst themselves for dominance. This lead to the development of many advanced military technologies of that time; the most famous one isTheThere were four gates to the fort surmounted by high towers, with massive walls built of rough-hewn stone. Surrounding the fort on its outside was a deep moat and around the moat was a thick jungle of thorny trees. The roads leading to the gates of the fort were wide enough to permit several elephants to pass abreast. There were all kinds ofFrom this we know there was already a warlike society existed in Tamilakam with proper defense and advanced weapons.Comparison between Ancient Tamil and Mauryan Army.Tamil kings and generals led the army and were carried by elephants and chariots armed with lances or swords and shields adorned with gold. The infantry was armed with largeMauryans administered by six chairs, one for each of the four arms of the army (infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots), one chair for the navy, and one for logistics and supply. The Infantry was armed with a longbow made of bamboo, a spear or javelin, aMauryans Broadsword and Animal Hide Shields are extremely inferior to Tamils Sword and Shields made of Wootz Steel.From all this available information, we can come to the conclusionDid the Tamil Kings pay tribute to Ashoka?No! There is only two source of information available on this topic one is from Sangam literature and the other is from Edicts of Ashoka but neither of them mentions anything about the Tamil kings paying tributes.Ashokavadana (2nd century CE) and Mahavamsa (5th century CE) are the first written records of Asoka's life. Both were writtenSome people also made claims that some Buddhist text says that southern kingdoms were paying tribute to Mauryans. That Buddhist text is from the 16th century writtenHere is the exact translation of Edict of AshokaEverywhere in the dominions of king Devanampriya Priyadarsin and (of those) who (are his) borderers, such as the Chodas, the Pandyas, the Satiyaputa, the Kelalaputa, Tamraparni, the Yona (Greek) king named Antiyoga (Antiochus), and the other kings who are the neighbours of this Antiyoga, everywhere two (kinds of) medical men were established by King Devanampriya Priyadarsin, (viz.) medical treatment for men and medical treatment for cattle.Wherever there were no herbs beneficial to men and beneficial to cattle, everywhere they were caused to be imported and to be planted. Likewise, wherever there were no roots and fruits, everywhere they were caused to be imported and to be planted.On the roads, trees were planted, and wells were caused to be dug for the use of cattle and men.— 2nd Major Rock Edict. Translation by E. Hultzsch a German Indologist and epigraphist who is known for his work in deciphering the inscriptions of Ashoka.DevanampriyaPriyadarsinSo did the Mauryans ever fought the Tamil kings?Yes, they did. Mauryans under the emperor Bindusara fought the Tamil kings and lost the battle. This must be the reason behind why Bindusara's life was not documented or erased from history. Most of his history comes from a 12th-century text called Parishishtaparvan written more than 1,500 years after his death.But Tamil Sangam literature recorded Mauryans incursions into Tamilakam in Akananuru 69, 251, 281 and Purananuru 175 and they were defeated by the Pandya kingAshoka became a Buddhist that's why he didn't conquer Tamilakam.Even if he wasn't a Buddhist he wouldn't have fought the Tamil Kings. First, Ashoka is not good at conquering like his grandfather in his entire life he fought 2 wars. He didn't even expand his father and grandfather's empire not even 10%.At its peak, Chandragupta Maurya is said to have 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalries, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants. But by the time of Ashoka, it must have been reduced to half because of Bindusara's war with Tamil kings. And Bindusara's death in 272 BCE led to a war over succession which lasted four years this might have reduced his army size even more. This might be the reason why Kalingas never feared Ashoka and thought they could win the war with Ashoka.Even with his big army, he was having a hard time capturing Kalinga. According to Ashoka edicts, about 100,000 people died on the Kalinga side and an equal number on Ashoka's side. But according to Kalinga's, they caused twice the amount of destruction they suffered. This war made Ashoka's army extremely weak and lead to the decline of the Mauryan Empire.Also, just because he had access to a big fighting force doesn't mean he can send all of them to war. He would have kept his army distributed throughout the country especially in the borders of Indo-Greek, Tamils, and Kalingas fearing an uprising.Ashokavadana also mentions incidents of Ashoka turning towards violence after adopting Buddhism.A non-Buddhist in Pundravardhana drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of Nirgrantha Jnatiputra (identified with Mahavira, the founder of Jainism). On the complaint of a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana. AroundWas Buddhism brought to Sri Lanka by Mauryans?According to Mahavamsa (5th century CE) written by a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka states that Buddhism was brought to Sri Lanka by Mahinda(born as Mahendra Maurya), the son of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka. But Ashokavadana makes no mention of Mahinda.When was Buddhism brought to Tamilakam?I believe Buddhism was introduced to Tamilakam during the reign of Pallavas around the 4th century. Because none of the Sangam works mention Buddhism. The earliest work which mentions Buddhism is Manimekalai which is dated around the 5th century. Oldest Evidence of Buddhism in Tamilakam is the Ancient ruins of a 4th-5th century Buddhist monastery at Pallavanesvaram.Also, there was some kind of hatred between early Tamil kings and Buddhist monks. This can be seen from the way they portrayed Tamil kings. For example, The Bodhisattva Pattini was incarnated as Kannagi in order to rid the Pandya kingdom of its evil three-eyed king. Here the Evil three-eyed king is Nedunjeliyan I.Another reason I can think of is the rivalry between Buddhism and Jainism. After Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism Jain monks must have made Tamilakam their stronghold. Sangam literature also mentions the presence of Jain monks in Tamilakam. For example, poet Kapilar before committing suicide left the daughters of Pari in the care of Jain monks.Most of the works which claim Buddhism was present in Tamilakam were written by Buddhist monks who lived outside Tamilakam in a later time period.",5 followers,John Smith,863,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-scientific-literary-works-ancient-or-modern-in-Tamil

Tamil city of Kanchi was a key national center for Sanskrit too. Most major Tamil kings kept Sanskrit names. Adaptations of Sanskrit epics such as Ramayana were highly popular. Tamil kings like the Pallavas were multilingual [proficient in Sanskrit & Prakrit as well as Tamil]. Cholas and other emperors issued their coins in both the languages. It would have been preposterous to them to see Tamil as some antithetical language of Sanskrit. Let me show you some ancient Tamil coins to show the status Sanskrit had.Later we were ruled by Vijayanagar, Marathas etc. Again, both languages played well.  This continued to the 20th century.The Stage 1 Dravidian movementAt the start of the 20th century, when the casteism was its peak, there were anti-Brahminism movements in a number of places. Tamil Nadu had its strongest. It is said that the founder of the Dravidian Kazhagam, EVR Periyar was abused during his trip to Varanasi as most mutts refused to take him, owing to him being a non-Brahmin.That movement got some steam and given that the varna system was not well established in TN, it was pretty much binary - Brahmin vs. Non-Brahmin. Thus, they probably strategized to go after Sanskrit - the language that Brahmins used as much as other languages, and that was an easier way to win Brahminism & hence the caste system [it's another matter that most people who participated in the movement never had any intention of giving up their castes and continue to retain it to this day].TheThe anti-Hindi movementThey longed for an opening into politics and 1965 provided them that. In that year, English was to cease its usage as an official language. The Constitution made Hindi as Indian Union's official language, giving a temporary status to English. That was to end on Jan 26, 1965.The prospect of losing precious government jobs [when central government exams were to be in just Hindi] galvanized the students - who were hitherto not too much involved in the Dravidian movement. The prospect of government jobs probably hit hard more than any notions before and anti-Hindi was the rage [there were previous anti-Hindi riots too in the decades before, but with a lot less success as it didn't have the job factor].On the back of fighting Hindi, the Dravidian movement quickly rode to power. They were also helped by the attitude of the Congress party under Kamaraj that overestimated their own influence [a popular phrase in Tamil refers to Kamaraj's statement that he could win even when lying down].Now, that they were in power, they got a chance to implement their long-desired policies. Every revolution needs a villain & a base to hold on. In case of this, they used Tamil language as their base with the villains being [Hindi/Sanskrit/Brahminism].In summary, the anti-Sanskrit attitude of some Tamils is primarily a result of the Dravidian movement and had little historic precedence. Again, their main grouse is not Sanskrit - it just that it became a collateral damage in the fight against Hindi and Brahminism.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,1.5K,5.6K,426.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-scientific-literary-works-ancient-or-modern-in-Tamil
2,"Is Tamil literature as ancient as it claims to be?Depends on what we define as ancient. If we call something that is reliably dated by eminent academics to around 200–300 BCE as ancient enough, then Tamil literature is indisputably ancient.Societies do not develop literary tradition all of a sudden. Such formal tradition must be preceded by strong oral tradition. So if Tolkappiyam arrived on the scene by 200–300 BCE, it must have had at least another 3–4 centuries of oral tradition to fall back on, i.e. the bardic tradition.

Pretty spectacular. Dirt poor with enormous political challenges and wars; increased wages 20 to 30 times; created 400 million middle class; liberated women; eradicated serfdom and slavery; provided land to all peasants; doubled life expectancy from 36 in 1949 to 76 years; provided free universal education; her child mortality surpassed some OECD countries; and is now a stable and prospering nation with a dream to be a modern strong and advanced first world nation by 2049.So why do people follow the negative narratives? For the 2 bad historic events? For having a different kind of society that puts country above society and above the individual that refuses to follow western norms? Did it ever make hard decisions believing them good but didn’t turn out well? Does that mean it is anything near “evil”? Has any evil government improved lives so much in such a short time?Shall we see what the China government has done for its people?Start with Education, building thousands of schools, China has provided free education of 9 years (and 12 years for some minority), raising the literacy from below 5% to 95%; with an impressive PISA score; and even allowed more than 5 million to study overseas.Next Transportation. Once they struggled to get a bicycle, now even a teen rides an electric scooter. Once a local train ride was a dream, yet now there are 140 million air-trips overseas a year and rising, with 5.5 billion domestic tourist trips.And 30,000 km of high speed rail (200 to 350 kph) which is 60% of the planet.Evidence- Once where there are narrow or dirt roads, they are endless expressways and huge bridges, airports and ports. And 25 million cars are produced a year, and huge number of electric scooters.Give people Housing. Developed 622 cities to urbanised 60% of the population in good modern housing; provided better wages and higher living standards to almost a billion. And a few hundred airports to providing air travel between cities and the world.Deal with Pollution and Green. To fight desertification and pollution, it turn entire deserts into forests, planting millions of trees.

Anyone who accesses the outranet without the acknowledgment of the government is guilty. That is to say, what I am doing is illegal in more than one sense.For that reason, we all recieve selected information about everything, as all info spreaders like news press and social media are censored by the government. All information we receive is for the interest of the government. And information that's against the government are always missing or even prohibited.As a consequence, we see things they want us to see , believe what they want us to believe.

I'm part of the lgbt community. But it was only when I started to access outranet (illegally) that I realized my identity. Before that I was constantly denying my own existence because little about lgbt was to be found online. As a result most middle-aged people are either ignorant or homophobic. Even my highschool teacher announced that LGBT is an evil concept from the west that is causing the spread of HIV in China.Can you imagine loving someone yet you can't hold hands or kiss in public? That's exactly what's like to be LGBT in China, Simply because the government thinks LGBT is detergent for the population growth.Speaking of the population, I must say a word about the population-aging issue and the drastic decline of Natural population growth, thanks to the GOOD work of the government. In the last decades, many women suffered from the one-child policy, simply because the government doesn't want too many population. When the issues resulting from the policy merged, the government released another policy called “two-children policy”. Yet the population refused to grow as they wish. And then they released new policies to allow more children to be born.But the people are not idiots. They won't give birth to more children just because they are allowed to.

Most youngsters are now unable to afford a shelter, not to mention getting married or having children.

There are many types of freedom, but the west tends to equate freedom with political freedom, and in my view this is a very narrow definition. This is because different cultures have different priorities about the various types of freedom.

Entire networks come crashing down. But then you are now in a position to conspire covering the tracks of those who built the castle. The sins of Mao and Deng are covered.The Chinese government is no more 'evil' than other governments, but the CCP has done many evil things - on a far larger scale than almost any other government. It continues doing evil things because non-accountability and opacity are institutionalized. And there is very little anyone can do to stop it.

Most Chinese I know, and have discussed the matter with, are extremely happy with President Xi Jinping, and they mostly support his opposition of the US’ ridiculous trade war. Most are extremely happy with his handling of the economy and reduction of official corruption in the last half-decade.In the last year nationalism has been on the rise, and they completely support the idea of a New Long March to resist the Americans. Chinese are voting with their Renminbi: they are choosing not to buy American brands, even the USD 350 billion+ that is Made in China under US brands for the Chinese domestic market.Foreigners who have not lived in China, or have not been here for an extended period of time, often cannot understand why anyone would be happy living in a so-called non-democratic society. My answer would be this: do you want a vote every four years, or do you want a competent government that gives the people everything they need to be successful? Voting, or not voting, guarantees nothing. Democracy sometimes delivers result, often not. Autocracy sometimes delivers results, often not.China has a unique system of government that works for them - really works for them. I don’t think any Zhongguo Tong (foreign China expert) would recommend trying the Chinese model in any other country. Likewise, why on earth would China want to adopt the US model.So in summary, does the average Chinese person hate the government. No they don’t, far from it, but they do have a very healthy cynicism about all authority no matter where it lies. In fact, I doubt that most Chinese people even think about this question. If they get 3 points on their license, and a 2,000 yuan fine, for jumping a red light, they sure as hell hate that the government for putting a camera above the intersection to catch them. That’s the level at which most Chinese would hate the government if they hate them at all.

And I am studying a MA program in Russia.I guess I am one of those well educated Chinese.I love our country, I support our government. But it doesn’t mean than I agreed with everything that CCP had done. For example, the time of cultural revolution was the hell for Chinese people. GFW is bad for getting new information. Sometimes we also think CCP does too much they shouldn’t do.But one thing you have to remember is that after 1840, we had never been so close to the historical position than today. (Someone may argue about if we chose a democratic system the future of PRC would be better. But if you really do some research about Taiwan or India, you will find sometimes democracy is prison for developing economy.）Ask yourself why do you want an election? Why do you want to change?Usually, we need an election to vote for those political parties that swear to make our lives better. Or those politicans who can protect our interests. Sometimes politicians are good liars, they told everyone about their perfect plans. But in the end of their terms they did nothing… You were very very angry, and then decide to vote for another party, another politician. It’s that democracy? For many developing countries, their politicans just simply keep talking…Let’s see what CCP have said and what they have done. As usual, when they made a 5 years plan, they would not only achieve their goals, but also overfulfil them. If you want more people to share your cake, first of all, you should make this cake bigger. For most ordinary people, they don’t really care about who will be their leaders, they care about their own interests. Me, as an ordinary Chinese citizen, I got more Benefits from CCP than I lost. To be honest, I gave up some of my freedom in order to benefit securities from orderly government. (There are many educated chinese people like me) .How could we judge a government is good or bad? Of course, the judgment method won’t be if this government has elective government and democratic system or not. Otherwise, such countries like Philippine and Liberia would be the best countries, because they all have complete democratic system.One of the best judgement methods is whether this government really improved the living standards and living qualities (HDI, life expectancy,GDPForm WBFrom WB[3]As a proletarian party, CCP will never make everyone happy. And CCP will seriously punish those who dare to challenge this political system. So no matter how much CCP did for the most Chinese people. There are still some people dislike or even hate CCP. Well, I think it’s ok, even elected politicians or partiesHere's an analogy to help you know this system:You are a pretty smart and hard-working Asian scientist today. But when you were a young boy, you wanted to get freedom, you wanted to play computer game all the days, you wanted to be an artist. You wanted to date a neighbour little girl.Should you say thank you to your dad or not?CCP did force our chinese people to do something that we didn’t really want to do, but those things were mainly good for Chinese people (again, not everything). Because of some decisions that CCP had made. We did lost some opportunities. (for example, if we chose democratic System we might be the best partner for the U.S. in Asia after 1949, we might develop very fast like Japan) . If we were not lucky enough. We might be a bigger India or a bigger Iraq. who knows? All of these things might be true But no one can be a Prophet of future. We just simply chose another way that we thought it’s good. And it helped make PRC what it is today.As for one man one vote. One reporter asked our former premier Zhu Rongji when we could see direct election and competitive election in PRC? He answered: we would like to get it as soon as possible.There were many “if” in the history. But there are no “if” in the history.I personally don’t want to guess what the history would be. But if we are talking about today. I don’t think another party can do better than CCP.There is Old saying in China:In 1992, GDP per capita in PRC was 493$, 25 years passed, the number is about 8500$ in this year, our gdp per capita was growing more than 1700%As a master student who is studying political science, I have to admit that democracy is a great system. But it’s simply one of many ways to develop a country.Most of young chinese people aren’t crazy fans of CCP, and we don’t specially support CCP, we just simply support the ones who make our country and our lives better.The writer of a famous book <(I will continue to write about this topic)",37 followers,Yifei Yao,5K,777,1.5M,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Chinese-government-evil

When disasters such as epidemics, floods and fires occur, the Chinese government will make prompt response and arrangements, put people first and life first, and spare no effort to protect the life, health, value and dignity of every human being. And most of the time, governments are thinking about how they can improve the well-being of their people. The Chinese trust the government not because it is perfect, not because it never makes mistakes, but because it is very diligent, always does its job well, and is more reliable and efficient than any other government, so why should the Chinese people complain?When you look at what the US government has done for its people, the answer is clear. While the United States has the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the world, the U.S. government has failed to develop effective measures to control COVID-19. Both parties only want to defend their own positions, regardless of the actual feelings of the people. Political polarization has torn apart American politics and, in turn, severely weakened the cohesion of the people. The legacy of racism in the United States could not be eradicated, and the police's violent enforcement of the law resulted in Freud's death. In the midst of a cold snap, the state has been unable to provide water and electricity, and has even told struggling residents that ordinary people without water and electricity should find their own way to survive, rather than turning to the government for help. Disasters that happened to the American people , for the Chinese are sympathetic and unimaginable. If the Chinese government had done this, the Chinese people would have risen up against it. What the government is doing is unlikely to please everyone, but it should at least please most people. It is clear that the US regime is incompetent by comparison.So in this context, whenever I see US politicians trying to drive a wedge between the Chinese people and their government, I can't help but chuckle: they are over-confident!","84,301 followers",Paul Denlinger,1.5K,11.5K,55M,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Chinese-government-evil

Our first TFLOPS-capable system wasNow, pretty much all supercomputers are built as Linux clusters — they might use prettier-looking rack mounts rather than wire shelving, but they’re still basically leveraging the excellent price/performance of commodity PC parts in building custom parallel supercomputers.Of course, the biggest supercomputers have scaled to millions of processors and they cost a lot more than $40K. However, you can still build a supercomputer with many times the performance of a single PC for between $20K-$40K — about the price of a new car. You personally almost certainly don’t need one, but $40K is cheap enough so that any scientist or engineer can easily afford to have one in their lab to be continuously dedicated to running whatever code they need to run.If you only need a supercomputer every so often, or occasionally need a really big machine, you can now rent time on remote cluster supercomputers in “the cloud” for quite low cost, and that also saves you the pain of setting-up and maintaining your own cluster. You’d be surprised at how much supercomputing resource you can get for $100 via one of these remotely-accessed systems….",3 followers,Steve Baker,556,27.3K,162.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Chinese-government-evil

When asked how the vague quesIn the radio series (then novel) “Dumbstruck, the successors to Deep Thought’s creators asked it why it gave that answer, and Deep Thought responded that it was just answering their very vague question as best it could. When asked how the vague question could be improved, Deep Thought said that even it wasn’t powerful enough to calculate “The Question to the Ultimate Answer”.Deep Thought then designed a new super-computer, with bio-organic matrices and sub-processors, which would be capable of calculating the Ultimate Question. This new super-computer would be the size of a planet, and would be named “Earth” (which everyone agreed was a boring name).Millions of years later, on the “planet” Earth, the calculation was about to be completed, and the Ultimate Question would finally be known. However, five minutes before this was due to happen, a Vogon Constructor Fleet - operating under the authority of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council - vaporised the Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.Outside the context of the books, however, Douglas Adams - the author - was a computing enthusiast. In the context of some early programming languages, “42” was the numeric representation of the asterisk (*) symbol. In programming, the asterisk was frequently used as a placeholder symbol, and so could mean anything depending on what the programmers choose to replace it with.As such, it’s thought that Adams was secretly saying that the “Ultimate Answer” is whatever you want it to be, and that there is no set meaning to existence.

But what they are is likely to be a combination of a variety of different technologies.ONE — with the advent of super-computers that move not just fast, but faster than light, they can learn a new language the way you did as an infant, but in the blink of an eye. Each ship throws a basic set of universal features at each other: numbers, prime numbers, integers, etc. Then they move on to shooting images/words of elements. This would be easy for a computer to figure out. Then you move on to shooting images/sounds of various features: a star, a planet, a ship. With enough repeated exposure (speed your learning capacity up by 100 billion — keep in mind, that if you’re lucky, you will live 3 billionTWO — the more speculative nature of shared linguistic technology. Say, you’re the USS Titan. Riker is your captain. So, besides my condolences in having Captain Xanax as your leader, you also get a nice new ship. Over the past 250 years of interstellar travel, the UFP has uploaded the linguistic library of literally millions of languages. We have several dozen thousands on Earth. Across the thousands of planets exists millions of languages.Riker’s USS Titan — a ship that I want to love, except for the drooping nacelles. That part, I fucking hate. Is there like, Starfleet Viagra for ship nacelles?Along the way, the Titan meets a friendly ship that has traveled 12,000 light years (1/8 the distance of the Milky Way). Those aliens want to find a safe place to meet the locals and they have hibernated for 50 years to get there. On their ship is a library of languages they’ve downloaded. Along the way, their ship has encountered 756,478 different species, few of whom they’ve had difficulty talking with. Why? Because six of the species they encountered were friendly and shared linguistic data with them. One of their more friendly trading species has sent out 187,500 different missions to nearby nations/governments. Those ships brought back linguistic data from those nations, which amounted to 57 million different languages.How did they get those? Those nations studied the languages of their member planets and also sent out missions to different worlds to study their languages. On one of those missions, the starship Gravornalax was on a 10 year voyage deep into the Gamma Quadrant. It collected linguistic data on over 6 million different species and 20 times that many languages. And on and on and on.Data in a small galaxy (the Milky Way is small in the grand scheme of things) wherein species had been trading and traveling for literally hundreds of millions of years, would enable the rapid dissemination of linguistic data to everybody else. The sharing need not be altruistic — some of it would be stored in probes and harvested, some of it would be incorporated into the ship-to-ship handshake protocol, some of it would be shared after they worked things out. Thing is, through convergent evolution and experimentation, the half of all species that were above-average gregarious would be sharing something of their encounters with other species (in exchange for the same in return).Over a period of only a century or so, data passed from ship to ship would eventually repeat some languages over and over, but would eventually provide multiple new language. In the end, through having literally dozens of millions of languages, having super computers, and lastly through having the ability to learn how to quickly teach a new language (at FTL supercomputer speeds), most ships would probably instantly have the languages of most nearby species.The rest?Best not to think about it. It’s one of many, MANY Trek features that if you ponder too long, will only give you a headache.","1,644 followers",David Lourne,846,521,4.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-scientific-literary-works-ancient-or-modern-in-Tamil
