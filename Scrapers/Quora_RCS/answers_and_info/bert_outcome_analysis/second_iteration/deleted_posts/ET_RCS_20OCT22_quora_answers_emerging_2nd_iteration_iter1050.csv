And trust me, to get good grades, here the education system is such that, you have to work hard. Because everyone in your class is as competitive as you are. That drives up the standards.You aren't a citizen in these foreign countries, so still you get a green card, you can;t afford to lose your job. If you are working in a company, you are constantly trying to hold on to that job, work hard, and in the process get recognized. Possibly promoted.Same thing with research. You relax, and someone else gets your stipend and scholarships. You can't afford that. You are forced to be at your best, always.These things make others see you as successful. Small things are lost too. You want to call your friends, meet up, talk to them as often as everyday, but you don;t have the time, coz you are struggling to get that assignment done, or to keep that job.I have always heard people tell, if you want to succeed, come out of your comfort zone. You will be forced to succeed or perish. Most of the times, we do succeed.India, homeland, is the comfortzone to most people. You have everything you want, you don;t have the need to push yourself, the motivation to succeed is lost(in most people, the rest, stand out). It's teh other way when you come to the US or other countries on loans. You are forced to succeed, and most of them are motivated enough to succeed.Most back in India believe it's a easy choice to go abroad work and make more money. They believe live is easy in the US. Trust me, it's not. It's a struggle. And once here, you learn to enjoy the struggle :)",0 followers,Colin Zhou,7.6K,370,29M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-Indians-become-successful-only-after-leaving-for-the-US-or-Europe-What-does-India-lack

Thousands of students suicide in India just because even getting  excellent scores and ranks and percentiles in competitive exams they don't even get anywhere close to what they deserve just because some other guy was born in a reserved cast. And the system is so engraved in our society that no can remove it. That sucks. Ask a general candidate who dosent get a call from IIMA at 99 percentile because for him/her the cut off was 99.7, and for reserved? 75!!! Can you even imagine what it takes to get 99 percentile? And trust me, the difference between a 99 and a 75 percentile is same as 75 percentile and zero! And i mean it. This is just an example. Its everywhere! Promotions are also based on reservation and what not!Don't anybody dare blame the Indians going abroad to study. What option do they really have!? To fight was less than 50 percent seats in such a heavily populated place where some of the planet's toughest competitive exams take place.Hence these students (only a fraction who can afford) go abroad and become successful which would be the answer to the question.P.S: I am against cased based reservation but strongly support income based reservation. Also, i think reservation for girls is important because of the patriarchal nature of our society where males think they are Gods or something.By:General Male Engineer!",UNKNOWN,Kalyan,1.2K,224,829K,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-Indians-become-successful-only-after-leaving-for-the-US-or-Europe-What-does-India-lack

I am not saying India is a perfect nation, but please guys! don't generalize individual experiences so much that they are mistaken for facts and every pessimistic query about your country is met with the same generalized negative feelings.I'll start with highlighting some basic economic facts which show why the basic premise for this question is misguided.1. There are an estimated total of 25 million people in this world who are either NRIs or PIOs. Even if the OP considers a foreign job & residency as a sole mark of success, the whole NRI+PIO population is not even 2% of the total number of people living in India today. Hardly classifiable as 'Most Indians'2. Out of this figure of 25 million, only 2.8 million people are in United States and a few more in the European Countries.There are a good many more who live in many other parts of the world and fulfill the technical and labor requirements in many other countries.It is immature to assume that most of the successful Indians are the NRIs and PIOs. India would not be where it is today had it not been for the people of India who have lived in the country and set up businesses, trades, schools, NGOs, hospitals, farms, etc to make India self-dependent economically.The only reason why you hear so much about the success of NRIs and POIs in the media is because government needs money to do it's job and they want to attract investment.And of course the currency value of India is lower than many western countries, thatIt just requires a little basic knowledge of global economics to understand, individual experiences will always be too varied to draw any conclusions from it.Good Luck and hope that answers your query.","45,216 followers",Bala Senthil Kumar,512,12.1K,51.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-Indians-become-successful-only-after-leaving-for-the-US-or-Europe-What-does-India-lack

Also the fear of failure leads to fewer entrepreneurs and above all the wrath of being castigated always plays on your mind. However, in countries like USA and Nations in Europe, this is exactly the opposite. Everyone is allowed to pursue what he wants with full freedom and no fear of failure. Infact, the societies in these countries embrace failure! They won't castigate you! Rather they would look into why you failed and what you learned from it! Because they strongly believe that if you failed, you will learn from the mistakes and fare better in your next endeavors! An average entrepreneur in USA fails 4 times before he makes his billions! The founder of Uber failed 2 times went broke and then found Uber! Imagine if he would have been in India! He would have been a social outcast! Also, due to poverty of India, every parent wants to first focus on money! Do what makes money! Whereas in USA or Europe, alot of emphasis is given to make sure you follow your passion! Eventually, you will make money! Also, people are given full freedom to pursue their aspirations!Also, age is never a barrier in USA or Europe to stop you from doing something! Steve Austin Wier a salesman suffering from economic hardships in The Great Depression of 1929 turned to become a lawyer in that period at the age of 45! While this is possible in India, we all know how Indians react to this! ""45 ki umar me lawyer banne chala""(At the age of 45, he wants to become a lawyer)!

10,"Short Answer:TL;DR version:Short Answer:TL;DR version:Coming to the original topic, let me explain the Knowledge Based Society. In simple terms, a society where knowledge forms the basis of livelihood, business, development, economics and politics is a Knowledge Based Society. Knowledge is given the utmost respect and priority in such societies. Consider few examples:The institutions in the west where these experiments were carried out without the fear from society or government. In fact, such researches were supported by funds from the state and philanthropists. No prejudice or stigma ever came in the way to such findings. Industries readily accepted and implemented those results. As people made lot of money from such endeavors, a portion was feedback in the system – leading to the development of world-class research institution and laboratories. Luckily, these things continue to happen there.Do we ever give such freedom to our students? Even if someone makes an important study, do we recognize her talent? Does industry ever adopt/endorse the researches made in our labs? Are our educational institutions linked to the needs and wants of our society? Does media ever invite professors/scientists/researchers to give a talk on gender-imbalance, declining agriculture, degrading environment, and GDP. Or for that matter, if TV channels begin telecasting such talks throughout the day, will viewers be able to tolerate them?

Usually, the software is complex and multi-layered because it needs to be.","21,424 followers",Vladislav Zorov,785,16.1K,63.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-Indians-become-successful-only-after-leaving-for-the-US-or-Europe-What-does-India-lack

Compare that to the 500,000,000 byte programs of today, or the gigabytes of software code that powers a large complex app like Facebook.How did BASIC do so much with so little? Well, first off, they had to; the program size was a hard cost constraint. To achieve this, they picked a language with a very limited feature set, and implemented the features in the most limited way possible that was still useful. There were only 25 commands, variable names were limited to two characters (a letter and a number) and there was no string support, only numbers. Programs had a small maximum size.The complexity of modern software allows it to do more, more flexibly, and faster in a way that is easier to use. In the simple world, everything was through a terminal program with a 24 line screen. There was no support for arbitrary fonts which scale to any resolution in any color and can be typeset as you type; there was no support for photographs, CD-quality music, or video.Layering is what allows complex software to avoid collapsing under its own weight. Layering is the relentless process of simplifying complex things as much as possible while preserving their capabilities. That allows new layers to be built on top.The simple elegant programs are still around; they are just buried inside more complex programs, for example almost every modern program includes quick-sort somewhere. The simple end-user programs are now in museums because they aren’t very useful in the age of the internet.","1,450 followers",Max Poshusta,2.4K,860,4.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-Indians-become-successful-only-after-leaving-for-the-US-or-Europe-What-does-India-lack
