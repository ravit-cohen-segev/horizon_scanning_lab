Additionally, a petaflop can be measured asIf we filled Burj Khalifa’s 200-plus-storey floor space (equivalent to roughly 334,000 m²) with Summit supercomputers, that would be… a lot! Going by Math alone without any other considerations, roughly 397 Summits will fit in that space, equipped with around 149 million cores and a whopping 59 thousand petaflops (or 59 exaflops [Honestly, I have no idea why anyone would need a supercomputer that big, since the trend with computing has always been to miniaturize.Anyway, the smallest planet in our solar system is Mercury, with a radius of 2,439.7 km. So, before we can build a computer as big as a planet, the first hurdle we have to surmount is how to build a super-collosal-big-fat-boss-skyscraper 2,500 km high. Considering that the tallest building in the world right now is not even a kilometer high, this is a tall order. Probably, the best option would be to construct in space.Next is where to get the materials. We might need to mine a terrestrial planet or several moons and asteroids, and for that, we will require advanced space transport technology to quickly ferry materials between planets (without waiting for months or years for each trip), advanced robotics and artificial intelligence technologies to perform autonomous space mining, advanced life support systems for people if required, and so on, and so forth. Humans have not even gone beyond the Moon yet, so we are still decades behind these required technologies.Then, we have to consider a perpetual energy source that could power the entire planetary computer consistently and indefinitely. Nuclear fusion energy? Perhaps, but I believe we are still decades away from building a commercial fusion reactor.At our current technological level, such a concept can only be imagined in science fiction or computer games.I cannot even imagine how much such an enterprise would cost, and if the world has enough spare money to fund it.And for what purpose? What could we possibly need that many FLOPS for?On the other hand, if we diverted the ginormous funds required for such a colossal undertaking to educate the 7.7 billion humans on Earth - to grant scholarships to all so each one can get one or two PhDs…Or, provide enough food for everyone so that nobody sleeps hungry ever…Or, find cures to cancer, Alzheimers, AIDS, COVID-19, or any other deadly disease that might emerge in the future…Or, since we’re dabbling in science fiction anyway, develop technologies to interconnect the human brain to the Internet and to each other, so we can achieve a planet-wide computer network at a fraction of the cost…Then the world would be a far greater place.Sources:",0 followers,Jared Cooke,2.9K,97,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-computer-be-built-as-big-as-a-planet

But on the other hand if there were only computers on the planet there would be no work to do., no projects to manage, no people to entertain, no point in having a computer.Cities and roads are that way to. If yu have 1% of the space made available for rodas then you can’t get around because of traffic jams. At 10% then the roads are 10X bigger and it goes well but if 100% of the space is taken up with roads then you have no place to go and there is no point. SO if the computer is the planet then there is nothing you need to compute. In both cases there is an optimal size. With computers you want then as small as possible and located right at the point where the computation is required.","9,918 followers",Brett Bergan,1.3K,7K,82.8M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-computer-be-built-as-big-as-a-planet

Aliens are specialized creatures who are used to their special environment. They depend upon their high-tech tools to survive. Humans, by comparison, have more imagination, ingenuity and can get by with fewer tools (although this is changing.)Also there is the notion that fatal flaws are present from the beginning. In the movie Forbidden Planet the advanced aliens were wiped out by their own machines which fed upon an ignored part of their brains.In Independence Day the aliens are psychic. They can read each other’s minds. Theirs is probably a society devoid of crime or secrets. Thus they built their computer systems with no regard to security or hacking, why would they need to?

Let me tell you of the Hrud.One of the few canon images of a HrudAside from being one of the ugliest creatures to crawl out of theThe Hrud are in essence, creatures out time. They possess a strange connection to reality, making them sometimes appear as shadowy or unidentifiable beings as though they are in many places at once. This also has a catastrophic effect on their surroundings. The Hrud innately possess an “entropic” field that causes rapid decay to set in on everything surrounding them. Boulders erode to sand. Water boils away into base hydrogen and oxygen. Livings things collapse into carbon dust. It’s as though everything the Hrud approach ages a million years and then some. Infuriatingly this makes in depth study of the Hrud and their culture (if they even have one) near impossible. Their goals, origins and anything remotely resembling factual information is bare and scarce.The best information on them comes from a series of battles, most notably the Cleansing of the Sak’trada Deeps during the final years of the Great Crusade. For some quick background, the Iron Warriors Space Marine Legion had been dispatched to the region of space as a massive congregation of billions of the xenos had been discovered there. It was the duty of the Iron Warriors to cleanse planets the Hrud held, no matter the cost.A Space Marine of the Iron Warriors Legion. For those not versed in Warhammer 40k. Space Marines are genetically augmented 8 ft tall super soldiers with access to incredibly powerful weapons, armor and physical ability. They make Captain America look like pre serum Steve Rogers.What happened next was an atrocious war. I’ll provide the highlights.So that’s what I think is the scariest alien race. A race that can’t be stopped, that ages everything around it into atoms and based particles of matter. A race that may yet out live the decay of the universe because they represent entropy itself.

And as an associate in a retail store, I see it all the time. Some ladies I see in the store at least once a week. Sometimes I’ll spend a lot of time discussing the pros and cons of various products and brands. Sooner or later, they end up buying something, and maybe lots of somethings.Shopping is an experience for many. They do it without any objective in mind. But if you take care of them, they will return, and they will buy stuff.",6 followers,Mats Andersson,3K,19.9K,366M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-computer-be-built-as-big-as-a-planet

They are —after all— in the business of selling shit. You are —after all— going in there to buy it. It’s totally logical that they’re trying to sell you as much as possible. (the only “ethical” issue I have with all of this is the hyper push to get people to sign up for credit cards when they shouldn’t)Generally, the biggest reasons for not making a purchase are controllable to a certain extent by the retailer:Those are the main issues with how the retail experience affects why consumers walk in and then walk out without buying. It’s worth noting that the retailer has little to no influence over a customer who just didn’t want anything. But for the most part, the above points are things that the retailers concern themselves with.","17,838 followers",Nikki Grayestone,746,2.6K,53.3M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-computer-be-built-as-big-as-a-planet

23,"Yes. When I was working at subway in high school, we’d have to close at ten, and I’d usually have homework and other stuff to do before I went to bed to go to school the next day. My coworkers were usually in the same boat, so we wanted to leave by like 10:10 at the latest, and there’s a lot to do before you close, so generally we’d have everything basically closed by like 9:50, leaving just putting the food away in the cooler and locking the door.

Unless you’re picking up an order that you already placed it’s not cool. Those people have places to go and things to do and probably just want to go to sleep. Your order will probably take more than 5 mins and so you shouldn’t come.","1,418 followers",Marlon Izzo,595,8.4K,14.3M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-computer-be-built-as-big-as-a-planet
24,When I go to a store and leave without buying something usually it’s because they didn’t have what I was looking for. If I was shopping for clothes maybe I didn’t find anything I liked or they didn’t have the size and/or color I needed. I may then go home and order it online. Sometimes I see something online and I go to the store to buy it but then realize I don’t like it in real life. Once in a while like at Walmart I get out of there because it’s just too crowded.,212 followers,Katie Faulk,4.3K,125,711.7K,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-learn-MATLAB-or-Python

And before you know it, you’ve spent another three hours in there, for which you are not getting paid.Similar principles apply to every job ever. When I was cleaning offices, I was under strict instruction never to clean anything that wasn’t in the specification—because if I did it once, they would complain if I didn’t always do it, and the demands would just continue to increase.
