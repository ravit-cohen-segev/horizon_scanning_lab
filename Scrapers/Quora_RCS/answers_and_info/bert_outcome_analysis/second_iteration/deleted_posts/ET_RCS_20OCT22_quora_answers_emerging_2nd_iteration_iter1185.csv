I’ve answered a similar question to this so I’m going to pull from what I’ve said before.While getting my degree in Communications, I concentrated in Media Technologies, and then I pursued a minor in just general history. I like history and did it because I knew I could take classes on topics that interest me. I wrote lots of papers in those history classes. It really improved my writing from what it was and I got to learn about things most people don’t. Win-Win.What’s surprised me the most is that all the things that I previously mentioned, most of which I did because I was interested in it. This degree has led me to a job that I never thought I would be in. I’m currently the Associate Editor for a local travel magazine. I started off as an intern writing some blogs. They let me make a list of things I knew about and then from that approved list, they let me write about what I wanted. This led to many blogs on random topics, but now I’m pretty much the lead writer for the magazine. My boss and I switch back and forth on who writes more.What I’m trying to say is, a communications degree can lead anywhere; law school, a magazine, the marketing department of a hospital. Do what interests you and you’ll find it may interest other people too. My magazine in particular liked that I had a minor in history rather than something traditional like photography. The experience I had with agriculture was helpful too.Being well-rounded is the way to go. Concentrating on just one specialty isn’t appealing in today’s job market. They’re looking for people who have knowledge in many or widely varying topics. I know that’s one of the reasons I was picked for that internship over others that had also interviewed. Use your time when your working on getting the degree to gain as much experience as possible and keep your options open. I always wanted to write and edit. I’m getting to now, but that doesn’t mean I want to keep working at this magazine for the rest of my life. A communications degree is very versatile, so play to your strengths and interests and see where it’ll take you.I hope this helps!",10 followers,Sajeev Rajan,1.7K,1.5K,46.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-with-a-communication-degree

The Triad remains one of the most secret criminal structures on the planet, and those who have suffered from it never go to the police, fearing imminent revenge. But the victims of the Triad in St. Petersburg went against this ancient tradition and decided to hand over the Chinese gangsters to justice. On October 19, 2020, a car stopped near one of the residential buildings on Nalichnaya Street in St. Petersburg. Three Chinese citizens came out of it - a young student and two of his friends. The company arrived at a meeting with compatriots with whom they had a conflict: a student interfered with serious business. The concept of this business was as follows: tourists from China regularly arrived in St. Petersburg. The guides sold them special coupons that allowed them to choose goods and eat, but only in Chinese cafes and shops. At the same time, prices there were much higher than the average for St. Petersburg.And it is quite possible that this dubious business would have continued to work without any failures, but the Chinese student intervened. He came to Petersburg, got a job with fellow countrymen and learned about the coupon scheme. Soon he told a tourist friend about it and warned that using coupons was completely unprofitable.A friend of the student decided that he needed to share important information, and told the whole tourist group about the trick with coupons. Its participants began to return coupons to guides and demand money back. And the student who divulged the gray scheme started receiving very unpleasant calls and messages from compatriots.Unknown persons demanded compensation from the young man for the damage caused, and then he decided to go to negotiations, taking a couple of comrades with him, just in case. But the student was not very worried: he was on the territory of a foreign country and was not afraid of problems with fellow countrymen here. Suddenly, three cars pulled up next to the company, and Chinese in dark jackets and sunglasses got out. One of them went up to the student and hit him hard in the stomach, from which he fell to the ground. His friends had their hands twisted, all three were loaded into cars and taken away in an unknown direction.Victims Explain That A Group Of 12 Criminals Kidnapped Them and Extorted 100,000 YuanSergey Kolesov. Investigator of the St. Petersburg Main Directorate of the Investigative Committee of RussiaThe hijackers took the abductees to a local Chinese club - with ethnic cuisine, recreation areas and, according to law enforcement officials, a brothel. The student and his friends were brought into one of the rooms of the club and there for several hours they demanded from them a guarantee of a quick payment of the debt. The abductees were intimidated, psychologically suppressed, insulted and periodically beaten with hands and feet. The hostages were ordered to call relatives in China and beg them to collect the ransom. As a result, at about midnight, the extortionists got their way: the hostages promised to pay the entire required amount in exchange for saving their lives and health. The victims turned to law enforcement agencies. The police officers first sent all three applicants to hospital. When they came to their senses, they told the operatives that, apparently, they had become victims of the local cell of the Chinese Triad. The victims of the Chinese gangsters agreed to testify against their kidnappers despite fear for their safety.In fact, this is the first case when it was possible to convince the Chinese to testify against those whom they have long called the Triad at home.Alexander. Criminal Investigation Officer of St. PetersburgOn the morning of January 26, police and FSB operatives, with the support of spetsnaz, detained five alleged hijackers, who, according to the investigation, were involved in the abduction of the student and his friends. The three detainees turned out to be only 21 to 23 years old - they said they were studying at Russian universities. But in which and at which faculties, the young people could not explain. Presumably, they were the combat wing of the St. Petersburg unit of the Triad - during the searches found homemade weapons and handcuffs. And the other two detainees were much more interesting. One of them - unemployed - previously worked as a guide to the palaces of St. Petersburg: he conducted excursions for Chinese citizens and helped with the accommodation of tourists in hotels. And the second, Chinese citizen Hui Wang, is believed in the criminal investigation department of St. Petersburg, was a consultant to the group on legal issues and, possibly, one of its leaders.Hui Wang is a citizen of the People's Republic of China and an active lawyer. He studied in St. Petersburg, received a higher legal education. Hui Wang trained with the president of the Bar Association, after which he received the status of a lawyer and dealt with legal issues between businessmen from the PRC and RussiaSergey Kolesov. Investigator of the St. Petersburg Main Directorate of the Investigative Committee of RussiaAccording to law enforcement agencies, members of the Triad in St. Petersburg allowed themselves a lot: they visited elite restaurants and owned a whole fleet of expensive cars, four unemployed detainees and one lawyer were found by investigators BMW X7, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, Land Rover, Mercedes and Infiniti ...Hui Wang (left)The investigation is confident that the group is responsible for numerous crimes against the Chinese, who, as a rule, do not oppose their compatriots associated with crime. The fact is that all the gangsters from the Triad, wherever they are, have strong connections in China. The relatives of the victims live there, who may be in danger if their loved ones go against the mafia.detention of one of the alleged members of the TriadToday, the investigation into the case of the alleged members of the Triad detained in St. Petersburg continues. Investigators are identifying everyone who could have suffered at the hands of Chinese gangsters, and the biographies of the detainees are carefully studied, including with the help of Interpol. Investigators do not exclude that only part of the members of a large ethnic group operating in the Leningrad Region fell into their hands.Meanwhile, the detainees themselves are in no hurry to communicate with the investigation: the lawyer Hui Wang, a member of the Baltic Bar Association, has completely forgotten the Russian language, having ended up in the hands of law enforcement agencies. Five very high-class colleagues came to his defense and demanded that Hui Wang be placed under house arrest. But the court decided otherwise - and today the alleged member of the Triad is in jail, where he is awaiting his further fate.","4,123 followers",Boris Sanochkin,1.4K,5.4K,26.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-with-a-communication-degree
