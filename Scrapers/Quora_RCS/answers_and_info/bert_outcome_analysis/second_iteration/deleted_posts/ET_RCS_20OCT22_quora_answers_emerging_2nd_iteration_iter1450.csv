If you want to work there, you can visit the CIA website — it is clear and specific about what it seeks in new employees in terms of moral character, education, and experience — and scout around for specific jobs or areas in which you think you might be interested and for which you think you might be qualified. Most people, probably including you, don’t know much about the nuts and bolts of intelligence work (and lots of what you think you know ain’t so), so don’t completely rule out other possibilities. If done right, the way the CIA and many other agencies specializing in brainwork expect, this scouting trip should take you several hours, and allow you to gauge whether the CIA is likely to want what you have to offer, as well as whether any of the positions for which you might qualify interest you enough to apply for them.Understand that the CIA wants to hire lifers — people who expect to make working at the CIA their job for at least the next 20 to 30 years — and turn them into professional intelligence officers. Many new hires, especially operations officers, spend their first two or three years just learning about intelligence and security issues in general, how the CIA fits into the rest of the Intelligence Community, and the different functions of the various elements of the CIA. Of course they also learn about tradecraft and practice what their own jobs will entail, and many study a foreign language, as well. The CIA doesn’t expect to get much useful work from them until after that introductory period. It will usually be years before the CIA gets a full return from what it invests in them at the very beginning.Understand also that once on board you are not required to spend your entire career in the discipline or even directorate you began in. If after a few years or even a dozen years, you think you would be happier or more productive in another line of work, it is possible to change jobs if another office would accept you. A good number of ops officers end up as reports officers, or support officers, or analysts (as I did), for example.Only after you have taken on board all of the information you can should you actually apply for a job. At this point find the section entitled Application Process and do exactly what it says. if you submit an application, you will receive a response, if only a polite letter thanking you for your interest but informing you that the CIA doesn’t want to hire you. If the CIA is interested, you enter a gauntlet.First, you will be invited for an interview. If you do well at that, you then face a gamut of tests, including an intelligence test and perhaps some aptitude tests, as well as an arduous polygraph examination (don’t even think about lying or evading or shading your answers). If you get through all that, you are sent home to wait, while a detailed background investigation is performed. It may take months to complete, and will, among other things include interviews with members of your family and close relatives, people at places where you worked, or whom you named as references, and so on.If you decide to proceed down this path, good luck.","91,436 followers",Roland Bartetzko,995,3.4K,313.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-join-the-CIA

That being said, I obviously have other friends and acquaintances who took this walk. Over the years, I have noticed a few things about the people who are truly successful in the fields of intelligence and special operations.First and foremost, the people who are really successful in intelligence and special operations decided at a young age that this was something they wanted to pursue. Not only that, they had the foresight to take steps to be competitive in the field.I personally decided that I wanted to be in special operations when I was about 12 or 13. Around that age, I took up wrestling as a sport and competed until I finished high school. I had the foresight to take up a sport that prepares people well for a career in special operations.Likewise, I was interested in learning Russian. Despite being ethnically Russian, I didn’t grow up speaking it. I was a good student in middle school, so I decided to try my luck at getting a scholarship to a boarding school that taught Russian, and just my luck, I was admitted to one. In college, I followed up by majoring in Russian studies.Likewise, throughout my high school years, I spent my summers reading books about military history and military theory to prepare myself for the day that I would eventually step on the battlefield.As a result, by the time I graduated college, I had already been working towards a career in intelligence and special operati...",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,935,21.7K,235.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-join-the-CIA

The below is focused solely on---What is it like?Before I tell people how to get a job in intelligence, I help them figure out whether it’s a job they’ll actually enjoy. Many people are attracted to the Intelligence Community because of its depictions in popular culture. That’s fine. But if you want a lasting career in intelligence analysis, you need to get past the superficial intrigue and be happy with the desk job that remains.Intelligence analysis is a research job, pure and simple.Your subject of focus won’t necessarily be a matter of public interest. You might work on terrorism. Then again, you could end up working on something like Ukrainian ethnography.Why would the U.S. Government devote resources to Ukrainian ethnography when the current threat is Islamic extremism? The reason is important to understanding your role as an intelligence analyst: The primary point of intelligence analysis is not to defeat current threats. Instead, it is to foresee, prepare for, and prevent tomorrow’s threats. The Intelligence Community works for policymakers and military leaders. First, the intelligence apparatus produces assessments about global security threats–some immediately critical to US security, some not. Policymakers read the assessments of the immediate threats, then decide on a course of action: call a foreign leader, make a speech, inform Congress, drop a bomb, etc. The assessments about the non-critical issues are mostly ignored by policymakers. These people are very busy, and have time only for two things: things that will be in tomorrow’s headlines, and things that will be headlines unless the policymakers do something about it. Everything else gets largely ignored.But when the next unforeseen threat arrives, it’s very important that the policymakers have immediate access to expertise–expertise attained through years of quiet research that, until now, received little attention. In order to ensure that this expertise is available, the Intelligence Community focuses on all sorts of subjects that, while not in today’s headlines, may become the next major threat.Some of these subjects may never get widespread attention during your career. This means that in addition to liking the slog, you have to be content knowing that your hard work may never get any attention from policymakers. You are, in effect, being paid a professional salary to write doctoral theses that few people will ever read. Another way to look at it is that the US Government is subsidizing your intellectual curiosities in order to keep you on retainer, just in case your subject becomes the root of a national security threat.Develop the right skillsThe sole requirement.I entered college ignorant to the importance of writing. A few key classes changed that, simply by forcing me to compile primary sources, state a thesis, and write a paper supporting that thesis. If you are in college and you want to be an intelligence analyst, focus your curriculum on classes that require you to do this–seminars, laboratories, independent study, etc–as opposed to test-driven, lecture-based courses. The exact subject matter is less important. Chemistry research, history research, Ukrainian ethnography research…it’s all of interest to the Intelligence Community. (Remember: even if it’s not a current threat, they want to be prepared for all possibilities.) If you can gather facts and communicate what those facts mean, you can be an intelligence analyst. Everything else on your résumé is icing.Icing.Some subjects–particularly technical ones–will always be in demand:Books.Get Noticed.Fortunately, because you took college courses that require original research, you have a portfolio of work that proves you have writing skills. Don’t hide your proof. Publish it online. This is the single most important thing you can do to help yourself stand out from everyone else. Don’t worry that your papers aren’t good enough; after all, you aren’t a professional yet. The reader will understand that. Managers seeking recent graduates want to see initiative, curiosity, and potential.Publishing online used to be hard. That’s not true anymore. If you’re reading this, you can put your research online in under an hour for no fee. Do it. Then provide links in your résumé.(After you update your résumé with links to writing samples, get your résumé into the hands of a person who physically works at the agency you want to work for.Note: Many government agencies centralize their recruiting instead of letting individual teams do their own. This means that if you apply for a job online through the standard procedure, your application will go to someone who has no idea what you do or whether you’re good at it. Go ahead and fill out the official application. It can’t hurt. But your time is better spent finding someone on the inside who loves your skills and will advocate for you.How do you find such a person? Visit career fairs, use your alumni network, and look for connections on LinkedIn. (I have personally never gotten any value out of LinkedIn, but it is extremely popular in DC. One caveat: most people in intelligence do not advertise their affiliation on social networks.) If you make contact with anyone, send them your résumé and make sure they see your research portfolio. (Caveat: just because a hiring manager wants to hire you, it doesn’t mean they can. The federal hiring process is byzantine. The reasons why merit their own write-up. But the benefits of being known to the hiring manager are invaluable.)A word about intelligence analysis masters programs.Why? Because intelligence analysis isn’t a skill. Research is a skill, and it can be learned in all sorts of different college-level courses. Intelligence, on the other hand, is a practice. And a practice is really best learned on the job.Will an intelligence analysis degree teach you how to do research? Maybe. But: 1) so will lots of other undergraduate programs, many of which will give you more flexibility as your career preferences evolve, and 2) an intelligence program will probably try to teach you about the bureaucratic machinations of the U.S. Intelligence Community; such things are really best learned on the ground.For example, one such program’s web site claims that its Bachelors recipients will graduate knowing how to:1 can be learned by reading a few books. 6 is something best learned on the job (because the processes and practices will vary from agency to agency). 2-5 are basic research skills that you should learn in any seminar-intensive college curriculum. Specifically, 5 is a fancy way of saying, “Use the library.” That’s no small feat–most people never come close to understanding all the tools offered by a modern library–but this should be a goal in any research-intensive undergraduate program.Two caveats:As I said at the beginning, this advice is heavily biased by my own experience. Different intelligence analysts have learned different lessons. Neither of us are wrong. But the above advice worked for me.","16,033 followers",Pavel Fekula,2.4K,11K,118.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-join-the-CIA

In a moment it may have no purpose at all. Just passing the time. Yet in doing so you are making yourself known to the other, and they to you - here’s purpose, but it doesn’t need to be consciously-held by either of you to fulfill itself. We may speak “for no reason,” pure whim, yet what we are giving illuminates who we are. There is purpose there if we want it, yet sometimes it goes better without. Just let the moment be, and unfold within it.Speaking carelessly can sometimes lead to misspeaking, or saying frivolous or undesirable things. A tightened focus on purpose -To think as if all speech has one purpose, though, will only confound you in your attempts to understand others - when this is not a purpose they have in mind. Purpose is chosen. Even if we can discern “purpose” in terms of mere function after-the-fact, purpose in the moment is either absent or aimed.It makes a big difference what purpose you choose. Whether you speak to a purpose or purposelessly. Yet let your purpose be chosen and directed by goals and desires you know. Then your purpose for speech will serve you - and in various situations, it will be various purposes to serve you variously.","5,228 followers",Tanvi Dinesh Sharma,24.1K,56,810.8K,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-join-the-CIA

We, in any way couldn't ever believe what, why and how this has happened to a person whose lifestyle is exceptionally healthy and has done nothing but to serve people all this while.But we didn't lose hope. He didn't lose hope. He fought with the cancer. Went through the painful treatment, the chemotherapies, but never lost his smile. Not even an inch of it. I never saw such a dedicated person like him. When he was in the hospital and he was on high dosages of certain chemotherapy drugs, side effects of which were hallucinations. He, even in his hallucinations, was concerned about his patients.It was like every day we were dying. We could see it coming everyday, but we didn't lose hope.And he did recover! He got into remission. He was getting better. He lost his hair due to the side effects of the chemotherapy drugs, but he still looked so handsome.He came back home. Started to work again. We asked him not to do so much of work after such an illness. He said,He again started working 14–16hrs a day!He as usual enjoyed it so much. It was all like a happy dream for us again. We were more than happy in our little family of four.He used to motivate everyone regarding how he survived his illness, and how positivity helped him. His lifestyle became more of a perfect lifestyle one should have.Not just me, my family, the whole city and even the adjacent towns, villages couldn't get over him.[May 2010]We never thought, such a day would ever come in our lives again. Papa again started to develop some of the symptoms. He got his lab tests done.It was a relapse.Back to everything, which haunted us. Back to the start point, to reach the end.This time it was severe. Incurable.The oncologist said, Dad had 10–15% chances of survival and should stop taking any expensive treatment and forget all the hopes. My dad, stood up, and saidWe came out of the chamber.We all were hiding the storm we were facing inside our minds and the truth we knew about.He went for the chemotherapy again.Extremely Painful and Exhausting it was.We were dying each day. Not just him, all four of us.I was in 12th grade and my sister in 5th. We knew what is happening and what could happen at any second of our lives.But we fought.He one day called us and asked us to promise him that, whatever happens, even if we are in extreme pain and agony, we shouldn't stop smiling. We were crying at that time and saidHe could never quit. He used to laugh out loud, tell jokes, funny stories to all the people around him, the doctors, the nurses. They too became his fans. Everybody used to burst into laughter, including us. Laughed so much that tears used to roll down our face. But these tears were of sadness not of the laughter.He wasn't a quitter. And so he didn't quit. So atlast, life has to quit. Cancer has to leave his body but with him.19th December 2010.Worst day of my life. The day was death to all three of us. It wasn't just us 3 who lost him but all the people, literally hundreds of them, they cried. They lost hope in positivity.Even I did. I lost hope in life.But my Mother. She grabbed me and said, 'You're the daughter of a person who wasn't even scared of death, who was never a pessimist in his life. So you cannot afford losing yourself in pain. If you've pain, give it a direction, just like your father. Stand up for him, and for the people who have faith in him.’I had two options in my life- First, I could either cry all the time, and die one day, because clearly I couldn't live a day without him. Survival without him was impossible.Or the Second option, Be like him. Follow him. Never ever forget him, never get him out of my eyes and let him go.I chose the second option.I thought I could never live without him, I would die. But I didn't. If I could pass that one day without him, then, that clearly means, I wouldn't Die without him. I have to live and I must, because Life goes on.So I decided to dedicate my life to my Father.I was a student of Maths stream, I just had - Physics, Chemistry and Maths in my highers. Because I never had such a dream of being a doctor. As and when I gave my 12th board exams in March 2011, I decided I would change my stream entirely and wanted to become a doctor just like him, even if I had to repeat my 11th and 12th.But I got to know about NIOS (National Institute Of Open Schooling) so dropped for an year, opted biology, gave combined exam of 11th and 12th Biology in an year from this board of education, and in 2012, got admitted in a Medical College.I survived. I didn't quit. Just like my Dad and my Mother and my sister.And, this is the purpose of my life. To be a Doctor. Just like my father. I would be glad, if in my life I could become even 1% of what he was.He is still with me. Because I made him my purpose. I keep him in my thoughts, my attitude. I take my decisions the way he used to take. I truly copy him. I'm his biggest fan!I love my Father. He's the reason I'm alive. To be like him is the purpose of my life.A heartfelt thanks to everyone who read my story.
