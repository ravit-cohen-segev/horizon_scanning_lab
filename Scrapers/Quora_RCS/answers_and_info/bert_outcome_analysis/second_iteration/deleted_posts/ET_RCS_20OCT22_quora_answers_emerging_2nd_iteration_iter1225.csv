I “escaped” China as they began closing roads, quarantining cities, and just before airports began to close in early February. I escaped to come home to the US, and what I thought would be a better prepared and significantly more efficient CDC.I left a country where politicians where downplaying the virus because they did not want to lose money during Spring Festival. I came home to a country where politicians want to downplay the virus to keep the stock market high.I left a country where politicians suppressed experts in telling the people the seriousness of the virus. I came home to a country trying to suppress experts in telling people the seriousness of the virus.I left a country who favored politics over science. I came home to a country that favors politics over science.I left a country where the president told the people that he was on top of the situation, even though it was two weeks before quarantines were enforced (if he truly was aware on January 7th). I came home to a country where the president told the people that he is on top of the situation, but has basically done nothing in the month prior to a breakout situation.I left a country where military build-up is more important than basic health care. I have come home to a country where military supremacy is more important than basic health care.So how would I have handled the virus - the exact opposite in the way the President handled it. Start early, prepare, put the most knowledgeable in charge, not cut the CDC budget for the prior two years, not wait until it was an emergency to take action - basically just about everything.","16,962 followers",Christian Winter,1.8K,18.4K,79M,https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-have-handled-the-coronavirus-differently-from-Donald-Trump

While he seems to believe he knows more about everything than anyone else, this is evidently not the case. The bigger problem however is, that he is also a bad manager, since he doesn’t acknowledge that other people know better and he maybe should turn to them for advice.And BTW setting up a task force led by Mike Pence whose primary occupation is prayer isn’t the right strategy either.People blame Trump for ignoring experts, bullshitting his way through this all.

7,"Here is a list of things that would have been very appropriate and intelligent things to do in response to Covid-19, none of which the Trump Administration did.Here is a list of things that would have been very appropriate and intelligent things to do in response to Covid-19, none of which the Trump Administration did.Now everything I’ve listed so far is stuff you do BEFORE anyone in the administration even knows how to spell “coronavirus” let alone knowing Wuhan has a crisis. This is all pandemic-101 stuff. And the Trump Administration flunked all of it—every single thing I’ve mentioned.Now let’s talk about what happens when one of the CDC flu spotting stations in China gets a report from a doctor (let’s call him….Li Wenliang) complaining that the government won’t listen to him about this new type of flu. Let me eliminate the suspense and just tell you that everything I’m about to list about what you do once you get a hint this is happening—is stuff the Trump Administration has done poorly on.6. You don’t cut off access to China—you rush people in. You get additional CDC and NIH talent in China. This isn’t a variation on the normal flu. China is the hothouse for this stuff—the flu season starts with them, that’s why CDC has flu spotting stations there—to get a jump on the flu and begin development of a flu shot early. Except this isn’t influenza. But with teams on the ground quickly, getting samples, observing what the Chinese are going, trying to nail down this bad boy as quickly as possible—that is what you do as soon as you hear a unsubstantiated rumor coming out of Asia. Ditto with Iran (more on this later). Ditto with Italy. It’s critical to get a reliable test nailed down and then start testing like crazy. Why? Because the first most critical step in dealing with pandemics before they become a pandemic is: INFORMATION. We were late on this. The USG didn’t get started on a test until late (we were relying on China, rather than pushing our people out in to the field we were cutting off access) and then when we got a test we only tested people returning from China. Information tells you what kind of beast you’re dealing with, how to deal with it, how widespread it likely is, who’s must vulnerable. It all starts with information and that only happens if, at the first hint of a problem, you push people in to the infected areas rather than cutting them off.7. Set up a task force to coordinate the gathering and sharing of the research from the field plus interact with various agencies (DoD, DHS, CDC, NIH, CIA, DoS, USAID, FBI, Customs, TSA, FDA, USAMRID, US Surgeon General—who has been invisible through all this mess by the way—and I’m sure I’ve left about 12–15 other offices or agencies off the list) to coordinate who is doing what, what supplies are being acquired, begin briefing states and governors and their health directors. This action should have started within a week of the first cases coming out of Wuhan. And the head of this task force should be a research or medical professional. Fauci is a good person to go with—he’s fought this fight before and has bi-partisan credibility. The head of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (Nancy Messionier) would also be a great choice. I’d probably avoid the head of USAMRID (Col. Darrin Cox) because he’s active duty US military that would feed wild conspiracy rumors that this is somehow a Chinese/American/Israeli bioweapon. But Carl Shaia who retired there back in the Fall was the former Director of Administration (but is now a civilian) and he’d do a bang-up job managing a task force of a lot of government people dealing with complex, unplanned health and medical issues—if you felt like you didn’t want to pull Fauci or Messionier from their organizations (because their supervision of their work was too vital) than Shaia could be a good option. If the head of DHS or HHS was someone with public healthcare expertise then they’d be a fallback option. We don’t currently have an actual DHS head (that position is vacant) and the acting person (formerly of TSA) Chad Wolf has no background in this issue. Alex Azar (HHS) is a lawyer and worked in healthcare organizations but frankly wouldn’t be a strong choice in terms of knowing the public healthcare players. Picking Mike Pence is a poor choice. He double-screwed up the HIV mini-epidemic in Indiana (first cutting support for PP, then refusing to follow the data and wouldn’t do a needle exchange until the cases had exploded). Pence isn’t the worst choice—as a governor he’s got background in dealing with emergencies (in his case: floods and tornados) so that’s a positive plus he’s pretty high up. Still, with a little bit of research (ie: 4 hours) I could give you about 200 names of people who would be a better choice than Pence.8. What Donald Trump says. Now if you really want to know the optimal approach here, it would be that Donald Trump never says or tweets anything about Covid-19 or the Coronavirus at all—when asked about it he refers to the head of the taskforce and then shuts up. That would be optimal. But if we can’t have that, then it would be that he says NOTHING in any media form without clearing it first with a senior healthcare SME (subject matter expert). This post is already too long for me to list all the things he’s said so far that are dumb or false: the virus would go away in April because of temperatures (tell that to Singapore, plus there is a new paper out of the Harvard epidemiology Dept. that says this virus doesn’t seem be affected by warmer temps), that the WHO death rate was wrong (not what he should have said), that Democrats are trying to make this a scare tactic to win the election, that there was nothing to worry about. Donald Trump has added probably not one piece of value to this whole issue—just confusion or wrong information plus delays. I mean, suggesting we should seal the border with Mexico: they have 5 cases as of yesterday and 3 of them came from exposure to foreigners (Italy and America)—I think Mexico might want to seal their border for protection from the US! If you could cut him out of the picture and he’d tolerate that from Day One, things would be so much better now.9. Policy on cruise ships: have one. Right now the US does not and is scrambling. Think about that—there have already been a couple of cases of passengers on cruise ships with Covid-19 signs, why hasn’t the US developed a policy for what to do other than tell the ship to stay offshore? We knew this was an issue a month ago and we’ve got ships off the US coast that we’re trying to figure out what to do because there is no policy in-place. This is exactly what the USG is supposed to do—establish policies. And I said cruise ships because that’s an immediate issue. Someone is going to have a 14 hour plane flight and in the middle of the flight (with air being circulated through the cabin) it will be clear that a passenger is sick with the coronavirus—so what’s the procedure? Have them disembark and stand in line at a crowded customs and immigration portal with hundreds of other incoming passengers? Every single US airport that has an international terminal needs to be setting up infrastructure and implementing USG policy (except there is none) besides setting up hand sanitizer and putting out more tissue dispensers.10. Establish and follow basic risk protocols for individuals who are exposed or possibly exposed re-entering the country. The healthcare workers who met the plane load of sick and at-risk Americans returning to the US—none of them had any kind of protection or established procedure for processing those individuals. WTF? This sounds like an isolated example. There will be hundreds of thousands of Americans seeking to return back to the US from overseas. Students, business professionals, tourists, retirees, military, diplomats, USG workers, professors. You need a basic protocol for screening and handling them (and it’s not all the same—it will vary with the country they’re coming from, if they’ve been tested, if they have obvious signs, if they’d had contact). That doesn’t exist right now.11. Information is critical at times like this—to avoid panic. You don’t want to downplay it all, you need to be open and honest but put things in perspective. So for instance, people need to be told that you should not be wearing a mask unless you’re sick (wearing a mask INCREASES the likelihood you get infection if you’re exposed to someone) unless you change your mask every hour (or every encounter). In the effort to downplay the spread and infection, there is very little (okay, none) Federal govt. resources talking publicly about “let’s talk through planning for if schools in most of the country shut down for a month—can we get all businesses to give people temporary family leave?” Local governments are working on this (kudos to them) but they’re often having to do this in the dark. The Feds should be driving this and be pre-eminent. What Jay Inslee (gov. of Washington State) had to tell Pence is sad, just appalling but that’s a reflection on the Federal coordination effort to-date. So information not only about “this is what we know, this is what we don’t know, here’s what you should be doing know, here’s what you should plan for just in-case” is critical and it’s not happening. That’s not really happening publicly driven by the Feds, it’s very piecemeal and fragments. Look at the comments from Carson (HUD). He shouldn’t be in the public eye on this except the Trump information shortage/gap has people hungry for information and since he was a surgeon, he got approached by media. So he was asked about the Trump policy on the cruise ship approaching the US and he said it was finalized but it wasn’t going to be revealed yet. Then he said it was formulated but some details were being worked out. Then he said there were no plans as of yet. This is from one senior Administration official within one 24 hour period who shouldn’t even be talking about cruise ships. And this happens because there is no coordination or reliable information source on this issue at the moment. So people are going all over the place seeking information.12. There are a gazillion specialty situations that need to be addressed by government. If you’ve got a kid overseas in an exchange program (say—studying art in Milan, or teaching English in Beijing), can they come back home? Or what if they wait till the end of the semester? What about US military? What about large crowds at sporting events—any policy or recommendations regarding those? I bet every police officer out there is now wondering “hmmm….how does this affect me and possible infected people or areas?” Could you imagine medical professionals or first responders refusing to go out in the field if we have a shortage of gloves and masks? Certain industries (any place like Orlando that does a lot of conventions), cruise ships, airlines, travel, tourism, caterers, restaurants—they’re likely dealing with tremendous business crashes right now or in the near future. Saying “we’ll give you a tax break” is a crappy answer—that’s not what they need right now. Their immediate concern is about safety and a tax break doesn’t address that. They need to be given some direction on what to expect, how the USG is going to intervene, if there will be tests set up when people board/deplane/disembark. These are issues that industry can’t solve or fix and a tax break is irrelevant to. And we aren’t even talking about jobs like TSA that involve touching a lots of things. The latest word I’ve heard is that Covid-19 can live for up to a week on a surface. So any high-traffic screening personnel would be a great risk-2,000 people could come through your shift and it only takes one to pass on something (because of a suitcase they brought from home where an asymptomatic individual—not the traveler—coughed on it).13. This is related to #11 but you need to balance the panic and the information. You should not be trying to “spin” this event or push good news. Right now, the Trump Administration has tried hard to downplay this and say it is something that will go away quickly with little pain. Meanwhile the markets are taking deep dives, Italy is quarantining 15 million people, and the Fed issues an unprecedented emergency rate cut while the President is saying “no biggie.” Let me let you in on something: our numbers on infections in the US are bogus. We’ve mostly been testing only people who were traveling overseas or those immediately next to someone who’s infected. Partially that was lack of planning, partially that was a lack of test availability. Once we expand the number of tests, you’re going to see the number of people with a “positive” result (meaning: they got it or have antibodies so were exposed and may be a carrier) to probably go up 5X the current number (if not higher). That’s to be expected—we had artificially low numbers previously. But to fearful members of the public, it will seem like their government was lying to them or that all of sudden the virus has gotten really bad when it hit the US (neither case was true). That’s why the mis-statements by the Trump Administration and the efforts to downplay this sucker are just stupid, stupid, stupid. You’ve got a balancing act—it’s tough—but it’s critical. You’ve got to level with people, talk about what we know, what we don’t know, talk a little about an unknown future. When you try to downplay or minimize the bad news, and then you suddenly get a bunch of bad news, you lose your credibility. You don’t just look bad, instead you become the bad guy.14. Protecting Asians and Immigrants. The Trump Administration is probably the least credible and competent governmental entity to engage in this. You’re already seeing individuals verbally or physically attacking Asians. People who are 2nd generation US and from Japan or the Philippines are being told to go back to China. After 9–11, George W. Bush gave a very powerful speech where he said we were all Americans, we couldn’t turn on each other, that it should still be safe for someone wearing a hijab to go to a mosque, and it was shameful for us to betray our values by turning on minorities. At a time when there are a ton of rumors, lots of fear, it’s important for our government to do something that they’re very capable of doing—standing up for targeted minorities and letting people know “hey, they’re not the danger here.” Seriously—this is a “no-brainer” kind of action because the USG is well positioned to deal with it, can do it RIGHT NOW, and variations of this come up whenever there is a terrorist attack, a pandemic, a violent crime or something that stereotypes a specific group. And it doesn’t require scientists coming up with a new vaccine or some medical advance. it’s about USG leadership saying “hey—no scapegoating, we’re all in this together, don’t turn on each other.” Has anyone seen anything from Trump or Pence or any senior USG official addressing this issue? I haven’t.15. Do not rely on information from Xi. China has not handled it well, they were initially in denial. Xi basically told Trump “nothing to worry about, it’s going to go away” and then Trump came out with his “it will disappear in April” statement. Let healthcare professionals talk to their foreign counterparts—they’ll be able to decipher what is bullish*t and what is truth.16. South Korea: we should have teams over there right now looking at what they’re doing. ROK isn’t perfect but they’re a great example of getting it “mostly” right. They’ve got drive-in stations for quick tests to see if you’re contagious or not. From the git-go they were testing far more people than just international travelers—making us look like idiots. South Korea hasn’t been perfect but they’ve been pretty darn good. I bet that right now, we’re so focused on the US that any potential lessons or tips we might gain from ROK are going to be ignored until this thing plays itself out and a year or so from now we’re doing a “hot wash” and go “gee, wouldn’t it have been smart if we’d implemented this thing they tried in South Korea?”17. Do not, do not, use the Coronavirus as an excuse to implement other policies you have. The Trump Administration has already tightened immigration rules with Iran (actually, we should be sending CDC teams there to see what we can learn and also identify if it’s the same strain). Trump has talked about closing the border with Mexico (but not Canada which has far more cases—although a significant number came from exposure to Americans—sorry Canada!). Do you hear any talk of closing immigration with Italy (which is attempting to quarantine 15 million of its’ citizens)? Nope, neither have I. You see, the problem when you do stunts like this (sneak in another policy using the rationale of it’s dealing with Covid-19) is it ends up hurting your credibility and perceived confidence across the board. If shutting down borders is “the answer” then why shut off a border with Mexico but not Canada? If shutting down borders is “the answer” then why allow trucks full of auto parts from Mexico to still come in to the US (answer: it would shut down nearly all US auto manufacturing plants and immediately lead to a recession plus kill Trump in a bunch of battleground states like Michigan that he needs to win).18. This last piece is tough to do but it’s now essential: we need to flatten the curve and expand capacity ASAP. Let me explain the concept: the US healthcare system is near capacity. We don’t have a lot of empty beds. We have fewer doctors (especially in rural areas) per capita then places like Italy. Our ICU’s are maxed out mostly (in part due to a very bad flu season). A massive influx of new Covid-19 cases is a healthcare disaster. It doesn’t matter if the case mortality rate for infections is only 1% (or .2%) rather than 3.5%. You end up with not enough ventilators, not enough ICU beds, not enough healthcare providers. And while the extreme Covid-19 cases (about 4–10% of those infected) are in ICUs, other patients are either underserved or don’t get help. Seriously folks, with every epidemic the public healthcare data shows an increase in mortality for healthcare issues not related to the pandemic. So if you’re a healthcare administrator, you should be doing whatever you can to add beds, bring people out of retirement, add interns or admin support to free up nurses from work that someone without a degree can do. In terms of the Trump administration (ie: this question), they should be pushing all strategies to add capacity. And we (as an administration) should be looking at ways to “flatten the curve” by reducing the speed of infection. This chart is from Vox and Christina Animashaun and it illustrates why Covid-19 is got a lot of public healthcare folks alarmed, why you’re seeing so many Universities and localities canceling events and what the Federal Government needs to be focusing on much more than it currently is.I’m sure I’m leaving out a couple of other things but this post is long enough as is. Quite simply, the Trump Administration has done a terrible job preparing for a pandemic and then responding to the initial news and then acting when it hit the US.Let me say one last thing here: some people will write this post off as being “anti-Trump.” Preparing for disasters (diseases, natural emergencies, energy blackouts, rioting, etc.) is a special kind of challenge. We have professionals who do this stuff for a living. It absolutely infuriates me when we violate some of the most basic rules of disaster planning and emergency management—whether it’s with storms or pandemics. If this post comes off as “anti-Trump” it’s only because the Administration has badly bungled their response to the coronavirus. We had a reasonable shot at containing this sucker.

We are forced to be dependent on it for work, and it is completely unreliable. What my computer did today, it might not be capable of doing tomorrow, even though I make no changes. This makes time management impossible.9. Suppliers blame other suppliers for problems. “Oh, that’s a software issue.” “No that’s a hardware issue.” “That’s a problem with your Internet supplier.” “No, that must be because of your computer.” I don’t CARE whose fault it is; I just need it to work. Apple Care is the exception to this rule and is the MAIN reason I prefer Apple computers.10. There are never any instructions, and getting help from Web browser companies is impossible.11. It is a gross invasion of privacy. Corporations can track the pages we visit. We can’t be sure whether we’re being electronically monitored in any situation. A lawsuit was filed because a public school supplied laptops for students and rigged them to allow them to watch students whenever the computer was turned on, even if they were in their rooms undressing. Sounds like kiddy porn to me.12. The Internet is full of lies, and people are not taught to distinguish between fact and opinion. Anyone can pretend to be anyone they want and post “expert” opinion, even if it’s all made up. I don’t allow students to use Web pages as sources because much of the “information” on the Internet has been has not been confirmed, and is unreliable.I actually have many, many more reasons that I hate it, but those are the ones I can think of right off the top of my head. Yes, there are many advantages to technology, but the disadvantages outweigh them. Tech increases stress, and as you folks age, you’ll discover how DEADLY that is, not to mention the implications for our future of the horrible corporate attitude toward consumers and the decline of literacy skills. (If graphics work as well as language, why did we ever stop simply communicating through cave wall paintings?) A picture is a picture no matter whether it’s on a cave wall or is rendered on a computer.

The first building was on fire.Literally within one minute every TV in the place, which were all tuned to different channels, showed the same thing. And everyone in the gym stopped what they were doing and stared at the closest TV.I was standing on the elliptical, but not using it, when the second plane hit.After that, my memory jumps to sitting in the gym’s lobby, where there was a much bigger TV, with a bunch of people when the first building fell. I was showered and dressed and ready for my morning class, but I don’t remember doing those things.Then a campus security guard told everyone in the gym that all classes were canceled for the day.This was Chicago, and there were worries all morning that we were a target too.

I didn’t. I don’t remember why I didn’t go, but I made the right choice. They ended up waiting in line for six hours to give blood. I wouldn’t have been able to stay anyway.

I've never been there and I was not a witness any more than most Americans today. I was just an American like so many millions of others that day. In September of 2001 I was a sophomore in high school. I grew up in a small town in Southern Oklahoma. We're just the place where people fill up on gas and stretch their legs between Oklahoma City and Dallas. There were barely more than three thousand people in my whole town. My town was quiet and isolated from the problems of the outside world. Rain or the lack of it was the biggest concern anyone really had.That morning started off normal enough. It was uneventful to the point that I don't remember any of it right up until my teacher called for our attention.I was sitting in the art room staring at a picture that a classmate had drawn that was now hanging on the wall next to the ribbon it had won in a local art competition last year. It was a character from a video game that was popular at the time. It won because it was presented in multimedia format. One image sketched freehand and the other drawn using microsoft paint. It wasn't that it was bad, but I hated it. It won because at that time no one in my little part of the world ever attempted computer graphics in high school. I had done it for a few years and I thought it would be a good way to win. When I tried to work up an image that I thought was great because it was done digitally my teacher thought it was good, but needed to be painted... which wasn't the point. The painting wasn't that impressive and didn't do well at the competition, but his caricature did. I was annoyed. I even liked the kid who did it, but this morning I just sat there leaning back being annoyed at his picture. That was really the most important thing going on in my world at that moment. It was about 9:00 in the morning for me.This last paragraph seems unimportant, but I think it is to tell the story. These were the last thoughts I had before the first tower was hit. They were shallow and vapid. Childish. They were small. They focused on a world with few ramifications and one that in hindsight didn't matter at all. It was just a more simple and innocent time to be a child.That was the moment the art teacher came into the room.He said with a startled tone in his voice, ""A plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center.""For just a moment I was alarmed, but then thought to myself,""Who cares? Why is this a big deal?""I remember thinking that this was all about a little single engine propeller plane that some idiot crashed on a joyride through the city. To be honest I didn't even know what city we were talking about. I had no idea the scale and shape of the events that were taking place that morning. I went back to staring at the wall. A few minutes later my teacher said that they were getting ready to watch the news in the next room and that we should all go in and see it. Still in my mind the story was just some ordeal over a small plane crash or a flight controller's major screw up. This was not a big deal.We turned on the TV to my first image of what had happened. It was somewhere around 8:15 in the morning in Oklahoma. 8:15 in Oklahoma is 9:15 in New York City and Washington, and the second tower had just been hit only a few minutes before we made our way into the other room. I was still ignorant to the reality before my eyes. As the screen came on I could sense the panic that was now gripping the nation. I was still of the belief that this was all just a matter of error. I was shocked that a second plane could hit the very next building. I kept my belief that it must have all been some huge mistake. I wondered how a control tower could ever make such a huge mistake. Several minutes past as I just kept thinking over and over to myself how someone could make a mistake that bad. How could planes that big get put so far off course? How could they hit the buildings so... perfectly?Then someone on the TV said that word. They said that word which would define the world for the next decade. They said a word which would create a rift between cultures and birthed hatred in hearts of millions. From the moment after it was said, my life and my existence, my place in this world would change forever.Terrorism.This is the mind of a 15 year old when the world was a better place. The only options my happy peaceful creativity could create was a reality where the only times that horrible things happen are when something breaks, accidents happen, or someone messes up. My mind only really thought about the politics of high school, getting to drive next year and Traci Lott in her cheerleading uniform. The idea that someone would want to hurt that many people wasn't real to me. I doubt in all honesty that such a reality was very real to very many other people as well. Incidents like the bombing of the USS Cole on 12 October 2000 were small and isolated. A crazy person probably did that. A few sailors died and that was sad, but this was just a freak thing that doesn't happen all that much. It isn't going to sink very far into the attention of a 15 year old. Terrorism wasn't a real thing, just a movie plot. Do you think that any of us really took terrorist seriously before that? Our cultural memory doesn't go back far enough to ever understand the importance of words like ""terrorism."" To many, terrorists were one shot crazy people. They were madmen and anarchists hopped up on conspiracy theories and ideals of a survivalist utopia. They were hippy tree huggers who would blow up a logging facility because of forests or something. In the worst case they were Ted Kazinkskis, the Timothy McVeighs and the Terry Nichols. They were lone gunmen in a mall. They were drug dealers. They were the people who wanted to get somebody out of prison so they would take a bunch of hostages, demand the release of their leader, $1,000,000 and a getaway vehicle. They might even hijack a plane to do it. They robbed banks and such. But these weren't real people, just characters. We had no emotional connection to this idea.It wasn't that this was the first major incident of terrorism in the world. In Northern Ireland the IRA had been fought for years. The Balkans were still a fresh memory, but really that was it. We had forgotten about the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut and even the bombing of the Trade Center years before. At best we could remember the Oklahoma City bombing, especially where I grew up. That was the largest act of terror in world history up to 9/11 and it trained us on what to think terrorism meant. As I said before, terrorists are crazy people. They don't have a real plan, just a bomb. They wanted to make a statement, but none before were ready to make a war. This was the existential dilemma I and 300,000,000 million people were about to face.Watching the images on the screen I sat in bewilderment. The buildings billowed with heavy smoke and ash as the heat from the planes continued to build. The question of terrorists seemed too impossible to believe when it happened.At 8:40 am central time, another plane hit the Pentagon............""Oh my God...""""We're at war.""When we heard the news of the third crash I felt a sense of shock. This was an undeniable happening now. I understood enough to know what the Pentagon was. I knew it was the headquarters of our military. I knew that it was the nerve center and where the most important decisions were made. Someone trying to attack us would want to attack that building. They would want to bring down our leadership and our ability to fight them back. This was real. This was intentional. It was planned with a purpose. Someone had orchestrated something violent and terrible. Someone had intentionally set themselves on a path to bring down the United States. Someone had declared war on us.I didn't understand anything that was going on. For the next hour or so all I could think of was ‘Why?’. In the eyes of a 15 year old child “How could anyone hate the Americans?” I didn't understand world politics. I didn't understand religions other than my own. I didn't know the history of American involvement in the rest of the world. And even if I did, what on Earth could justify this? I couldn't fathom why someone would want to go so far to attack us... quite literally out of the clear blue sky. It was a numb confusion and fear until we went to the library.We left the art room far after we should have been in our next class. This was far more important than anything we had going on that day and the teachers knew it. We didn't spend long in the next class either. I honestly don't remember what class it was, but we all left to go to the library with the rest of the other sophomores to watch what was going on.There in that room my class was gathered in a large semicircle watching a screen 24 inches wide with images that would be burned into our minds forever. In that room was gathered every other sophomore at my school. There were 54 of us in that room. There with me then were people I had known my entire life. Those boys are in a baby picture with me where the four of us are all in the same crib. That guy has played football with me for the last 4 years. That girl was my first kiss in the second grade. That boy was my best friend and that girl over there will one day be my wife. These were my friends and my enemies. They were my rivals and peers. It's hard to explain the bond of a group so small who has known each other so long, but that day it meant something - because in the next few moments, we were going to need each other.As we entered the library they told us that another plane had crashed, this time in a field somewhere. Dan Rather was now heading the news effort. He was the voice of the events for the rest of that day. The news was focused on New York. The buildings were still on fire, but rescue workers were there. It had been a while now since the attacks began. The rest of the country had all other flights grounded. Perhaps this was it. Perhaps we were safe. I think that that was when it hit me... I might not be safe. I know this sounds spoiled to say, but I have never known the feeling of unsafe. I am an American. I live between two oceans in the heart of my country. Between me and those who would do me harm were hundreds of the mightiest ships on Earth, thousands of missiles and hundreds of thousands of the strongest, bravest, scariest men and women to protect me from what lied beyond. I never knew what it was like for children in places like Bosnia and Rwanda, Darfur and Cambodia. I didn't know what it was like to experience a sleepless night fearful of the shadows beyond my window, because I was an American. I didn't know what it was like for children in war torn villages or the survivors of tragedies of the human condition, because I was an American. Fear, true fear, was still one of those myths that came from the TV. That's not to say that I understand such fear now, but that was the day that the idea of real fear was given to us. That was the day that fear became a part of the American way of life. That was the day that there were people out there that wanted to kill us. Not just our government, not just our President and not just our warriors. There were people out there who wanted to killThe morning drew on. Words like Islam, Al-Qaeda and Taliban began to enter our vocabulary. Religious zealots and sleeper cells were unreal to us. None of this could be real. And yet it was. The fires continued. Rescue workers continued to arrive. I knew it was only a matter of time until they would get the fires under control and everything would be fine. Then a man jumped from a high window. The fires had trapped him and in desperation he fled and fell to his demise. I remember thinking, “If he only waited they could have rescued him.” Perhaps in hindsight, it was better for him the way he died. What in my mind seemed like moments later, a small cloud of dust began to form. That cloud grew as it flowed downward. As the shadow of a great roaring behemoth it grew with exponential force as it tore the building apart. Collapsed. I remember looking on in disbelief that a building such as one of the twin towers could fall. Video shots were coming in from all over the city. From the ground a news person caught the monster as it spilled out into the streets. Terrified New Yorkers fled in every direction to escape the beast's wrath. I remember one image of a man, dazed and confused, staggering through the cloud of ash and dust, coated in a heavy layer of pale powder. The dust began to settle and men began to rush into the storm. Police and firefighters layered in ash and dust ran into the shadow to save whoever might be left.The dust left a trail as the building fell. A strange outline in the same shape and encompassing the same volume where the building once stood lingered as if a ghost of the building itself. It remained for a few moments as if it were a shadow of the mighty building that once existed in that place, now making it's exit from history, taking with it the souls of thousands of innocent Americans. Still desperately naive I prayed that all the people got out. They must have, this is a good world and things like this don't happen. All eyes were now on the second tower. News reports continued to flow as we waited and hoped that the inevitable wouldn't come to pass. And then, as its sister before, it too laid down in the roar of ash and death.When the towers crumbled it was both a literal and figurative breaking point for us as Americans. Our reality was now fully broken and all of our previous assumptions about the outside world were dashed. Girls in the room were crying. Boys held clinched fists and swore flaccid oaths of revenge. The majority of us just stood and watched in awe as the shadow rose over the country with the noonday sun.Throughout the rest of the day I remember almost nothing else but the news. At some point after classes that meant nothing, I had football practice. I remember that only because it was the only normal thing that day. We did sprints. We practiced plays. We didn't talk about it. There we just carried on. Eventually I returned home and watched the news. It was nothing but the same. An angle was discovered that showed the second plane hitting, then another, and another. The collapse was shown from every possible vantage point. Estimates of the dead reached the thousands. We all existed in a surreal state for the rest of that day. More words continued to seep into our minds. ""Fanatical"", ""Jihad"", ""Afghanistan"" and Osama Bin Laden. Our shock and awe began to give way to anger and hate as the rift that would one day become the culture chasm that exists between Islam and the American West today. We understood nothing of that other religion on the other side of sea. We imagined they were happy with their lives as were happy with ours and that we all were happy just being left alone. Now a person stands up and speaks with authority that he represents Islam and that America is the enemy. This man and his Al Qaeda were the enemy and they were to be hated. We were young then. We did not know what the difference between Al Qaeda and Islam were. How would we? All we knew is what he told us about why he killed those people, and now we had a direction to point our hate. If we only knew what the future would bring and how the events of one day would change two great civilizations and the fate of the world forever.As the night went on I thought about the survivors in the rubble. Images of thousands of workers climbing on piles of what once were the most prominent parts of the New York City skyline were now part of the newscast. I thought about what they had all gone through and what it would mean from here on out. Of course I didn't understand any of it. At that time finding Afghanistan on a map would have been just as impossible for me as stopping the planes with my bare hands. I barely knew the differences between my church and the church down on the street, let alone the theological divide between ours and the second largest religion in the world. I didn't understand politics and didn't know where what would lead. All I knew I saw in the images and voices from the news that day.One thing I do remember before I went to bed that day was Dan Rather signing off for the night. He manned his post deep into the evening reporting everything that had transpired throughout the day. As the day drew on you could see the weight of it on his face. His tie was now loose and his hair began to look unkempt. His eyes spoke of a deep and weary woe. I felt sorry for him. All day I had watched this man pour over every detail of the day and communicate them to me and every other American on what would be the most important day of our cultural identity since Pearl Harbor more than half a century before. And that's when I realized what he had been through. His job was to be obsessed with this tragedy since the moment it happened. Every heart-breaking moment, every death and every detail was his responsibility to tell. He more than almost any other American knew what had taken place from the moment the planes were hijacked, the crashes, the collapses, the rescue efforts and what the government was planning to do about it. All of it passed through his eyes and out of his lips to reach the rest of us. You could see the pain and fatigue of the entire country on his face. Still, he was there. His job was to deliver what news there was to us. He had to maintain that stoic demeanor and concrete professionalism to be a reassuring pillar to all of us. He came from a background where he believed in no nonsense news, void of the hype and entertainment that plagues our information media today. He had even gone to Afghanistan and met the Mujahideen forces related to what would one day become the Taliban. He even sat across from Saddam Hussein in an interview. I found out later that Dan Rather was even once a Marine in the United States military. He understood duty and service. In this moment he did a great service. I think sometimes that there are a few great people who live there entire lives for a single moment in history. On America’s most terrible day, I remember one news caster who seemed to have been prepared his whole life, to be the calm and reassuring voice that helped maintain light in our darkest hour. As a personal note I took a lesson that day. I understood the importance that media professionals have. They communicate what is going on to the world and shape the way the rest of us views it. I think about how the things I say may affect those who read it. I truly think that I write the way I do because of what I saw in him that day. I believe in no nonsense when it comes to the pressing issues of the day. I believe that there are things that must be said and that those who can should say them. I believe that those who present the facts must do as much as they can to avoid their own biases when presenting the truth to allow the viewer to come to a clear decision. People in the media have a responsibility to be fair, to be thorough and be professional, something I fear all too much all but died over the last few years and decades. I believe these things because that is what I saw in Dan Rather that day and while his act isn't a moment that stands out to many, he actually was one of my personal heroes of 9/11.How did it change you if at all?After 9/11 I began to look outside more often. I was no longer content with the average life and the average story that was going on outside the plains and fields of a small town in Oklahoma. I wanted to know and understand the world and what brought us to this point. My focus drifted to what was going on overseas and in the war. I still understood very little. I knew that I wasn't content to just go to college like my other classmates, but wanted more. I wanted to understand the world and maybe do my part to fix it. I felt, as many did, that 9/11 was an attack not only on a few buildings and several thousand people, but of our way of life. I felt personally targeted because of my way of life and my fellow people. I wanted to prevent this type of action from happening again and do something about it in the future so that maybe one day my children would not have any days like this seared into their memory. A few years later I joined the United States Marine Corps. After this I was deployed to the Middle East twice in 2005 and 2007. I learned a great deal about the real heart of the matter, about why we are over there, what our motivations are and those of our enemy. I understand a lot more today than I did that morning and have grown much from my experiences. I'm glad I did my part, but wish I had the power to have been able to do more. Now I am out and still spend a great deal of time and focus in the Middle East and understanding about the evolution of the war that has lasted for more than a decade. I write a great deal about it, my experiences and what I think others should know when it comes to understanding how all of it comes together. I try to do this fairly so that others may learn and understand as I have, but I don't always live up the model I have made in Mr. Rather. Still, 9/11 set me on a path that I do not regret and would probably relive if given the chance. 9/11 had an effect on all of us. While our individual reaction to it it may not have been that important, it changed us. We all grew a little and started looking outside our shell of invulnerability a lot more. For some it was more important than others. For me I can say this, while it may have been just an important day for many, it was intricately tied to the events that would shape the rest of my life.Relaxed. Researched.

I also think that the attacks on September 11th 2001 were heinous terrorist actions.Ok. Are we good?I was in a college dorm in Iowa hanging out with a group of friends. Two of them were Australians, one a New Zealander, and three were Americans. All of a sudden I heard a shout from one of my American friends yelling that America was under attack. We all went into his room since he had a television and we watched the fiery buildings. The Americans were shocked and baffled and could not move their eyes from the screen. The Aussies and Kiwi (myself included) watched for a couple of minutes and then got bored. We went back to my room and hung out playing guitar and chilling out. A few hours later we realized that this was a really big deal to the Americans. They were all in utter shock and couldn’t understand why this would have happened.By the time night had fallen I’d had several hushed conversations with my various foreign friends and the theme was the same every time. We all agreed that the attacks were horrible but we had all been expecting something like 9/11 to happen for years. It wasn’t a surprise to us at all. We had to walk a fine line when we were talking to Americans because they had no idea how incredibly unpopular America had become abroad nor had they heard about any negative action that America had ever taken in other countries. They didn’t know about America arming the mujahadin in Afghanistan. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_III ] They didn’t know about the USA’s bombing of the Al Shaifa pharmaceutical plant. They didn’t know about the USS Vincennes shooting down a passenger plane and killing 290 civilians. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655 ]In short they had no idea why anyone would have hated America enough to want to attack it. Even in my home country of Australia -a staunch US ally- there was a lot of anger towards America due to its alleged involvement in deposing a popular, democratically elected leader.To all of us foreign students 9/11 seemed like the most obvious thing that could have happened. Now again I want to reiterate that the 9/11 attacks were heinous crimes against humanity. It’s just that to me and all of my friends they were completely unsurprising and completely expected.— — —Edit: please read before commenting.This answer is blowing up and people are misunderstanding what I’m saying. I have no ill-will towards America nor did I in 2001. I’m certainly not saying that America deserved it or “had it coming.” My wife, my children, and my father are American. I love America.

I had an 8 AM meeting of the NYU School of Medicine Graduate Medical Education Committee, so to be sure I would be on time to the meeting I drove in from my home outside Princeton instead of my more usual commute by train. It was a good drive, no traffic issues, I got through the Holland Tunnel, turned south on West Street, and drove around the bottom of Manhattan, passing the Trade Center towers as usual. I got to the parking lot between NYU and Bellevue Hospital, parked, and walked into the medical school. The meetingSeptember 11, 2001 was a bright sunny morning in New York and New Jersey. I had an 8 AM meeting of the NYU School of Medicine Graduate Medical Education Committee, so to be sure I would be on time to the meeting I drove in from my home outside Princeton instead of my more usual commute by train. It was a good drive, no traffic issues, I got through the Holland Tunnel, turned south on West Street, and drove around the bottom of Manhattan, passing the Trade Center towers as usual. I got to the parking lot between NYU and Bellevue Hospital, parked, and walked into the medical school. The meeting was on the 15th floor with large windows facing south down First Avenue. At some point during the meeting I noticed a lot of smoke in the sky to the south, and looked out to see that one of the WTC towers was on fire…about 2/3 of the way up the building. I remarked on this to my colleagues, and we noted that a fire that big in a very tall building like that was likely a major event and we might expect some casualties.The meeting ended, I walked down the 5 blocks to my office in Bellevue. My laboratory’s staff was in and had pulled an old television out of a closet and plugged it in to one of the local news station. By that time the second plane had hit, and it was quite clear this was a deliberate terrorist attack. We soon got notified that all elective surgery was canceled to make available all of the ORs for possible casualties. We went about our daily tasks of examining slides from the previous day’s neurosurgical operations. I tried to call my wife but the call would not go through.Then one of my technologists told me a plane had hit the Pentagon. One of my brothers worked there; the other worked for Condi Rice in the White House. I tried reaching each of them with no luck. I was able to get an e-mail to my wife, and she told me she had talked with my parents who had heard that my brothers were OK but were unable to talk, obviously there was a lot going on.TV reception (no cable, this was broadcast TV) was terrible as, of course, the broadcast tower was up on the top of one of the WTC buildings. Nevertheless, we could see the coverage as the buildings burned, and then was astonished to see one collapse. The collapse of the second was not a surprise after that.After signing out all my cases with my residents and students, i attended to all sorts of other work. I kept up on the news, which was full of rumors…the US Air Force had shot down other airliners, there were other crashes, there were bomb threats against the George Washington Bridge, etc. The police had, in fact, closed down the bridges, tunnels, and rail lines leaving Manhattan. I could not have left the city if I had wished to.At some point I was able to talk to my wife. She was worried but I assured her nothing was going on at our hospitals; in fact, we had seen zero patients from the WTC (and would see none). Around 5 PM the radio I had no carried news that the police had opened up the George Washington bridge, so I closed up my computer and got to my car. I turned on the radio to monitor the news and started to fight the traffic up First Avenue to head north to the bridge. In a few minutes I heard on the radio that they had opened up the Lincoln Tunnel, and I was still south of the entrances to it, so I diverted, got over to the west side earlier than I had planned to get to the bridge, and joined the traffic heading to the tunnel. It was slow-moving. There was a young woman standing at a corner with a sign asking to get to New Jersey, so I rolled down the electric window on the passenger side and asked where she needed to go. She said if I could just get her through the tunnel it would be fine, someone could pick her up. So I unlocked the door and let her in. We rolled slowly to the tunnel and then went faster once in it. I took one of the first exits to drop her off, and then made my way to the NJ Turnpike going south. Just to the left of due south were the pillars of smoke marking the fires still burning where the towers had collapsed. Some people were pulled off the road on to the shoulder, watching. I just kept driving and got home only slightly late for dinner.That was my 9/11.",0 followers,Peter,2K,43.6K,166.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-hate-technology
