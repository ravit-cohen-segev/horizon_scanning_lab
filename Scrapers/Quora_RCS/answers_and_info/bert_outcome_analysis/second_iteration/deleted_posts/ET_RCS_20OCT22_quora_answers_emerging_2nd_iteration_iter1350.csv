There are so many success stories about people who chose this field and are now are on top of their game, that it’s unnecessary to give examples.Even so, you may not be sure whether Computer Science should actually be your stream of choice. This article aims to help you with that.Let’s start with the end. What will you actually do after graduating in Computer Science? Gone are those days when it was just about fixing computers or laptops. There are infinite options, but here are aComputer Science is actually a part of nearly everything nowadays! Ever thought of biotechnology, nanotechnology or robotics? A degree in computing could lead to any one of these fields too.Next, what makes it aWhat will you get learn? I am a CSE student and based on the experience I can tell you that you will get to learn different languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, PHP, Data Sciences etc. Along with this, you get to explore systems, initially starting with the normal PCs that you operate. Also when working with computing technology it is very important to follow a certain flow o the procedure for the system you are working on. This is an important subject, on algorithm and protocols.What should you focus on during your course? I personally think that you should know at least 2 languages thoroughly. My suggestion would be to start with C/C++ and go through all its basics. After that, you move on to learn about Java which is a trending language for application based tools. These will be helpful for you to fetch a job and most MNCs ask questions from these languages.I thought the best part about studying computer science is that it’s practical. At least for me, it was. You won’t just learn the theoretical part (like an atom in chemistry or waves in physics) but also get the opportunity to apply things when you do them practically.Finally, the most important takeaway that I want my juniors to know - Opt for this branch only if you want to become a real-life problem solver because that is the crux.Careers• Software Developers :• Hardware Engineers :• System Designer :• System Analyst :• Networking Engineers :• DBA :Now another question, which comes with it, which university or college to choose for CSE.There are many universities that offer this course, you would always be starting up with IIT and NIT. Still I would say there are many private universities that offer much better education and facilities than IIT and NIT.One of such university is Lovely Professional University. If we talk about engineering, the only point that strikes our mind is practical learning. LPU offers the perfect blend of theoretical and practical learning, that makes their student stand high in the corporate world.You get Experienced and talented faculties, well equipped labs, great infrastructure that even beats IIT’s and NIT’s .Students are given hands on training, certifications from Google SAP , Oracle, internship and complete placement assistance.Recently one of the LPU Student has bagged a placement of worth Rs 42 Lakh at Microsoft.Few of the major outcomes of this course at LPU are :I hope this helps.All the best!",0 followers,Benoît Seron,3.1K,223,2.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-study-CSE

Can you find inaccuracies in the text? )• Use a highlighter (still quite a passive practice though, it’s better to write)• Teach others• Take notes as you read• If you are not having difficulties, then you are learning inefficie1. Be active• Take responsibility for your own learning• Process the material by doing summaries, or paraphrasing or even explaining in a simpler language (in contrast to just copying the class)• Read 20 minutes of class, then try to give its main points out of memory, with your course closed• Make challenges out of boring classes (e.g. how fast can you do one chapter? Can you find inaccuracies in the text? )• Use a highlighter (still quite a passive practice though, it’s better to write)• Teach others• Take notes as you read• If you are not having difficulties, then you are learning inefficiently. Increase the cognitive strain.2. Study regularly• Memory works best when the material is repeatedly studied, over increasingly distant periods of time.• Ideally, a single piece of information should be repeated over the following intervals: After 20 minutes, a day, a week, a month, two months• Study at least six days a week• It's better to study 10 times one hour, than 10 hours straight.3. Go to class• Take notes, constantly• Write continuously to stay focused, as well as to learn to write fast for tests• Pledge to make your notes public so they have to be of high quality. Do the same for your summaries, and announce them before you do them, so you have peer pressure to set yourself at work• Start focusing 5 minutes before the class begins, by trying to summarize the last class in your head, or better still, to the guy sitting beside you• Don't read class notes before class (otherwise you will be bored, get passive and waste your time)4. Work hard, rest hard• Predefine your work and rest periods• Break down your work into two-hour blocs with large breaks (about half an hour) in between.• Each bloc should be divided into 25 minutes of work, with 5-minute rest periods• Use a (physical) timer to limit your pauses• On a break, go outside, open the windows, socialize, clean up - don't go on your phone and avoid watching videos• Allow for some quality 'me-time' in advance, and write it down ahead, so you work with it in mind• Pay attention to having a stable and restful sleep, from 22h to 6h, every single day• Work in the morning with a two-hour block before classes start• Keep a positive mindset towards the class• Plan your day according to your typical energy levels (e.g. high in the morning, low at 14h,...)•Separate between work that requires focus or not5. Use memory techniques (if required - I never had to)• If you don't want to study, it's not going to work - you need to have an interest and motivation• Make sense of the material• Make visual associations in your mind• If you have lots of by heart material to study, learn from advanced memory techniques books - it's the best time investment possible if you study medical school or biology for instance6. Plan your study• Plan each day the night before, limiting yourself to six objectives (Ivy Lee)• Don't plan hour by hour unless you're at an advanced level - if you don't keep up with your schedules, then they are pointless• Take yesterday's 6 objectives, and start with the first one up until completion, and don't touch the others. Go to the next one. Repeat.• Study what you like first, then what's hard, then what's easy, then what's boring7. Set up a clinical work environment• Set aside part of a room, or even a full room, dedicated for study• Make it agreeable and personal with posters and photographs• Everything should be clean• Your desktop should be totally empty, except for a lamp and the current material in use• Hide your computer and phone in another room. Put your phone on silent. If possible, give them to someone while you study.• Lighting should be intense, and fairly cold (5000K or more) during the day. It should be dimmed hours prior to sleep.• Eliminate any other distraction such as music, noise, pets, people. Known lyric-less music can be used to cover up noise.8. Study from general to particular• Scan the class a handful of times, each time slower, so you know what we talk about and what matters before you study. (It helps to avoid getting stalled).• Look at the objectives of each section: what are they trying to do/answer? (It helps in being proactive).• Method SQ3R (if needed):• Method THIEVES (if needed):9. Eat healthily• Eat five times a day• Do have breakfast• Eat a low-carb, high-protein diet (carbs will crash out your focus and make you hungry all the time)• Cook by yourself• Discard anything that your great grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food• Drink alcohol only for parties, even if in small amounts (no casual beers)10. Prepare for tests11. Enforce good behavioursEDIT : Wow, nearly 15k views and 150 upvotes ! Thanks a lot guys. I wrote this as the first chapter of my book, thinking that nobody would even read it.

Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a bicep curl like movement to lift something?The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and stamina so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life.Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns.By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape would do (That, in a nutshell, is my answer to this question.I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not compliant robots.",0 followers,Rabiya Memon,10.5K,292,7.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-study-CSE

5,"Today, there are too many people who don't like to study. I think this problem can be credited for two reasons. Firstly, I think that we must admit that studying is a boring process compared with other activities such as playing video games or watching a movie. Moreover, I also believe that many people don't like to study because they don't know how to study.First, whether you admit it or not, the truth is that learning is a very tough process, because you need to spend a lot of energy on doing that thing. For example, when you're playing a video game, it doesn't matter whether you win or not.Today, there are too many people who don't like to study. I think this problem can be credited for two reasons. Firstly, I think that we must admit that studying is a boring process compared with other activities such as playing video games or watching a movie. Moreover, I also believe that many people don't like to study because they don't know how to study.First, whether you admit it or not, the truth is that learning is a very tough process, because you need to spend a lot of energy on doing that thing. For example, when you're playing a video game, it doesn't matter whether you win or not. If you can win, you will be very happy. If you don't, it is also not a big deal. However, when you are studying, things will be very different. Unless you can find some pleasure in studying, studying is just an approach to getting a satisfactory salary or a satisfactory degree. Once you have a clear goal, then you will pay a lot of energy for those things, which will make studying become a laborious thing. So from this point of view, studying is an energy consuming thing, and that can explain why many people don't like it.However, the aforementioned reason is only a surface-level reason, and the underlying reason is that many people don't know how to study effectively. More precisely, many people concentrate on learning knowledge by consuming a lot of time to attend some classes or read a lot of books. But they don't know what is the most critical point of studying. In fact, the target of study is not to get a satisfactory salary or get an enviable degree. When you have this idea, studying will absolutely become an agony thing. As a matter of fact, I believe that the target of studying is to tackle a real world problem. I don't encourage studying useless things. More specifically, if you want to learn machine learning, you do not need to find a famous book and read it from the first page to the last page. You just need to find a real world problem and try to solve it. If you don't have any ideas to tackle it, you can just ask other people or search for a solution by search engine. By doing so, I believe that you can quickly master how to use machine learning tools in the real world, and grasp critical concepts in a short time.In conclusion, I believe that many people don't like to study because they don't find the magic code of study. They just follow the guidance of teachers and don't want to really use their knowledge in the real world. So they often feel that studying is a boring process. However, once you don't view it as a necessary thing and concentrate on solving the problems, you will find that studying is no longer a boring process. Just concentrate on solving problems rather than studying. I believe that you will suddenly find you have learned a lot of useful knowledge inadvertently in one day.",0 followers,Tamara M,7K,101,14.1M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-study-CSE

In other words, people who are not taught to analyze or draw conclusions from history areJust look at this Instagram influencer who managed to convince her fan base that women stopped wearing corsets because of the male patriarchy.She claims that the male patriarchy during the Victorian Era advocated against corsets by claiming it was dangerous for women’s health. She states that corsets were beneficial for woman, citing its use for many centuries as proof.Although it’s true that corsets have advantages, such as helping straighten the back, it’s absolutely ridiculous to claim that the male patriarchy spread the myth that corsets are “torture devices” and this resulted in modern-day woman not wearing corsets.The worst part is that people in the comment section genuinely believe this to be true!This is how I responded.History proves her claim as absurd. As someone who is an avid reader of history, I assumed most people would know that woman stopped wearing corsets by the turn of the 20th century due to negative attitudes and the emergence of the flapper movement that heavily criticized the oppressive garment. During that period of history, woman craved freedom of movement in their clothing.The impracticality and restrictiveness of the corset as well as the social and cultural changes sparked a women’s fashion revolution.It is scary to think how easy it was for her followers to buy into the “male patriarchy” theory despite no evidence backing her claim.This is why history is so important! History provides us with a better understanding of how our society is shaped and the significance of past events on our moral values, judgment and decision-making. History allows us to think deeply on issues of war, race, poverty, inequality or humanity.History is important, and it’s more than just a textbook from school. History is a treasure trove of valuable discovery, information and resources.That’s why it is vital to study history outside of the school curriculum. Don’t just learn about your country’s history but explore different time periods and major historical events from around the world.

You begin by looking for entry-level and junior positions; evenEarly February is when Red River College puts on itsBeginning a new career can be an intimidating and frustrating endeavor. You begin by looking for entry-level and junior positions; evenHow are you supposed to have experience when you’re just starting your career? How will you prove you have the skills necessary? What differentiates you from the next candidate?Another challenge is the fact that no one knows who they are. A lot of technology jobs aren’t advertised online but are spread via WOM (word of mouth). Unfortunately, meeting new people outside of school can be extremely difficult if you aren’t sure where to start.I spoke with a few friends from my Twitterverse community to see what they had to say on the topic:“The biggest challenge I’ve had when starting out is comparing myself to those that have been around much longer. It always led to a mental uphill battle when it came to learning, and I felt like I was absolutely terrible at my job. It seems insurmountable, but staying curious and taking things one at a time helped me to get where I am today.” –Starting out can be challenging and scary. It’s hard to see others so far along and to not get lost in trying to translate how they got from point A to point B. You may not be 100% confident in your abilities yet, and you might not really know how to learn more.This brings me to another very common challenge (especially among professional women) in the IT and other fields: dealing with “Imposter Syndrome.”One of my close friends,Imposter Syndrome is not actually based on your abilities, it can affect anyone from those starting out to those who are better established.“Imposter Syndrome is best described as a feeling of deep inadequacy with your current level of skill; as though you just don’t measure up to your peers. Sometimes, it’s punctuated with a feeling of inadequacy, other times it may be punctuated with a feeling of listlessness; ‘What’s the point if everyone is better at this than me?'”You’ll see your peers doing awesome things and sharing their knowledge, and you’ll think, “I didn’t know /any/ of that. Am I really fit to be here?”Y’see, the thing about infosec, IT or any particular career in general is that there are so many different areas of specialization that being a master in every aspect is impossible. If you’re a jack of all trades, you are certainly a master of none.You aren’t as inadequate as you think; you just see others’ focus/talent down one particular specialization and assume that they know everything there is to know about a subject, that their knowledge dwarfs yours and that you’ll never be their equal. But that’s just not so.The reality is that each of us has a particular specialization in our fields that we gravitate towards, and it is only through sharing knowledge (blogs, white papers, articles, conference talks, etc.) that the entire picture is unveiled.Take me, for instance. My specialization is rule-based IDS/IPS (Snort), with some skill in other NSM functionality (flow monitoring, full packet capture, and anomaly monitoring like BRO). I also have some modicum of skill when it comes to malware analysis tools and mining Open-Source threat intelligence.I don’t know the first thing about appsec (my programming skill is rudimentary at best), I know next to nothing about reverse engineering (trying and improving on this), and while I understand the concepts of penetration testing and adversary emulation, I’ve never held a position as a penetration tester in my life.But I go to conferences, I read articles/blogs/tutorials and I engage others in the community. I learn through their experiences in their specializations, and I make myself a little more well-rounded as a result.“If you’re suffering from Imposter Syndrome, I just want to tell you that you aren’t as clueless as you seem. Even if you’re new to Infosec, there is likely some view or some perspective you bring that makes the knowledge that you share unique. Take your time, find your niche, and share your knowledge with the world.” –Although going to school isn’t the only option, I know for me it was a huge part of forming who I am today. Even so, I still have my struggles. I continually deal with Imposter Syndrome. I feel great one second, but then the next, I feel like I’m faking it. Especially when I’m reaching further and trying more challenging things. It is extremely beneficial to challenge yourself, but it can be hard on your confidence when you fail. And you will. Any time you’re in a job that comes easily, for me, it’s time to move on.When I was working at Lazer Grant LLP, the accounting firm I started out with, I realized I enjoyed the IT department but felt like there was so much I was missing to be able to move forward. I chose to go back to school and in January 2013, I entered the Business Information Technology program at Red River College.This program looked at many different parts of Information Technology, including programming, web development, Cisco networking academy, system administration, communications, basic accounting, network management, database management, entrepreneurship, and more.It gave me a solid foundation of knowledge that I now can use to continue learning. Additionally, there is that little paper that proved, to me, I knew what I was talking about.Working in the professional atmosphere doesn’t always mean you instantly get along with everyone, the ‘soft skills’ rarely come naturally, especially in this sort of field.Jimmy Vo ([ How to Win Friends and Influence Hackers by Jimmy Vo, BSides Asheville 2014 ]One thing you should note is this: who are you in that scale? I recently purchased a book called[ How to Win Friends and Influence Hackers by Jimmy Vo, BSides Asheville 2014 ]This includes knowing your ‘personality’ type. Take note that this can and does change. Before college, I was highly introverted, but during college, I scored much higher on the extrovert side. Now a year after I’ve graduated, I’m more in the middle. The most recent test I’ve taken gave me INTP. I know that I can be very logical in my thought process, but I know I lack emotional understanding now and then, which just means I should take extra notice on that.Another member who is starting their journey into the InfoSec community makes his point on what making a mark really means to him:“Making my mark in IT and more specifically Information Security has proven incredibly tough, and I still have not reached the point where I feel I have made my mark. However, ongoing projects, ideas, and collaborations with people from the InfoSec community has been pushing me further. Making your mark also depends on how you specifically want to impact IT, and I believe that people have different milestones in mind for when they consider their mark made. Some people may want to be well recognized and popular in the IT community; others may just want to release a tool they have in mind; still others may just want to reach a point of where they can then start teaching newcomers in the IT community. All of these are great ways to engrave your presence in the IT community. Personally, I conducted a lot of research into malware analysis and started to hunt malware before posting those findings on my Twitter account. Doing this started to get me some attention from the InfoSec community, and I started to build connections, which is exactly what I wanted.“I love the InfoSec community, but making my entry felt rather rough. This is because when you say you work in IT, many people assume you know everything instantly. When you run into an issue you might ask for help and receive the ‘you don’t know that?’ response, or you are in fear of that response and therefore don’t want to ask. Obviously this is an issue.“We work in information security, so our end goal is to work together to design new technologies, processes, and methodologies that will ensure the safety of our data. We are here to beat ‘cybercrime,’ so we really need the entire information security community to band together. As our end goals are similar, I would say creating more of a community is what will really set us up for success. Whether you are just starting out or are a veteran of InfoSec, I believe that each of us needs to work hard to collaborate to make a difference in the world.“Just to restate; you are never really finished learning and pursuing new things. Work hard at your goals but remember it isn’t a simple walk in the park. You can ask for help; we are a community, and you should utilize the contacts you make. Also don’t feel bad about not being in the place you want to be right away. It takes time, and everyone struggles once in awhile. We’re here to help.” –Sev’s commentary above reminded Agnu of another point:“Its super important to never brush off any question, no matter how dumb you may think it is. You don’t know other people’s backgrounds, and that question might fill in a key piece of knowledge that lets a lot of other pieces click into place.”This is a very important thing to note. Think of the phrase “There are no stupid questions.” I do believe there are questions that are not helpful, but when someone is trying to learn, they might not pick up every piece right away.As mentioned above, we all come from different backgrounds but we all learn differently, as well. IPv6 addressing seems logical to me, as do subnetting and summary addressing, but to many techs out there, they honestly do not understand what IPv6 is all about. We want to create a community where others are not scared to ask questions, an environment where when they do ask questions, they can get informative and correct answers.I would like to leave you with some space to think about your ‘personal brand.’ This is the image you are giving out in the world, how others perceive you before you have had the chance to meet. It is extremely important to give off the best image possible and always remember context is not easily seen, especially over text-based conversations.To learn about some of the jobs that await you in IT, particularly in information security, please click",5 followers,Barun Mohanty,3.2K,178,21M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-study-CSE

I would never suggest someone to do BMM as it is one of the worst career options. Maybe initially you won’t realize but after a point, you will regret. It just looks glamorous but it is full of loopholes. Please chose a good career option because that will determine your path ahead and BMM is a Big mistake i made i dont want others to fall in this trap.","18,412 followers",Christopher Reiss,10.6K,3.2K,29M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-study-CSE
