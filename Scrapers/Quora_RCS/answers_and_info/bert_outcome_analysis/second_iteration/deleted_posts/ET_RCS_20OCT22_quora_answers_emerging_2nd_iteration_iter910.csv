Do you really want to have a domain with 4 characters (as mint.com has)? Why not 5 or 6 or 7?Did you do a research to see how much a domain name in related to what you want was sold after market? How much do you actually know about domaining?It seems to me that the owner of that domain got you by the balls (if I may say that). He felt you got in love with it and now is squeezing the last drop from you. Did you negotiate directly, did you tell him upfront who you are and what you wanna do? If you did you you might have just encouraged the owner to ask for more...Who is the owner? Is a known domainer or not well know? A known domainer knows how to negotiate stuff and if you laid down your cards upfront then there is not much you could do. In this case maybe would have been better to get an intermediary to negotiate for you, not disclosing who you are (Facebook did that, for example, when they bought socialgraph.com domain name for a mere $1,300 - guess how much the owner would have asked if he would have known it's Facebook which wanted the domain?)Somebody said to execute and worry about the domain later. Well, partly it's true but you have to think that if you become successful then the domain you want will become much more expensive (case: Facebook itself. It paid $200,000 for facebook.com after it was clear they are becoming successful. Groupon paid $250.000 for groupon.com. By contrast, Twitter paid just $7,000 for Twitter.com, way before they knew or the world knew they will become successful.).You should really look into other possible brands you want to have.Regarding giving equity...I guess that becomes a new trend in this domain world.But it's not always the case when a founder wants to give equity. Sometime ago somebody asked if I give him one domain name I have (I didn't buy that domain name to re-sell but to develop into something). After listening what he wanted to do (which was pretty much in the same field I wanted to develop that name) I asked for equity (not even 15%) or even rental. He denied both and walked away...oh well.In your place I would try to look at other options too...look closer and remember about negotiations (and about falling in love with a domain name).Then, after you got all possible options, decide.As a bonus for you, here are the top 500 domain sales ever: http://www.domaining.com/topsales  (do you think your domain would belong to this list?)","37,874 followers",Ron Rule,516,2.7K,51.5M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-it-for-a-startup-to-buy-a-great-domain-name-for-500-000-given-an-initial-1M-investment-from-an-angel

It’s just a quirk of the story telling of Trek that you’re supposed to look past. If that’s not enough, I supposed there could be THREE answers.ONEEventually, the weak-AI tech gets to a point where with small initiating signals creating a “back and forth” that moves at trillions of times faster than a human brain, the two ship’s comm systems —in seconds— works out the base language. Say, they all shoot a video library at each other, starting with the base numbers, the elements of the universe, the fundamental forces (1/10,000,000th of a second), then they exchange more complex questions (the next ten-millionth of a second), and so on. In a few seconds, they’ve worked everything out.TWOTHREESo while some species in the Beta Quadrant may never have run into the UFP, they likely have run into the Romulans who —in their first handshake connection— transmitted their language library and perhaps several dozen from others (including the “packet” that has hundreds of languages in it). Maybe the Romulans can’t be counted on for that, no problem. It’s likely you’ll run into a dozen other species, one of whom will pass on the “packet” of details (“Here are the 850 languages we’ve encountered + these 86 we have not that are known to lurk out there”). So by the time you’ve run into Star Fleet even if you don’t have a base packet that contains English, you likely have Ferrengi or Xenkethi or Tholian or Shelliak, which can then be used as the “Rosetta stone” to allowing for a quicker communication connection rather than teach the other computer how to speak your language, you use Ferrengi as the first language, then transmit the translations from yours to Ferrengi and vise-versa.","4,203 followers",Joseph Reinemann,594,14.9K,36.9M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-it-for-a-startup-to-buy-a-great-domain-name-for-500-000-given-an-initial-1M-investment-from-an-angel

All throughout the Cold War the USSR has lagged behind the west in most cases regarding aviation technology. Progress basically halted after the collapse of the Soviet Union where there was hardly enough resources to keep the Air Force they had flying at a reduced capacity. It wasn't until around the 2010s that Russia resumed its development of next generation aircraft like the Su-57.While the Su-57 Felon is “stealth"", it isn't of the same quality as the F-22. The F-22 is a fifth generation air superiority fighter and its benefited from the experiences of previous stealth aircraft like the A-12/SR-71And F-117Both of which were also designed by Lockheed.The F-22 is a low observable aircraft with a significantly reduced radar and IR crossection and it remained the only fifth generation fighter for nearly 20 years. Its long been the benchmark for what other designers have aspired to.The Su-57 can kinda be thought of as the next generation of the Flanker family. The Su-27 Flanker was the USSR's high performance fighter from the 1980s and a good aircraft of its day.It was adapted and evolved into several new aircraft due to both its flexible airframe and the aforementioned lack of resources.These essentially are modernized Flankers to update and populate the Russian armed forces but they still share some of the old Su-27's weaknesses. Arguably the greatest of which is its radar cross section. Flankers are not stealthy aircraft. So when the US has had the F-22 for a long while and European fighters like the Rafale and Typhoon have stealth characteristics, its time for another upgrade to keep up. Thats what the Su-57 is meant to be — a stealthy Su-35. But even still its lacking in that department.The Su-57 is Russia's first real attempt at a low observable fighter. And as such its got a lot of development ahead of it. It barely entered service in December of 2020 and only a dozen exist. So even if it was just as advanced as an F-22 it doesn't pose too much of a threat in its curren state.But the fact is, its not as advanced at all. The radar cross section is not uniform. Its most invisible from the front aspect but less so from the sides and rear. Things like the IRST on the nose and control surfaces on the leading edge root extensions compromise that. These features are left over from the Flanker which has always boasted a IRST and supermaneuverability in a close range engagement. Other things like the radar, avionics, and engines, are about as good as Russia can offer at the moment but the sophistication of the weapons and electronic warfare are still lagging behind.We still have a lot to wait and see but its clear that it isn't so much of a rival of the F-22. The Su-57 and even China's new J-20 are not the trailblazers of fifth gen technology.They're still playing catch up to what the F-22 had in the early 2000s and the finish line just got moved up again.",0 followers,Eric Wicklund,1.4K,682,33.1M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-it-for-a-startup-to-buy-a-great-domain-name-for-500-000-given-an-initial-1M-investment-from-an-angel
9,"If the Su-57 had remotely similar technology as the Raptor, then it wouldn’t have so much trouble selling – even among the Russian Air Force. There really is day and night difference between the two, especially when you look beneath the surface.For starters, the APG-77v1 radar on Raptor is at least 15 years ahead of N036/AFAR on Su-57. The APG-77 not only has about 20% bigger aperture (TRMs) but uses a notch antenna compared to Russian AESA radars using a patch (Zhuk-AME) and slotted antenna (N036).Patch or slotted antennas are easier to design and therefore, common among first generation AESAIf the Su-57 had remotely similar technology as the Raptor, then it wouldn’t have so much trouble selling – even among the Russian Air Force.

Notch antennas are difficult to design and are common among second or third generation AESA radars. The biggest difference between the two is in bandwidth – notch antenna offers significantly greater bandwidth which allows the radar to form more complex waveform giving superior LPI characteristics, jamming resistance as well as better resolution and in some cases offensive Electronic Attack (EA) capability.The APG-77v1 on Raptor today uses the same TRMs as F-35’s radar along with the software for Air-Ground modes (SAR mapping, GTMI/T, autonomous target recognition) and EW.Likewise the ALR-94 on Raptor is exponentially more powerful. The ALR-94 and F-35’s ASQ-239 are the only known EW suite on a Fighter that has better than 1° by 1° accuracy against airborne emitters. The Su-57’s L402 will likely have 1° accuracy in azimuth and double-digit in elevation angle against airborne emitters – comparable to the best EW suites on modern 4th gen. platforms but nowhere near F-22. If it were anywhere close to the ALR-94 then the Su-57 wouldn’t have needed the side-mounted radars as the EW suite could have provided comparable performance.Then you’ve Su-57 being the only 5th gen. platform relying on a UV-based Missile Warning System (MWS). Most Fighters in the last 30 years have transitioned to either IR or millimetre-radar based MWS, not only because they offer far better performance at operational altitudes (having 2–4 times greater detection range)Unlike the F-22 which has a highly-directional LPI datalink (IFDL) that allows sharing data among a flight of Raptors without adversely increasing the EM signature, the Su-57 is restricted to conventional datalinks that emit uniformly. The F-22’s IFDL doesn’t just maintain EMCON but is also much more resilient to jamming and offer greater throughput since they’re basically small AESA apertures operating at Q band. All of them together put far superior Situational Awareness in the Raptor’s cockpit, which ultimately makes the difference between being on the firing or receiving end of a gun.Finally, you’ve F-22 being an actual stealth/VLO aircraft. Sukhoi’s own patent which the fanboys try so hard to trash, claims Su-57 having 1,000 to 10,000 times bigger RCS than F-22 (0.1 m^2 vs. -40 dBsm).Where you’ve F-22 and frankly every LO aircraft since F-117 having several inches thick RAM coating on the airframe – the Su-57 has little to no RAM coating on the main airframe. This just highlights the disparity in their Stealth technology and how far behind Russia really is in this area.Many people talk about F-22 using old processors, which is partly true but often misses the context. Some of the early production Raptors used i960MX from 1990s, which was really outdated by the mid-2000s. However, the Central Integrated Processor (CIP) on Raptor still had a computing power of about 10.5 billion instructions per second, each Raptor has 2 CIPs with space for a third.Surprisingly despite using 25 MHz i960MX, Block 10/20 Raptor has twice the computing power of iPhone 6 from 2014 and equivalent to the original Xbox (in terms of Floating point operations).This is because every CIP is made up of 66 SEM-E modules with each module containing two independent processors.All F-22 produced from 2006 (Lot 5) transitioned to Motorola's PowerPC.We don’t have any data regarding Su-57’s computing power; though given 10 years difference between the two, Su-57 may use a more powerful processor but it’s unlikely to be exceeding Raptor’s computing power altogether. For one, there’s a huge gap between US and Russian semiconductor industry, and two, F-22 fleet received an enormous amount of upgrades since the first production aircraft – which indirectly increased the need for computing power. Regardless, the F-22 will be receiving new processors to facilitate transition to an open architecture suite from 2023–24 as part of Raptor’s mid-life update.Not that Su-57 has any need for greater computing power. The F-22’s avionics suite is immensely more powerful and complex. In terms of technology the Su-57 to a large extent only matches the avionics suite of modern Western 4th gen. platforms (Eurocanards, F-15E, Super Hornets, etc.) whom the F-22 has no trouble slaughtering. It’s arguably a serious threat to 4th gen. platforms but merely a target for the F-22 and F-35.","1,110 followers",Jason Wills-Starin,1.5K,1.9K,4.5M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-it-for-a-startup-to-buy-a-great-domain-name-for-500-000-given-an-initial-1M-investment-from-an-angel

Little IR reduction here. And these are traditional engines with no cooling for the exhaust.The Su-57 cannot match the F-22 in any of these categories, and therefore is an inferior product. Considering that the Su-57’s RCS is 0.1m2 to 1m2, similar to a clean F/A-18 Hornet, the Su-57 barely qualifies as a stealth aircraft.All of these differences give the F-22 a tremendous advantage in BVR combat.

The SU-57 has no engine to compete with the F-22, the Izdeliye-30 engine is not set to enter mass production until 2020, even then new reports put the engine won’t be fully ready until 2027 due to ongoing technical issues with the engine and also the SU-57. Costs and finances are another concern with Russia only ordering 12 of the SU-57 instead of 60. Instead 35 SU-35s have been ordered as the SU-57 will not be ready for combat any time soon if at all. The present 9 prototypes and only 12 more built over the next few years is barely enough for training. It will be very difficult to have one operational squadrons with so few planes.It is likely the Russian Air Force has decided the SU-57 is simply to expensive and will just be a technology demonstrator with limited operational use. A test bed for future technologies to be incorporated in a 6th Generation fighter. Perhaps in 15-20 years when 6th Fighters will likely be flying Russia’s financial situation will have improved to allow more modern fighters to be built.Right now, with only 9 prototypes and 12 production models this is not an operational weapon.The F-22 has been in service for over 10 years, the F119 started mass production back in 1996, first successfully tested on the YF-22 in 1991. The engine programme to build and develop the F119 engine commenced in 1983. Russia still now will not have an engine to compete until at least 2020, some 30 years after the F119 was tested on the YF-22. It is similar for China with its WS-15 with ongoing problems hence why it’s production J-20’s has been using the WS-10. Both Russia and China are only now catching up to US engine technology perfected by the US in the late 1980’s, some 30+ years ago. The US is already building and tested engine technologies for the 6th Generation fighter, reports indicate they are well ahead in development so much so that new technologies from the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) are being phased into the F135 engine for the F-35. The 3 stage engines tested with F135 engines as its core as produced fuel efficiency gains of 30% with 10% increase in thrust and 25% in fuel efficiency. These upgrades when put into full production in upgraded F135 engines which is already in planning will significantly boost F-35 range and thrust to power ratio. The aim for a complete new engine for the 6th Generation fighter is for at least 45,000lbs of thrust.

Fighter aircraft like most weapons are offensive in nature, because a powerful offensive capability happens to be the best defence. Besides you might wanna ask the people of Syria, Ukraine and all those small European countries that share their border with Russia about just how defensive Russian military is.The Su-57 doesn’t exist in vacuum, in order to understand its design philosophy you need to look at Russia’s history with stealth aircraft. Right after USAF began the ATF program that resulted in F-22, the Soviets started working on their own stealth Fighter –However, the fall of Russian economy at the time and the aircraft’s huge price tag resulted in Russia cancelling the production of Mig 1.44 long before its first flight. Although the Russian military did realise the importance of stealth aircraft, especially in light of F-117’s success in the Gulf War, and given USAF’s transition towards VLO Fighters with F-22 and F-35 fleet, it became very important for Russia to transition to stealth aircraft.Despite the anti-stealth rhetoric ever since F-117 was publicly revealed, deep down Russian engineers and military leaders knew that they’ll be at a massive disadvantage without stealth aircraft over coming decades but Russia still suffered from limited resources. To not repeat previous failure, the Su-57’s design was heavily based on Su-27/35 family.Instead of creating a new design from scratch, the Su-57 shared the basic airframe of Su-35. This is easily visible from the placement of engines and the fact today Su-57 is using the same AL-41F1 as in Su-35.A radar blocker in the inlet is nowhere as effective as serpentine inlet fully hiding the fan blades. This kind of engine placement is worst for a VLO aircraft as the fan blades are fully exposed from the front. The Su-57’s design didn’t change it because changing the position of engine would have significantly altered the aerodynamics of the aircraft and be nothing short of designing a new aircraft from scratch, which goes against the design goal.The Su-57 is an attempt to have significant RCS-reduction measures on the Flanker design because Russia needed a LO aircraft but lacked the money needed to design a true stealth aircraft from scratch. The best counterpart would be F-18E Super Hornet program or perhaps Boeing’s F-15 Silent Eagle concept; the Su-57 is just a step ahead of the two.Contrary to what some people think, it has nothing to do with Russia giving less emphasis to Stealth or trading Stealth for kinematic performance. The F-22 is arguably as manoeuvrable as Su-57 will be with new engines, if not more and it’s very likely to maintain a notable lead in supersonic regime (acceleration, supercruise). It does all that by having orders of magnitude smaller RCS than Su-57. The notion that Stealth and kinematic performance can’t co-exist is seriously outdated.Also, the idea that VLO aircraft are only useful in SEAD missions is flat wrong. The F-35 routinely eats 4th gen. aircraft running Defensive Counter Air in an Integrated Air Defence system. Neither SAMs or AWACS changes the outcome. It doesn’t matter whether you’re over your home turf or hostile airspace, without stealth you simply don’t stand a chance against 5th gen. platforms.While Su-57 is portrayed as a counterpart to F-22 and F-35, its fundamental design suggest it to be a response to modern 4th gen. platforms (Typhoon, Rafale, F-18E, etc.) which actually increased the gap between Russian and Western 4th gen. aircraft a lot over last 2 decades. The Su-35 isn’t really along the same lines as modern 4th gen. aircraft, especially when it comes to avionics suite and armament. The Su-57 is meant to close that gap and if it lives up to the alleged RCS, it will pose a significant threat to 4th gen. fleet. This is what I believe the designers’ main goal was – to compete with modern 4th gen. platforms, not F-22 or F-35. You can’t be in a fight with VLO aircraft without having the necessary stealth.At the end of the day, Russian military consider stealth more important than most people think because they’re not stupid unlike the fanboys. The reason they suck at it is simply because they don’t have the resources nor the Aerospace industry to overcome the challenges of VLO aircraft, something I explained in another answer.There’s a reason why almost all proposed Fighter programs in Russia today are based on LO platforms (Su-70, Mig-41). It is certainly not because Russia doesn’t consider Stealth useful.",13 followers,John Hanson,1K,2.4K,10.1M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-of-the-alien-cultures-on-Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-have-Skype-FaceTime

Pay careful attention to the dates.The 57’s biggest propogandist/fan here on Quora was a Mr. David Trapp, who dispensed serial fictions attributed to the Su-57, including “ Plasma stealth “ and “Quantum Radar “. Alternately, a GaN based AESA radar - the NIIP O50. Don't bother to Google it, it doesn't exist. It was just a photoshopped number change on a picture of the PAK FA overlayed with sensor locations and ID's. See here :The NO36 AESA radar was - presto ! - suddenly the NO50, with fabricated specs as “ proof”. You can read more about this propoganda fabrication in a link I provide a few paragraphs down.As of 2019, Russia has yet to field an AESA radar in a production fighter plane, although the MiG-35 and Sukhoi 57 are candidates for them.Basically, Mr.Trapp would attempt to disparage the Raptor, then fabricate nonsense ( see Plasma Stealth, Quantum Radar ) while claiming to having definitive insider knowledge of the Raptor's RCS and radar performance. He would use ( without citation ) graphs and charts from an essentially dead and un-updated enthusiast website called Airpower Au as “ proof “ of his specious claims. This is the website. Note the last update date :Air Power Australia - Home PageThen, referencing these charts/graphs, lots of techno-babble, the usual grandiose unprovable claims and purported “ conclusions “ ; an attempt to blind using “ science “ - his take on it. And of course, comments usually disabled after some Koolaid drinking citizens dutifully burped their approval. Critics were usually deleted, and critical rebuttals which slipped into the comment threads were ignored.If you want to read more about the Vaporware NO50 GaN based AESA radar, and “ Plasma Stealth”, you can find Mr. Trapp's musings on these two Unicorns under his answers to these question topics.Which is better, Russian Sukhoi PAK FA T-50 or the US F-22 Raptor? Why?And this answer.Is T-50 as stealthy as F-22 Raptor?Have a look, decide for yourself. Note the T-50 is the prototype designator for the Su-57. It's a 2017 answer.The reality regarding the Su-57 is that no one wants the plane in quantity . Russia has contracted a a limited production run. Mr. Putin proclaimed 76 total through 2028... That's an assertion, not a contract, a major difference. Mr.Putin also proclaimed 2300 T-14 tanks by 2020. Production stopped at a few dozen. Some claim more - perhaps 1-200. I think we'd be hearing all about the “ more “. And, of course, nothing about the “ less “. Changes happen frequently in arms procurement numbers, including the F-22 program.India examined the PAK FA/T-50 prototype planes over some years as a potential buyer, and found it non- competive in many ways as a platform for India's FGFA aircraft project. The plane isn't stealthy enough. The new engines purportedly providing supercruise are not ready. Moving forward, India was counted on to contribute some billions of monies to address the plane's many deficits and receive a production order of aitcraft. India said no to what some thought was a pay to fix deal ; India provides alot of money, and problems/issues get solved, India gets the aircraft they want. Technology transfer was also a sticking point.Meanwhile, the new competition, the F-35 was out there. And the more the F-35 evolved, the harder the propogandists tried to assail it. Including the paid ones. Lots of nonsense, lots of mudslinging, lots of lies. And that was just the Western media. More of the same from Eastern “ media “ outlets and presumably sponsored individual like Mr.Trapp. Understandably, Russia does not want to encounter F-35's, or any VLO aircraft designed with SEAD in mind. Regarding the F-35, here's one reason why :Lockheed filed a patent in 2010 about aEver read an S-400 sponsored individual/fanboy using that public domain patent ? You won't. Ever. Those radar bands cover location to targeting bands. Why would some sponsored individual rhapsodizing about an S-400 bring up a fact when many of them are pitching fictions blended into the marketing puree being offered ?Despite the F-35 smear campaign, the propoganda/marketing claims in support of the PAK/FA - FGFA eventual Su-57 failed too many tests for India to continue investing in it. Ironically, the stealth levels of the F-35 and F-22 were the standards India hoped for with a view towards neighboring Pakistan, and China's emerging 5th Gen stealth efforts.Sukhoi has excellent designers and engineers, but simply lacks the experience and expertise in stealth tech, and the technolgical base and manufacturing capabilities it's American counterparts enjoy. Add AESA radar, computers, sensors, sensor integration, and engines among other disadvantages. R&D costs a great deal of money. The engineers of component suppliers couldn't possibly deliver a competitive product that could match the hype surrounding it, and for many of the same reasons : technology , innovation, expertise, infrastructure, and money.In other words the propoganda and the fiction promoted by the Su-57 4-Ever fan club met reality. No body wants the plane in quantities. It's currently a 5th Gen wannabee, and simply no match for a Raptor currently.Many countries would or wanted to purchase the Raptor. The UK, Australia, and Japan among those countries. It works, as advertised. The Su-57 ? It was advertised and hyped to no end ; it doesn't work yet, as advertised. Follow the money and ignore the hype. Who wants that plane ?No doubt the Sukhoi will eventually evolve into something closer to the propoganda which preceded it. Some or many years from now, a possible export market ? Meanwhile, the F-22 and F-35 will continue to evolve with planned upgrades. And eventually for the F22, a planned successor likely representing the 6th Generation.Edit update, April 4th, 2020 : The first two Su-57's promised for delivery by year's end 2019 were not delivered.

I would spend nearly 3 hours a day on the new thing called the Internet and was exploring the world.

I had quotes and news clips ofIn second sem, I focused primarily on programming and I got a few honours in the department competitions. That was the time Dr. Abdul Kalam came to our college and we got to present him an idea [of an anti-ballistic missile that would use neural networks to learn input patterns and plan trajectory]. In the 3 years since then I focused primarily on neural networks, genetic algorithms and programming.Third sem went fairly ordinary - practicing Java and building Generic Algorithms samples and in fourth sem we topped the department programming contests - the qualifiers for the prestigious ACM programming contests. At the end of the sem started preparing for the GRE.5th and 6th sems were the best of the lot. We went to the ACM ICPC Asia Regionals at Dhaka and got a Honorable Mention there. The Bangladesh trip was life changing, but quite disappointed not to make it to the world finals and dropped ACM preparation from then.

I was among the 12 Asians nominated for Young Inventors Awards by HP and later got a summer fellowship to build on that idea at IISc Bangalore.
