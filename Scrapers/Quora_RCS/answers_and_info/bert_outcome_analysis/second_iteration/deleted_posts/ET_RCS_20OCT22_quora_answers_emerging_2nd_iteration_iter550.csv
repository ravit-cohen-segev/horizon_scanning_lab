The protagonist and the enemies might be both characters or sprites, there are examples for both. (e.g. karate games with 2 big figures used character graphics, space shooting games used sprites, some a combination of both). I’ve never seen ANY game that actually used the graphics modes of the C64, all were character graphics plus sprites.So you had to store the character screen (40x25 = 1000 bytes) and the character generator (2048 bytes max, depending on how many characters are used) only. This is not very large for a C64 either. The level graphics always contained many repeating motifs, that’s ideal for handling as character graphics. It can be considered a sort of image compression. When the level was bigger than the physical screen, only the less than 1k character display had to be multiplied, while the character generator remained static.Usual data compression was also used. Not realtime, after completing a level, the next one was decompressed during showing the score.",549 followers,Kef Schecter,503,3K,3M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-8-bit-computers-store-large-level-maps-and-build-a-screen-from-them

(According toThere are also the following computer science based job openings.So, just glancing at the data shows a couple things. First, there is healthy demand for civil engineers, and substantial demand for industrial engineers. Second, there are more ME graduates than positions. Third, we aren’t graduating enough computer scientists or computer engineers. One caveat here is that this list is of job openings; I don’t think they include job closing data.There are additional problems with a mechanical engineering degree once you find a position. Basically, most new mechanical graduates function as a glorified draftsman upon employment. I don’t want to knock this job, a lot of people are very happy as CAD designers, but it seems pretty difficult to escape from these positions.

You can get around that problem some by connecting multiple chips in one package, like AMD is doing with their current high-end lineup:But even that has physical limits, though. At some point, you’re pumping too much power into too little space, and you can’t cool it off fast enough.So the solution is to spread that computation out among different chips that are physically separate, which we often do by having multi-CPU machines. You can also do load-sharing between specialized chips that are better at certain tasks, which is what we do with GPU co-processing.And then, at the highest level of performance, you can chain multiple physical machines together through a hyper-fast network.Supercomputers take advantage of all of these options at the same t...",5 followers,Wasim Momin,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Many-people-say-that-mechanical-engineering-is-a-dead-degree-Is-electrical-engineering-similarly-dead-or-does-it-have-a-bright-future-like-computer-science

Nothing happens in this shitty movie as there is a lot of talking but not enough action.

But it has a surprising number of positives:It’s not an all time great film - but it’s far better than its reputation (and had bad marketing for what it was; the marketing was selling the cosmic adventure which was the least interesting part).

This place all around us was created by and for one being: The Son.You, me, and everyone else are very sophisticated AIs. An AI is an artificial intelligence and compared to the only being who really exists, God, we are all artificial and made by design and for a purpose.When an AI decides to go rogue and do its own thing then the creator takes it out of the game in one way or another.Jesus Christ was and is The Son of God but not the entirety of the Son’s being. What I mean is that Jesus was the avatar used by The Son to enter into His own game. He was and is fully God and fully man.Jesus Himself had no power on His own to do miracles and wonders. That power came from the Holy Spirit. Jesus had to find out He was God over time. He wasn’t born knowing this but He left clues for Himself in the written Word so that He would, in time, find out who He was.So let me make this easy….imagine that there are two people in Heaven. One is a Dad who sits at a terminal. The other is a Son who sits at another terminal. They’re both playing a video game that the Son created and populated with His AI creations. These two sit in the REAL world. There’s no linear time there. (Actually, I’d tend to make the case that linear time is an illusion created by perceiving the passing of one moment to another.) The Dad and Son live where time doesn’t flow. They live in moments. New moments are created. None are ever destroyed. Both Dad and Son live simultaneously in every moment. Weird huh?Time here in this reality is an algorithm. I tend to think it’s like a time series with decay forecasting algorithm. Because decay is built into our reality. Anyway, the video game kind of goes sideways and the Son steps in to make some internal course corrections.But The Son never actually separates from the Dad and leaves where the Dad is. He kind of projects Himself into this world using His AI interface. That interface was Jesus and because He is derived from and connected to the Son He is God the Son.Imagine an aquarium. I stick my fingers into the water but leave the rest of my hand outside the water. Those fingers are still part of my hand. They’re just perceived as coming from out of nowhere from the point of view of the fish.Now as far as escaping the simulation you can and you can’t.

14,"Yes. You can.Actually the way was defined around 2500 years agoIf you want to escape from this simulated universe (or multiverse) you have to understand theFirst thing you must understand is thaYes. You can.Actually the way was defined around 2500 years agoIf you want to escape from this simulated universe (or multiverse) you have to understand theFirst thing you must understand is that suffering happens, it is unavoidable and it happens to everyone.Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering, union with what is displeasing is suffering, separation from what is pleasing is suffering, not to get what one wants is suffering.Actually it is not suffering in the sense of something that only involves physical pain or mental pain it involves a wider range of the unsatisfactory nature of reality that we really never get what we want. Whatever is pleasant will inevitably pass so it can't be relied upon. Even pleasure is unsatisfactory in that sense.So that is the first noble truth and it boosts us on the path to the extent that we don't see. Unless we don't realize the nature of lived reality as unsatisfactory we are never really going to get on the path.2.The second noble truth is about the origin of suffering and where this comes from. The origin of suffering is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there. That is craving for sensual pleasures (pleasure of the eyes, norse, tung etc), craving for existence (don't want to die), craving for non existence (want to die, not want to live now), craving for extermination. These are the origin of suffering.How and why that could be the origin of suffering ? and answer that question it will take a lifetime (or many lives) to really understand that, you really need to see it from an experiential level. Meditation will help you to understand that.We are distracted by what's surrounding us because it's so new and different and interesting. We tend not to think about these things and so what we are doing is a constant series of diversionary tactics to keep us away from reality.3.The cessation of suffering is the remainder less fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non reliance on it. To escape we have to give up this craving we have.4.a. First understand unsatisfactory nature of realityb. Once we understand this we begin to try to abandon this craving we have. That happens through an intellectual understanding, when we’ve come face to face with unsatisfactory nature, and we begin to see on a wider level through meditative practice. After that we naturally begin to relax around this craving because we realize that is not to our own benefit.c. Realize the cessation of suffering. We have to try to get ourselves to a position where we can begin to realize that cessation of suffering.d. Finally you will realize the way to the cessation of suffering by totally giving up your craving, desire, attachment.This is where you will escape from this simulated universe (or multiverse).","21,731 followers",Glyn Williams,12.4K,9.1K,52.9M,https://www.quora.com/Many-people-say-that-mechanical-engineering-is-a-dead-degree-Is-electrical-engineering-similarly-dead-or-does-it-have-a-bright-future-like-computer-science

For example, in every home on earth, a book could suddenly and simultaneously appear which tells the story of how this is a simulated universe run by some entities for some purpose. Alternatively, the simulators could instantaneously implant that knowledge about us being in a simulated universe into the brains of all humans.

Maybe they invented the idea of solid matter specifically so that it’d be easier to simulate, in the same way that if we were trying to simulate a universe we’d probably crank the graphics way down low to make it run better. The beings inside the simulation wouldn’t be able to tell, that’s their entire universe, they’ve got nothing to compare it to, they don’t know it all looks like shitty Minecraft to us.So it should by now (and have always been) obvious that the answer is: it depends. It’s the least satisfying answer ever, but it’s the most applicable. We just don’t know shit. Not anything. And we probably can’t know it, either.Us escaping the simulated universe would be like a comic book character wanting to turn into a real person in the real world.
