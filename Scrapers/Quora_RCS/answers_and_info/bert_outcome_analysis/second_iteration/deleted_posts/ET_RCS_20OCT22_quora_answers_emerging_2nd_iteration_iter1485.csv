7,"1. FinanceMost academic advisors recommend that students who want to become stockbrokers choose a degree in finance or financial services. Many schools offer bachelor’s degree programs, and some schools offer master’s degree programs in this field.How a Finance Degree HelpsStockbrokers must conduct thorough and meticulous financial analyses. They must know the right methods to use to make critical decisions that help their clients. Also, they must know how to make investment decisions and how to perform the right research to make those decisions. Stockbrokers must also have a firm understandin1. FinanceMost academic advisors recommend that students who want to become stockbrokers choose a degree in finance or financial services. Many schools offer bachelor’s degree programs, and some schools offer master’s degree programs in this field.How a Finance Degree HelpsStockbrokers must conduct thorough and meticulous financial analyses. They must know the right methods to use to make critical decisions that help their clients. Also, they must know how to make investment decisions and how to perform the right research to make those decisions. Stockbrokers must also have a firm understanding of financial planning to help their clients create strategies that focus on the present and the future. Additionally, they must know how to use the right management techniques to maintain client accounts and relationships. In a finance or financial services degree program, students learn each of these skills and more. They also learn important communication skills to help them work with a variety of stakeholders.Types of Classes in Finance Degree ProgramsSome schools offer students the opportunity to earn a finance degree with a special area of focus. For example, some may offer degree specializations in corporate finance or a similar field. These are a few of the subjects that are included in a finance degree program:2. AccountingAccounting is another good degree choice. An accounting degree program gives aspiring stockbrokers a thorough knowledge of all accounting principles, tax matters, basic business operations and more.How an Accounting Degree HelpsWhen stockbrokers develop plans and analyze trends, they must be able to use calculations to make predictions and accurately quantify past trends. One reason why accounting is so useful for stockbrokers is that they learn important information relating to taxes. Although some clients may have accountants of their own that stockbrokers will work with, this is not the case in every firm or position. Understanding the tax implications of different decisions can be especially beneficial when stockbrokers use their other skills to identify economic trends, develop financial plans and work on other important tasks.Types of Classes in Accounting Degree ProgramsTo become certified as an accountant, a degree holder must have a minimum of 150 credit hours of qualifying education. Public accounting programs satisfy this. However, some bachelor’s programs are only 120 credit hours. Although most3. BusinessAlthough some schools offer business management or business administration degrees, others offer general business degree paths. There may be a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts choice. The main difference is that a bachelor of science program focuses more on technical skills, and the bachelor of arts program focuses more on communication and writing. Communication, writing and technical skills are all useful for stockbrokers. Since there is no specific degree path to becoming a stockbroker, both degree choices are good.How a Business Degree HelpsStockbrokers need to have sharp analytical skills and the ability to make complex calculations. Although they often work with individuals, many work with companies and organizations as well. When this is the case, it helps to have a deep understanding of how businesses earn and allocate money. A degree in business gives a student a broader perspective about economics, finance, management and a variety of other useful topics. These are all necessary for stockbrokers. A general business degree, whether it has a focus on arts or sciences, will help a person prepare for the necessary functions of becoming a personal or institutional stockbroker.Types of Classes in Business Degree ProgramsThe specific classes vary depending on the degree program. Some schools offer a minor or a specialty focus option as well. These are some examples of the main types of4. International BusinessThis degree path has a strong focus on practical applications of business. However, it also focuses on international relations in business.How an International Business Degree HelpsA degree in international business can open up new opportunities for stockbrokers in the future. This is true for those who seek employment in firms or choose to work on their own. With a degree in international business, a person gains a broader knowledge of international business principles, finance with an international focus and global economy issues. These are all important to know for working with international markets. Although stockbrokers in the United States may not be able to directly trade on foreign exchanges, they can work with licensed international brokers in certain locations to offer a broader range of choices to individual and institutional clients. For those who are looking to expand and offer more services than competitors, this can be highly advantageous.Types of Classes in International Business Degree ProgramsSome programs have internship requirements. For example, one school requires students to complete a domestic internship and a foreign internship to finish the degree program. People who consider this degree path should understand all internship requirements and financial implications before enrolling. These are some examples of classes in an international business degree program:5. EconomicsEconomics is the study of the economy and the factors that influence it. In the United States, foreign trade, conflicts, technology trends and many other factors affect the economy.How an Economics Degree HelpsSince many issues affect the economy in the United States, public companies are also affected. Although internal issues and other factors also affect their performance on a stock exchange, the economy is a complex part of the puzzle that is highly beneficial for stockbrokers to understand. When a stockbroker understands economics, it is easier to conduct thorough research and use important insights to help guide suggestions for clients. In an economics program, a student learns about the different components of the economy, the financial aspects that affect it and how all the components fit together to produce important information about trends. Being able to make economic predictions based on past trends is also a helpful skill that students may learn.Types of Classes in Economics Degree ProgramsAspiring stockbrokers who choose an economics degree path also create other future career opportunities if they want to pursue a second goal or change paths later. There are a wide variety of other careers, such as economist, bank examiner, financial analyst and more. These are some of the main types of classes in an economics program:6. Business AdministrationBusiness administration prepares students to handle a wide array of business management aspects, and they can choose a special area of study. For example, they may choose healthcare administration, finance, information technology or human resources. There are many other choices. Several schools offer a bachelor’s degree in business administration. However, people who want to become stockbrokers and eventually move up in a firm to senior roles should consider a master’s degree in business administration. It only takes about an extra two years or less to complete an online MBA program.How a Business Administration Degree HelpsBusiness administration helps a person understand the complexities of planning a business, running a business and even planning exit strategies. Students learn about identifying threats, weaknesses, opportunities and more. They learn about business strategies, finance, investments, economics and other financial topics. These are all important skills for a stockbroker. It helps to pick a cognate or specialty that relates to stockbroking, such as finance, economics, international business or accounting.Types of Classes in Business Administration Degree ProgramsIn a master’s program, the classes are more applied and go deeper into subjects that students learn during a bachelor’s degree program. In addition to the classes that a student chooses for a specialty, these are the types of classes in a bachelor’s degree program for business administration:7. Business ManagementAlthough business management and business administration include many of the same classes, they are somewhat different. The main difference is that a degree in business management focuses more on organizing and planning, and a degree in business administration provides a robust background with the opportunity to choose a specialty area.How a Business Management Degree HelpsSince business management degree programs teach organizational, research and planning skills, students gain a better understanding of how to apply those skills as a stockbroker. A stockbroker must be able to plan, manage and maintain multiple accounts. This requires a high level of detail-oriented behavior. Also, business management includes important classes that relate to economics, finance, accounting and other subjects that help stockbrokers complete their research to make informed and smart recommendations.Types of Classes in Business Management Degree ProgramsIf stockbrokers want to pursue a different career later, they have many options with a degree in business management. These are the main types of classes that are included in a bachelor’s degree program in this field:8. StatisticsStatistics involves analyzing data sets and turning the information into useful ratios or other calculations. In some related degree programs, students learn the basics of using statistical computations, and they may take a class or two about theories. However, a degree in statistics provides more in-depth knowledge of complex calculations, theories and methods of reporting.How a Statistics Degree HelpsStockbrokers can use a wide variety of ratios to determine the health of a business. For example, if a stockbroker wants to research a company to see if it will be a good investment option, the broker may use ratios to measure profitability, liquidity and more. These ratios can be more difficult to understand without an in-depth knowledge of statistics. Also, stockbrokers use a variety of ratios that are related to financial data, and a statistics degree program typically includes a good education about financial statements and business finance principles.Types of Classes in Statistics Degree ProgramsThe classes in these degree programs are mostly in science categories. Some colleges offer a general studies degree with a focus in statistics, and others offer a bachelor’s degree specifically in statistics. Also, many colleges offer a master’s degree in statistics for those who want to become statisticians. These are the main types of classes in bachelor’s degree programs:Since a statistics degree program is so heavily focused on practical applications, students who want to sharpen their written and verbal communication skills should take supplemental classes. Also, it helps to take a few extra classes in business and economics.9. Strategic CommunicationsStrategic communication principles can help students learn how to communicate effectively with individuals, potential clients and the public. They may learn how to do this through verbal and electronic communication channels, such as social media.How a Strategic Communications Degree HelpsStockbrokers have a competitive field to work in, and communication is a key to good leadership skills. They must know how to strategically communicate with potential clients and current clients to maintain them. Being able to communicate effectively with all types of stakeholders is important for boosting everything from client engagement to public confidence. Also, it is essential to be able to utilize social media, email, video meetings and other forms of communication today.Types of Classes in Strategic Communications Degree ProgramsThere are a wide variety of electives that students can take. While this degree program may not be as good of a fit as one of the top five options on the list, it is adequate for its versatility in other required skills. These are some examples of relevant classes that most bachelor’s degree programs include:If desired, students can work with academic advisors to choose the right supplementary classes for useful business, economics and finance skills.10. CommunicationsSimilar to strategic communications, students learn the same core principles of communication through many forms in this degree path. However, the emphasis is more on effective communication instead of on strategies of communications.How a Communications Degree HelpsWhile this degree is helpful and can be utilized for communicating with clients and other stakeholders in the future, students may want to add some extra finance, business and economics courses if possible. Like strategic communications, this degree still makes the list because it equips students with the basic skills needed to start a career in broking.Types of Classes in Communications Degree ProgramsThese are some of the required core courses in a communications degree program:There are also a wide variety of electives that students can choose from for their elective requirements. Some of the options that may be useful for a future career as a stockbroker are technical writing, public relations and public speaking. These are useful for sharpening communication skills with stakeholders.Time Required for a DegreeThe good news is that most of the degrees listed on this guide are available as 100% online courses. Many schools also offer on-campus courses and programs for students who do not prefer a virtual learning environment. Some schools require students to complete internships at local businesses. For an undergraduate degree, the minimum requirement is 120 credit hours. Each class is usually three credit hours, and some classes are four credit hours. Half-time students take about six credit hours per term, and full-time students take 12 credit hours per term. As a full-time student, it typically takes almost four years to finish a degree program without any transfer credits or CLEP credits.Choosing the Right Degree PathAnyone with any type of bachelor’s degree may be able to find a job at the entry level that leads to becoming a stockbroker. However, those who are already in a program that is not on this list can take extra classes online to supplement economics, accounting, finance or business deficiencies. There are some free classes on these subjects from open-source programs, and there are plenty of tuition-based classes as well. Students who are planning to enroll in a degree program and are looking to choose the right path to become a stockbroker can benefit the most from one of the top five recommendations on this list. Additionally, pursuing a master’s in business administration is a good choice for those who want to eventually move into senior or leadership roles.",421 followers,David Wagle,847,1.4K,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/If-someone-really-wants-to-specialize-in-stock-trading-what-college-degree-is-most-beneficial-to-obtain

I pay for my own insurance, keep a roof over my family’s head, keep food in the fridge and take a vacation every couple years or so.So, yes, I can make a ‘living’ trading.Can you?Probably not.And I say that with the most utter and supreme confidence that I can muster. There are very few things I am absolutely certain about - butWhy?Because it is nearly impossible. Listen - most people have absolutely no idea what kind of a mind f**k trading is. Literally - almost no one does. I’ve met 5 total independent traders like me - and I’m about the most normal one out of that 5. The others are just phenomenal traders, gods among men, its magic what they can do - but they are each of them a wreck of a human being. They’ve lost their families and their sanity. They’ve experienced such psychological and emotional suffering from their journey to profitability that they are forever blessed and cursed from that journey.Trading will ruin you. If, by the grace of God, you survive trading and becoming profitable, you won’t be the same. You will be forever changed in both your mood and your mannerisms. YouTrading is the antithesis of normal human behavior because, in order to make money, you have to risk the thing that keeps a roof over your head, food in your belly, clothes on your back and provides those things for your family as well - you have to risk your money.I got lucky. I have the most amazing and supportive wife in the world. I try to remember to tell folks that my ability to be a profitable trader, my journey to profitability, the results I currently have - it’s a partnership between me and my wife.I can not tell you what kind of sh*t she had to put up with or the anxiety and pain I put our family through so thatSo I got lucky. I suffered horrible shame and self-loathing after blowing two large accounts - all of my life savings because I am a God-damned idiot. But my wife knew my passion and knew I was good at it, I just had to tackle the things that were limiting my ability to be profitable.But to your question? No - you don’t make a living as a day trader.Day trading is a lifestyle - it’s part of who I am, it’s a constant and as much a part of my soul as anything else in my life.

While it's cooking, you wake yourself up by reading newYoYou wake up late and slightly exhausted from overworking the day before, and shuffle-limp to the kitchen to make yourself some breakfast. While it's cooking, you wake yourself up by reading newYou go to your table, open up your laptop and check your email. There is an announcement of a seminar later today, but you won't go there — years later you will regret it immensely, but for now you lead yourself to believe you don’t have time for that. You also see another email, from your supervisor: he proposes something he calls a “good venue” for the paper you two are working on. You get up and go to his office to discuss it further, and he explains that the strange combination of capital letters is a well-known 42nd international conference on so-and-so, and how he thinks the community is good, and you try your best to not look as bored as you are, until he switches to actually discussing the contents of the paper. You briefly present results of your recent experiments, he proposes a way to explain them and to get a broader picture from them. He also suggests that you read a couple of papers by people you’ve never heard of, and tells you that the “deadline” is in half a year from now, which only solidifies your point of view that you’re running out of time.You get back to your table and rerun some experiments, puzzled about how much different they are from what you have just discussed, and you play around with them until the lunch brigade comes along and drags you to the local cafeteria, where you will try to find an optimal place to sit: not too close to those colleagues who are into politics (they will keep talking for two hours straight, and it will be awkward to stand up and leave), but also not too close to colleagues with kids (the only topic they will ever participate in) and to all those foreign students who seem nice but you have no idea what they are talking about, because you cannot get through the accent. If you’re lucky, some nice topics pop up, and you either learn something new or get into a heated discussion on a topic somewhat related to you (not that uncommon to achieve both).Back from lunch with a fresh cup of coffee, you decide to read those papers your supervisor has mentioned. You google them up, open the PDF and quickly figure out that the only thing you understand is the title of the bloody thing. After spending half an hour on the abstract, you arrive at the conclusion that you misunderstood the title before. However, some bibliography references look promising, so you google them up as well, and finally print out a huge pile of papers and add them to the ever-growing “must read” pile. You also take one off the pile and fight your way through it, oscillating through bright moments of insight and dark periods of opaque descriptions and quirky notation. When you’re done with that one paper, the bliss is overwhelming, and you try not to think whetherYou try to choose another paper to read, but all this looking at other people’s ideas gives you an unexpected one of your own, so you put all of that away, sketch a couple of incomprehensible models on a whiteboard and leap back to the laptop to hack it up. The next couple of hours of your life are spent on happily playing around with the algorithm, its parameters, input data, visualisations and whatnot. 90% of your changes are so ornamental that they will disappear without any trace very soon, 9% will stick around for some reason, and 1% will become a crucial component to a turning point in your career five years from now.It’s getting dark, so you bike home while taking a dozen of must read papers with you, in vain hope to read them before tomorrow.

With a couple of years of experience in this industry, I would like to list down a few problems with Big Data in a very simple way!(1) Where would you keep/put it?The first confusion arises when there is already a lot of data existing and another set of important data flocks in! Where do you keep/put it? In some hardware or on the cloud? How often would you access it? Will you deal with the latency? So every time, you will have to ask such questions because data is different, its value is different.(2) The Big BiasWell, it is quite simple to understand that the more options you have, the more you get confused! The same happens here! For example, analyzing 100 surveys, there can be much more nuanced issues within that data.(3) The False PositivesSometimes, people rush decisions based on a subset of data (thinking fast). A better practice is to “think slow” and really rationalize the data. With big data, thinking fast (not analyzing the data fully) would lead to false positives.(4) The Big Complexity IssueIn simple words, one has to find a signal from the noise or one has to find a needle from a huge stack. So there will always be a Big Complexity Issue.(5) I was looking for something elseIt is funny, but sometimes Big Data tools lead you to shortcuts which isn't what the user was looking for! Big Data systems think they have found a better way, but actually, it could be a wrong way!So these are just a few basic problems.","45,767 followers",Jeff Hammerbacher,1.6K,1.3K,6.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-for-CA-inter-taxation-for-the-May-20-attempt

Yet we have the ""It's not rocket science"" myth. In the same way we have an IT myth, created in the first phase when no-one knew what this new-fangled computer stuff could do or what was involved. People appointed themselves as experts and charged fortunes. A whole generation of aggressive companies grew up around providing horrendously expensive hardware and tying companies into inflexible long-term contracts based on number of CPUs, concurrent users and all the language of the confuseopoly - a way to charge more.When the hardware myth was finally busted, these companies moved onto software. SAP, Oracle and IBM bought up every available software company and created the myths of ERP, CRM and HR Management as ways to sell software - not forgetting the aggressive, tie you in and lock the other guy out, pay for lots of seats you don't use and 20% maintenance contracts - oh and the £1k/day per consultant to actually push the buttons to make it do anything.Those myths are busted too. So where do those companies go - into data, of course. The last frontier of IT complexity (well maybe not - they're in Internet of Things as well). They've brought their methodologies with them.BigData - as in ""big, frightening, you couldn't possibly understand it""They're still peddling consultants at a grand a pop. Still saying hand your company to us. Still tying you into long term contracts you can't easily get out of. Spinning buzzwords so you gain job status points by buying the latest jargon. New field - same old aggressive sales techniques. And are you fooled - you betcha! Hence questions like this - these people want you to believe datascience is hard and beset with problems only they can solve (so get out your cheque book).That's not DataScience. That's snake-oil.
