Now hear thisAnd just like any company that blissfully ignored the Internet at the turn of the century, the ones that dismiss the Internet of Things risk getting left behind.”But instead of choosing an out-of-the-box network structure, organizations are still unfolding IoT and developing their IoT network architecture based on current contact points. However, a successful configuration depends on the type of industry or market that the IoT applications operate in.EffectiveA simple search of the phrase “IoT” on Google gives well over 200 million results, an amazing figure right.

However, a successful configuration depends on the type of industry or market that the IoT applications operate in.Effective IoT infrastructure plans involve two or three layers that ultimately relay data and analytical measurements based on the data collected by the sensor or embedded system, either in real-time or in batches.Let’s understand these few simple layers:Now its time to understand IoT network architecture in terms of componentsIoT device-Communication-Simply how a machine communicates its informationAccording to a Gartner researchTwo basic architectures address communication infrastructure requirements for organizations:1.Wide-area communication (cellular-based, WAN & LPWAN)2.Cloud application or on-premises(local area wireless, including Wi-Fi)SecurityTo protect IoT devices and platforms from breaches, security technologies are necessary. Connected devices that have been in use for many years must communicate with newer connected devices safely and securely.Gateway-For the things that are connected to it, gateways can house the application logic, store data, and communicate with the internet, and perform protocol conversion.Platform IoT-It tends to be where some of the upper-layer logic is located that can communicate to the gateway, but can also guide the applications.The Application-The application allows users to interact. For instance, to monitor and control their cars or smart homes.Business requirements determine component arrangementsAll the components exist, but depending on what the desired result is their position may differ perhaps a little bit. It is essential to understand what the business trying to accomplish and then look for all the components that may affect some of the decision-making capabilities within the framework.","6,727 followers",Barsha Sedhain,88.9K,127,7.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-develop-internet-of-things
1,You don’t develop IoT you just make devices with support of Communication remotely there comes the development. And you have to make sure that the Device can communicate with other devices in vicinity and through internet for the control commands.,UNKNOWN,Amarnath,13.1K,131,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-develop-internet-of-things

4,"Seriously, another IoT platform, please be very thoughtful before working on to develop one. As per study by Zinnov, there are now more than 400+ IoT platforms and the market is super fragmented.If you mean how do I create a simple IoT solution then I can advise you in depth but assuming you still want to create a platform lets understand few key categories of platforms in the market and their role in the IoT ecosystem.Seriously, another IoT platform, please be very thoughtful before working on to develop one.

Sounds Cool, Right.!That is called IoT(Internet of Things)As you can see from the picture above, IoT comes in handy not only for Television as I mentioned above, it applies to all the things we use in our day-to-day life.What is IoT?Technically, IoT is defined as a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people, that are given unique identifiers assisting with the ability to transmit data over a network automatically without human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.From the Internet of Things, the things mentioned can be of anything, which can be a pet with a remote sensor tied around its collar neck or a garden with censors underneath to know the moisture level of the soil frequently or it can be any living or non-living thing with censors present to connect with computing devices.Origin and Evolution of IoTThe IoT term was first got invented or introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 while he was working in supply chain optimization; as he wanted to attract his higher official's attention, he introduced a new exciting technology called RFID in the early internet days in that year.Then he gave his presentation on IoT(Internet of Things), but the term did not get popular until the next 10 years.Internet of Things started becoming popular in 2010; that's when people came to know that Google Streetview captures not only 360 degrees pictures but also stores tons of information about people's wifi networks. Hence, people started debating that Google's new strategy to register its role on the internet or register to a whole new physical world.IoT took a vast peak in January 2014, that's when Google declared to buy Nest for $3.2 billion, and the Consumers Electronic show got held with the IoT theme at the same time in Los Vegas.As Kevin Ashton stated, IoT has become the highest potential key point for technology growth similar to the internet.Almost from the beginning of the 21st century, the IoT started taking a drastic peak because of the massive use by the media through the outlets like The Guardian, Forbes, The Boston Globe to make a note of it.LG Electronics did the First practical implementation of IoT through a refrigerator connected with the internet to permit its users to purchase online through video calls to view the product live before purchasing.Then the subsequent critical development of IoT was done by a small bunny-shaped robot named 'Nabaztag' created in 2005, which is capable of telling the latest news and weather forecasts.Then later, in support of the IoT boom, IPv6 -network layer protocol central to IoT in 2011 was inaugurated publicly.The IoT boom was also supported by the Gartner Hype Cycle for revolutionary technologies in the same year, i.e., 2011.From then onwards, interconnected devices have become the vast spread and a standard part of our daily lives.Highly reputed tech giants like Google, Apple, and Cisco started concentrating on making efforts to produce IoT sensors and devices with their remark, i.e. from smart glasses to automated cars.What IoT is not aboutHowever, IoT is ruling our Lifestyle, but still, few misconceptions are objecting for its massive widespread everywhere in the world.· Misconception-1: Iot Equipment is expensive to implementYes, IoT equipment and devices were costly to afford during their starting days but not now.As the internet and the IoT devices sensors prices are becoming affordable day by day, even the small-scale industries and consumers can use it.· Misconception-2: IoT devices are insecure and unsafe for daily usage.No, IoT devices are safe as they have multiple security layers to assist in protecting for ensuring the safety of data, and specific preventive measures will also be taken according to the need.· Misconception-3: IoT is only about connecting devices to the internetYes, IoT is about connecting devices to the internet, but it's not only about thatIt involves a wide range of networks like Cloud, API. Gateways, etc.Why is IoT Important?Now, Let us see why IoT is essential in our daily Lifestyle.Ü IoT is essential for collecting a vast amount of data because more devices means better work and better decisions to improve the situation.Ü IoT devices will be helpful for tracking and monitoring whatever you want to with the help of censors when you are away.Ü IoT devices make your work easier by automating everything they can to reduce human efforts and strain.Ü IoT devices save your money and resources with increased efficiency. When your electrical appliances automatically turn off when you leave the premises, in turn, reduce your electricity bills from which you can save money.Ü IoT devices lead to a better lifestyle, when things can get done automatically for you without your intervention by reducing stress and strain, which helps you lead a better life.ConclusionIoT devices are nothing but devices getting connected to the internet over a wide range of networks that help collect a large amount of data, reduce human strain, and sometimes do the work without any human aid, saving your time and money.IoT devices are beneficial in the medical field; for example, when a patient gets a heart transplant, one can monitor the patient's well-being with the help of sensors attached to their device.Similarly, you can track any person or even a non-living thing with the help of sensors.IoT is now ruling the world, irrespective of tech giant companies even the small-scale industries started using the IoT devices. Even common people are very interested in getting their home or things automated in this vast growing technology world.Though IoT has a few misconceptions, it will be the hot buzz trending technology as long as the internet exists.So, do let me know your experiences after and before using IoT devices in the comments below",127 followers,Sachin Jha,2.7K,287,14.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-develop-internet-of-things
