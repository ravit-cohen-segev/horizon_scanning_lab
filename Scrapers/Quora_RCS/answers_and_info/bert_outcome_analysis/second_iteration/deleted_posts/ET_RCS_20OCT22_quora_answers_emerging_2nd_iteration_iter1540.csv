I had expected a proper impact assessment document with quantitative analytics into probabilities and ranges of economic and services disruptions expected (which would be in most professional impact assessments). But maybe this is just the high-level summary here. Anyway, in case you have not seen even this high-level summary, here are apparently the highlights of the leaked document:THE YELLOWHAMMER REPORTNo-deal Brexit preparations: the leaked Operation Yellowhammer documentThe Sunday TimesBASE SCENARIOWhen the UK ceases to be a member of the European Union in October 2019, all rights and reciprocal arrangements with the EU end.KEY PLANNING ASSUMPTIONSExit dayFor the purpose of freight flow and traffic management, as October 31 is a Thursday, Day 1 of Exit is now on a Friday rather than the weekend, which is not to our advantage. Exit Day may coincide with the half-term holiday, which varies across the UK.Member statesIn a small number of instances where the impacts of Brexit would be felt negatively in the EU as well as in the UK, member states may act in a way that could benefit the UK.Channel portsFrance will impose EU mandatory controls on UK goods on Day 1 of No Deal and has built infrastructure and IT systems to manage and process customs declarations and to support a risk-based control regime. On Day 1 of No Deal, 50%-85% of HGVs travelling via the short straits may not be ready for French customs. The lack of trader readiness combined with limited space in French ports to hold “unready” HGVs could reduce the flow rate to 40%-60% of current levels within one day.The worst disruption to the short Channel crossings might last 3 months before flow rates rise to about 50%-70% (as more traders get prepared), although disruption could continue much longer. In the event of serious disruption, the French might act to ensure some flow through the short Channel crossings.Disruption to Channel flow would also cause significant queues in Kent and delays to HGVs attempting to use the routes to travel to France. In a reasonable worst-case scenario, HGVs could face a maximum delay of 1½-2½ days before being able to cross the border. HGVs caught up in congestion in the UK will be unable to return to the EU to collect another load and some logistics firms may decide to avoid the route. Analysis to date has suggested a low risk of significant sustained queues at ports outside Kent that have high volumes of EU traffic, but the Border Delivery Group will continue to work directly with stakeholders at those ports to support planning readiness.Border checksUK citizens travelling to and from the EU may be subject to increased immigration checks at border posts. This may lead to passenger delays at St Pancras, Cheriton (Channel tunnel) and Dover, where border controls are juxtaposed. Depending on what plans EU member states put in place to cope with these increased immigration checks, it is likely delays will occur for UK arrivals and departures at EU airports and ports. This could cause some disruption on transport services. Travellers may decide to use alternative routes to complete their journey.Drugs and diseasei) The Border Delivery Group/Department for Transport planning assumption on reduced flow rates describes a pre-mitigation reasonable worst-case flow rate that could be as low as 40% on Day 1 of No Deal via the short straits [main Channel crossings], with significant disruption lasting up to six months. Unmitigated, this will have an impact on the supply of medicines and medical supplies.Supply chains for medicines and medical products rely heavily on the short straits, which makes them particularly vulnerable to severe delays: three-quarters of medicines come via the short straits. Supply chains are also highly regulated and require transportation that meets strict Good Distribution Practices. This can include limits on transit times and temperature-controlled conditions. While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because of short shelf lives. It will not be practical to stockpile six months’ supplies. The Department for Health and Social Care is developing a multi-layered approach to mitigate these risks.ii) Any disruption that reduces, delays or stops the supply of medicines for UK veterinary use would reduce our ability to prevent and control disease outbreaks, with potential harm to animal health and welfare, the environment and wider food safety and availability, as well as, in the case of zoonotic diseases, posing a risk to human health. Industry stockpiling will not be able to match the 4-12 weeks’ stockpiling that took place in March 2019. Air freight capacity and the special import scheme are not a financially viable way to mitigate risks associated with veterinary medicine availability issues.Food and wateri) Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease. Critical elements of the food supply chain (such as ingredients, chemicals and packaging) may be in short supply. In combination, these two factors will not cause an overall shortage of food in the UK but will reduce availability and choice and increase the price, which will affect vulnerable groups. The UK growing season will have come to an end, so the agri-food supply chain will be under increased pressure for food retailers. Government will not be able to fully anticipate all effects on the agri-food supply chain. There is a risk that panic buying will disrupt food supplies.ii) Public water services are likely to remain largely unaffected, thanks to actions now being taken by water companies. The most significant single risk is a failure in the chemicals supply chain. The likelihood of this is considered low, and the impact is likely to be local, affecting only hundreds of thousands of people. Water companies are well prepared for any disruption: they have significant stocks of all critical chemicals, extensive monitoring of their chemicals supply chains (including transport and deliveries) and sharing agreements in place. In the event of a supply chain failure, or the need to respond rapidly to other water supply incidents, urgent action may need to be taken to make sure people continue to have access to clean water.Law and orderLaw enforcement data and information-sharing between the UK and the EU will be disrupted.Financial services and insuranceSome cross-border UK financial services will be disrupted. A small minority of insurance payments from UK insurers into the EU may be delayed.DataThe EU will not have made a data decision with regard to the UK before exit. This will disrupt the flow of personal data from the EU, where an alternative legal basis for transfer is not in place. In no-deal, an adequacy assessment could take years.FuelTraffic disruption caused by border delays could affect fuel distribution in the local area, particularly if traffic queues In Kent block the Dartford crossing, which would disrupt fuel supply in London and the southeast. Customer behaviour could lead to shortages in other parts of the country.Tariffs make UK petrol exports to the EU uncompetitive. Industry had plans to mitigate the impact on refinery margins and profitability, but UK government policy to set petrol import tariffs at 0% inadvertently undermines these plans. This leads to big financial losses and the closure of two refineries (which are converted to import terminals) with about 2,000 direct job losses. Resulting strike action at refineries would lead to disruptions to fuel availability for 1-2 weeks in the regions they directly supply. Government analysis of the impact of no-deal on refineries continues.Northern IrelandOn Day 1 of No Deal, Her Majesty’s government will activate the “no new checks with limited exceptions” model announced on March 13, establishing a legislative framework and essential operations and system on the ground, to avoid an immediate risk of a return to a hard border on the UK side.The model is likely to prove unsustainable because of economic, legal and biosecurity risks. With the UK becoming a “third [non-EU] country”, the automatic application of EU tariffs and regulatory requirements for goods entering Ireland will severely disrupt trade. The expectation is that some businesses will stop trading or relocate to avoid either paying tariffs that will make them uncompetitive or trading illegally; others will continue to trade but will experience higher costs that may be passed on to consumers. The agri-food sector will be hardest hit, given its reliance on complicated cross-border supply chains and the high tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.Disruption to key sectors and job losses are likely to result in protests and direct action with road blockades. Price and other differentials are likely to lead to the growth of the illegitimate economy. This will be particularly severe in border communities where criminal and dissident groups already operate with greater freedom. Given the tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, there will be pressure to agree new arrangements to supersede the Day 1 model within days or weeks.Energy suppliesDemand for energy will be met, and there will be no disruption to electricity or gas interconnectors. In Northern Ireland there will not be immediate disruption to electricity supply on Day 1. A rapid split of SEM could occur months or years after the EU Exit. In this event there would not be issues about security of supply. However, there will probably be marked price rises for electricity customers (business and domestic), with associated wider economic and political effects. Some participants could exit the market, exacerbating economic and political effects.GibraltarBecause of the imposition of checks at its border with Spain (and the knock-on effect of delays from the UK to the EU), Gibraltar will see disruption to the supply of goods (including food and medicines) and to shipments of waste, plus delays of four-plus hours for at least a few months in the movement of frontier workers, residents and tourists across the border.Prolonged border delays over the longer term are likely to harm Gibraltar’s economy. As on the UK mainland, cross-border services and data flow will be disrupted. Despite the time extension to the UK’s exit from the EU, Gibraltar has still not taken the decisions to invest in contingency infrastructure (such as port adjustments and waste management equipment) and there are still concerns that Gibraltar will not have passed all necessary legislation for no-deal, opening up legal risks mainly for the government of Gibraltar. Gibraltar continues to plan for less significant border delays than in our Yellowhammer scenario. Crown dependencies may be affected by supply chain disruption.Brits in Europei) UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship and can expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time, or be required to access them on a different basis. All member states have now published legislative proposals, but not all have passed legislation to secure all rights for UK nationals.There is a mixed picture across member states in terms of the level of generosity and detail in the legislation. In some member states, UK nationals need to take action now. Complex administrative procedures within member states, language barriers and uncertainty regarding the UK political situation are contributing to some UK nationals being slow to take action. Demands for help on Her Majesty’s government will increase significantly, including an increase in consular inquiries and more complex and time-consuming consular assistance cases for vulnerable UK nationals.Cross-government support, including continued close engagement and clear communications from UK government departments and the departmental agencies, will be needed to help manage the demand.ii) An EU member state would continue to pay a pension it currently pays to a UK national living in the EU.iii) The commission and individual member states do not agree to extend the current healthcare arrangements for UK state pensioners and tourists beyond October 31, 2019, and refuse offers by the UK to fund treatments. Member states take no further action to guarantee healthcare for UK nationals and treat them in the same way as the other “third country” nationals. UK pensioners, workers, travellers and students will need to access healthcare in different ways, depending on the country. Healthcare systems may require people to demonstrate residency and current or previous employment, to enter a social insurance scheme or to purchase private insurance. Member states should treat people with urgent needs but may require them to pay after the fact. There is a risk of disruption for patients, and a minority could face substantial costs.Protests and policeProtests and counter-protests will take place across the UK, using up police resources. There may also be a rise in public disorder and community tensions.FishingUp to 282 EU and European Economic Area nations’ fishing vessels could enter illegally or are already fishing in UK waters: up to 129 vessels in English waters, 100 in Scottish waters, 40 in Welsh waters and 13 in Northern Irish waters on Day 1. This is likely to cause anger and frustration in the UK catching sector, which could lead to clashes between fishing vessels and an increase in non-compliance in the domestic fleet.Competing demands on UK government and maritime departmental agencies and their assets could put enforcement and response capabilities at risk, especially in the event of illegal fishing, border violations (smuggling and illegal migration) and any disorder or criminality arising as a result, eg violent disputes or blockading of ports.The poorLow-income groups will be disproportionately affected by rises in the price of food and fuel.Social careThere is an assumption that there will be no big changes in adult social care on the day after EU Exit. The adult social care market is already fragile because of the declining financial viability of providers.An increase in inflation after the UK’s EU exit would affect providers of adult social care through increasing staff and supply costs, and might lead to failure within 2-3 months for smaller providers and 4-6 months for larger ones. There are also local risks — transport or staff disruption, severe winter weather or flu — that could exacerbate existing market fragility and that cumulatively could stretch the resources of providers and local authorities.Intelligence will continue to be gathered to prepare for any effects on the sector, including closure of services and handing-back of contracts that are not part of the normal market function. In addition, by mid-August we will look at the status of preparations in four local authorities identified as concerns.The good news, of course, is the above is managed by a UK cabinet with a combined record of exactlyADDENDUMThe government was finally compelled to release the Operation Yellowhammer report which can be found on the link in this following answer:What do you think about the Yellowhammer impact document being released?Apparently, there are different versions of the report and the government’s version is claimed to be the “worst case assumptions” even though it is practically identical to the Sunday Times’ “Base Scenario”.

In the U.S, for example, I believe feminism is focusing on the wrong things and being connected to current gender studies college students does not bode well for their public image.The general populace in the U.S is getting what I call “outrage fatigue,” yet there are many who continue to find things to be outraged about and loudly. I think 3rd wave feminism being so convoluted and disorganized doesn’t help any in keeping their message clear. If they want to save their image they need to firmly reject those in feminism who perpetuate the men versus women narrative.Feminism should stand behind official organizations who can organize the spread of information to the populace and keeping feminists in line with the organizations goals and ideals. They could for example work on getting parental leave instead of maternal leave installed in most business in the U.S to eliminate a negative affect of hiring women (also helps shorten the pay gap). They should keep pushing for unrestricted access to birth control and for societal acceptance of those contraceptives. They should also keep pushing the message of choice for women in clothing and sexuality but not by promoting a victim mentality but one of confidence and critical thinking. Both men and women can wear whatever the hell they want and not be ashamed when they are attracted to one another. There are some aspects of current feminist thinking that are definitely not sex-positive and it doesn’t sit well with me. On the other hand I think the movement for toplessness being accepted for women is a bit misguided, that effort would be better applied to fighting for more tangible benefits for women.I think women would often benefit from efforts that help both men and women such as debunking the societal idea of “Disney Love,” that pushes the ideas of true love, hidden signals, and unrealistic expectations. Both men and women would eventually get used to asking each other directly for romantic reasons and cause a lot less self-inflicted heartache as well as learning how to communicate more effectively. Things like this are important for better relations between the sexes and I would prefer to see this handled by an egalitarian movement.I also hope that a organized and disciplined mens movement will arise to focus on current mens issues like inequality in child custody cases, bad contraception, death by suicide rates, violence against men (rape and assault, etc), and the list goes on. My ideal vision is these two movements working on their respective areas without regarding one another as rivals and a egalitarian movement to help tie them together and push for the benefit of all.","16,962 followers",Christian Winter,667,18.4K,79M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-thoughts-on-the-leaked-Operation-Yellowhammer-report-on-the-No-Deal-Brexit
7,"Arman Siani said pretty much what I wanted to say, but there is one part of her speech that bothers me. More than anything else.“In 1997, Hillary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women’s rights. Sadly, many of the things that she wanted to change are still true today. But what stood out for me the most was that less than thirty percent of the audience were male.

How can we effect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation?”Out of all the things to be shocked about with 1997 Chinese Communist Party, Ms Watson is concerned about the gender imbalance? Out of all the things the CCP has done, specifically the people who are sitting in that chamber in 1997, gender imbalance was what registered?In 1989, the Tiananmen Square Massacre happened. People wanted an end to corruption, democratic reforms, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. It was the event where tanks were called in as part of the crack down. Official government figures places the death count at 218 civilians, 10 PLA soldiers, and 13 police. Other estimates put up the deaths all the way up to 10,454 civilians and around 50 soldiers and policemen.It is very likely that the people involved in the Massacre were still sitting in government when Clinton gave her speech about women’s rights. And the big thing Ms Watson was concerned about was the gender inequality.To be fair, Clinton was talking about women’s rights but still. Probably would’ve been wiser to not talk about the CCP in general. Because talking about gender imbalance when refering to a party that called in tanks to deal with civilian protests, as well as being incredibly corrupt and totalitarian, is like complaining about mud on the windshield, when the windshield is absolutely broken.The point I’m making here, is that Watson claims to have done her research, but really hasn’t. She doesn’t help the stereotype that celebrities are detatched from reality.Few other points I would like to address:“When at 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they didn’t want to appear muscly.”Unless her friends are taking testosterone for body building, there is literally nothing to be worried about. I played hockey and fencing alongside girls who started in pewee, they do not have broader shoulders than me or bigger biceps - and I’m only 5′8.“Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one? I am from Britain, and I think it is right I am paid the same as my male counterparts.”Free market. You are paid because of how much you are worth. If you’re being underpaid, then another firm will pay you what you deserve if you go and search for it. The free market is incredibly brutal to those who overpay or underpay their workers.Then there was that morsal she gave to men and how she talked about suicide rates, which is appreciated but tis a mere morsal.She goes on to talk about education for girls in rural Africa - honestly thought she should’ve focused more on this than talk about her first world life in Britain. And finally, couldn’t help but notice she didn’t talk about sex trafficking and child soldiers. But hey, we can’t have everything.Anyway, to address the OP’s question,Indifferent. Feminism comes in so many flavours it’s so convulted. Some will say it’s for gender equality (wouldn’t you call yourself an egalitarian then? or a humanist?), others will say it’s about female supremacy - and considering how many affirmative action policies are being passed, I am more inclined to agree with them.Then you have the likes of Annita Sarkeesian, a self proclaimed feminist who during the height of her fame was talking about sexism in gaming, and conned her followers out of ~US$1M to fund her videos.Ultimately, I care about the individual’s values, not some label which is subjected to so much change.","16,406 followers",Chris Everett,1.8K,11K,78.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-thoughts-on-the-leaked-Operation-Yellowhammer-report-on-the-No-Deal-Brexit

Feminist movements in countries where people aren't equal socially and legallly have a good reason to be there for women and men if they're there for equality, and from what I have seen in debates opposing opinions are shut down and the speakers are attacked or disinvited from colleges, which isn't the purpose of college to make you think and challenge you and your views? Not be a daycare?Emma Watson is a good actress but she didn't do a good job, yes it was emotional but was that really all she had? Yes it was emotional but where were the facts?? I maybe heard two and they were okay, she needs to rework the speech because from what I've read and seen men aren't emotional, we are factual. Yes we are emotional towards small helpless things but that's common for other species to, it's not just humans. It seemed she wanted equality and was mainly talking to men but most of her points seemed man bashing more than anything else, that doesn't help her cause it pushes people away who actually believe in equality and the target audience.If she was using her wealth and recognition to help women and men in poorer countries to get access to water and food and being able to sustain themselves then trying to get equality for both genders equally I think she'd have more lots more support than a speech. Anyone remember Anita Sarcessian at the UN talking about how mean comments should be banned in google, which they need to but did anyone hear her slip in “oh you're wrong” saying that was hate speech? I feel like Emma Watson’s speech is like that but it wasn't well done, and she made it easy for people to take it the wrong way. If she was really pro women and men’s rights she would be focused on more of the social issues that have arised after all the work we have down to make women equal which have started hurting men because the systems are easy to take advantage of. And she'd say Saudi Arabia should be off the equal rights council because women aren't equal there, what about Israel?Oh wait, the UN seems to hate them.. irony..",316 followers,Nicholas Ritter,13.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/After-viewing-Emma-Watsons-HeForShe-speech-what-do-men-feel-about-the-feminism-movement

In many ways it comes from the very institutions of higher learning where Murphy earned her Womens Studies degrees.Colleges are currently dominated by a far-left philosophy, almost a pseudo religion, that cannot tolerate the expression of opinions that differ from the world view of the most extreme voices on the left.This is a logical consequence of what is happening in the classroom. The political philosophies being pushed in academia actually promote the idea that “logic and reason are tools of oppression.” Check outThe idea that people who disagree use reason as a basis of a conversation and that through reason we come to some mutual understanding, even if we agree to disagree, is the very bedrock of true liberalism.It was those mutually agreed upon rules that enabled he likes of Timothy Leary and G. Gordon Liddy to embark upon a joint speaking tour in 1982.It was what enabled Jerry Falwell and Larry Flynt to develop a friendship, even if the basis of that friendship with debating each other.After Falwell’s death, Hustler magazine publisher wrote of their odd friendship:“In the years that followed and up until his death, he’d come to see me every time he was in California. We’d have interesting philosophical conversations. We’d exchange personal Christmas cards. He’d show me pictures of his grandchildren. I was with him in Florida once when he complained about his health and his weight, so I suggested that he go on a diet that had worked for me. I faxed a copy to his wife when I got back home.”A liberal college would be a place where people with opposing views would engage in civilized debate, and that faculty and students alike would be eager to hear those ideas.One professor who relished the opportunity to debate someone with opposing views is Allison Stanger, who sought to debate controversial social scientists Charles Murray, co author of the Bell Curve. When she sought to challenge Murray and his views on a stage at Middlebury College, she and Murray were confronted by a mob that wouldn’t let them talk.Later that night, when the mob physically attacked Murray, Stanger tried to protect the older man. One of the attackers grabbed her by the hair and yanked her head. The assault sent her to the hospital with a neck injury.Murray is an advocate of aIn 2015,“Have we lost faith in young people’s capacity—in your capacity—to exercise self-censure, through social norming, and also in your capacity to ignore or reject things that trouble you? …What does this debate about Halloween costumes say about our view of young adults, of their strength and judgment? Whose business is it to control the forms of costumes of young people? It’s not mine, I know that.”Her Husband Nicholas, also a professor at Yale, agreed with her. I can understand that as I would never publicly disagree with my wife. But Both professors are advocates for a truly liberal model of a university.For agreeing with his wife Nicholas Christakis found himself surrounded by an angry mob insulting him and calling for a change in his employment status.The clip above shocked many, but it was nothing compared to what would happen to another professor with even more left-wing cred.I present the case ofIf you spend any time listening to Weinstein, you will see that by any objective standard, he isn’t just a man of the left, but he is a deeply committed progressive wanting America to adopt some, as yet, untried form of socialism.Despite being of the left, when Evergreen State College asked White faculty and staff to stay away for a civil rights-related day of absence, Weinstein sent this very carefully-worded letter of protest to colleagues and administration.For sending this very measured e-mail, Weinstein was targetted by his more radical-left colleagues who whipped students into a fury, then sent them out to disrupt his biology class.The students began with insults and profanity, but progressed to the point where armed students were searching cars (Portland Antifa style) for the professor. The campus police chief called Weinstein and told him not to come on campus because it wasn’t safe, and the college president had ordered the campus police to stand down…that is: the president ordered them to NOT PROTECT Professor Weinstein.This illiberal violence directed at Weinstein was stirred up by one of his very colleagues. Naima Lowe, an “art” professor at Evergreen State College who sees activism as the focus of her teaching.When some of her left-wing colleagues at Evergreen disagreed with her on how to achieve a more egalitarian campus, here’s how she responded. “You are now these motherf***ers that we’re pushing against. You can’t see your way out of your own ass.” She helped instigate verbal assaults on Professor Weinstein.Weinstein might be “deeply progressive,” as he describes himself, but when he disagreed with Lowe he found his classes being disrupted and his family being threatened by her students.By the way, this is what Professor Lowe’s “art” looks like:One can reasonably conclude that Lowe has limited earning potential in the private sector.So how did we get to the point where liberal, and even socialist, professors aren’t safe from radical mobs on campus, much less conservatives?There’s been something going on since the 1960s that German Marxist sociologistWhen you hear about all the crazy stuff happening on campuses, it’s largely as a result of the policies and culture that came about due to theNow the radicals who reshaped America’s universities were not your old school Marxists.They were part of what became known as the New Left, and they embraced a more radical version of Marxism called Critical Theory.Douglas Kellner, a proponent of the neo-Marxist Critical Theory, describes the evolution of thought from Karl Marx to what I had to learn to get my credential in California 20 years ago in“Alongside of the proliferation of neo-Marxian theories of culture and society and globalization of cultural studies, forms of an oppositional critical pedagogy emerged that explicitly criticized schooling in capitalist societies while calling for more emancipatory modes of education. In his now classic The Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1972), Brazilian educator and activist Paulo Freire criticized the ""banking concept of education"" while calling for more interactive, dialogical, and participatory forms of pedagogy that are parallel in interesting ways to those of John Dewey. While Dewey wanted education to produce citizens for democracy, however, Freire sought, in the spirit of Marxist revolutionary praxis, to develop a pedagogy of the oppressed that would produce revolutionary subjects, empowered to overthrow oppression and to create a more democratic and just social order.”Over he last 2 decades, many branches of humanities and social studies have embraced what is known isIn the early 20th Century, Marxism has become a political force. Proponents of Marxism made claims, and among them were:By the 1960s, data was rolling in and it didn’t turn out exactly how the proponents of Communism had intended. Among the pieces of evidence the intellectuals had to take into account.The mass starvation of Ukranians by the Soviet Untion.Forty-five million Chinese peasants being worked, beaten and intentionally starved to death during China’sThe numerous purges through which the likes of Lenin, Staling and Mao killed more communists than all the world’s anti-communists combined.The final straw for many was the use of Russian tanks to suppress Hungarian student protesters in 1956.By the 1960s, an honest intellectual could not defend communism either on economic or humanitarian grounds. But as it turned out that there were plenty of intellectuals who thought that something … kinda … sorta … like Marxism was just what west’s culture needed. Intellectuals of theI’m oversimplifying to some extent. Professors of education and humanities didn’t just decide to adopt Neo-Marxist Critical Theory as the oporating system (so to speak) of academia. First they embraced the French philosophy ofAdvocates of Postmodernism, like renegade historianA new philosophy was crafted together based on equal parts mis-understanding of Postmodernism and a piss-poor understanding of Neo-Marxism. While the overriding philosophy is a miss-mash of “postmodernism” and “Neo-Marxism” As it evolved since the turn of the century, the guiding principle becameLook at the diagram above. Everyone will fit into more than one catagory.Within this system of understanding, “knowledge” is given credibility based not on whether is is empirically true, it is based on the extent you are privileged or oppressed.If you mostly fit into categories below the horizontal line, your opinions are given greater weight. It doesn’t matter whether or not your beliefs are based on reality, because there is no real way of knowing; it’s all about power.If you mostly fit into categories above the horizontal line, your opinions are given less weight, even if you’ve compiled lots of facts and data to support your belief. The fact that you rely on “factoids” rather than emotion to make your argument means that you just don’t get it.More so than Postmodernism or Marxism, this is the overriding philosophy at work in American universities. If you have any interest in understanding how these ideas took hold in academia, I would recommend listening to Helen Pluckrose.Ms. Pluckrose is a left-wing critic of Postmodernism and Critical Theory.The real cultural fight on campus was between the advocates of liberalism and old-school socialism and the advocates of intersectionalism and Critical Theory. In this case the Classical Marxists represent the less radical world outlook.Khrushchev may have threatened to bury America……but his hatred for America is a lot less visceral than what is expressed by many of those we charge with educating our young adults, such as college instructor beating a political opponent with a bicycle lock in the photo below.As long as our institutions of higher education embrace philosophies that denegrate logic, reason and the free exchange of ideas, they will be a threat to political discourse.",34 followers,Rick Steele,1.9K,13.3K,12.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-thoughts-on-the-leaked-Operation-Yellowhammer-report-on-the-No-Deal-Brexit

You wouldn’t have modern conservative economics without the University of Chicago. I don’t agree with them but hey, I am not an economist am I?

Universities are small-l liberal because that’s actually an approach that says you have to argue from evidence and submit to peer review and discussion as well as stay in your lane to a certain extent. If you are an electrical engineer you can’t speak as an authority on epidemics for example but you can speak, just be prepared to show evidence on your views.I just experienced this the other night on the problem of reopening schools in NYC. We had three people with advanced degrees in epidemiology from Columbia and CUNY. All published and all recognized as experts. The CCNY professor kept her mouth shut except to ask questions, and they weren’t “gotcha” questions. Why? She’s an expert, but her field is AIDS, not COVID. At the end all of them said let’s listen to the NYC Health Department because they have the experts. This is exactly how higher ed works on the inside. The reason why the Chicago School could upend the Keynes School and co-exist at some places is because they did their homework, not because they “owned the libs.”Sure large C conservatives think they are discriminated against but if you look at the nominee for the Supremes you’ll note she’s a tenured professor and that there’s Federalist Society members all over the damn place. They remained in their lane, published and got tenure and have slowly changed the field. But that’s the point. You have to do the work.The problem I see with many so-called conservatives is that they want to speak from authority and not evidence and they bring a knife to fights where paper is the weapon of choice. You go to a department and say homosexuality is an immoral mental disorder your colleagues might be offended but if you are in an actual psychology department they are going to ask you how you intend to prove it. You come in saying tax cuts lead to growth, well, not so fast. Evidence doesn’t clearly support that. Climate change? Yeah, you better have data, not arguments like “climate changes all the time” or “how does half a degree make a difference.” Problem with the climate change deniers is the people who put forward the climate change theory have been actively studying this for almost half a century and nearly every prediction has hit the mark. The data is all open source at this time too. You deny you better make a case.There’s some discomfort amongst the big C conservatives about student activism and safe spaces and all that, well, get used to it. You can, and do, form your own clubs too and some like to provoke people and get a charge claiming victimhood but as I mentioned before no one gets upset about the nose to the grindstone kids in the Federalist Society. Yes, there are plenty of conservatives at Harvard and even at BMCC where I work.Sometimes I think conservatives thrive on seeing themselves as victims. They call others snowflakes but hey, remember Bari Weiss who drove the Columbia faculty crazy because she ran around claiming left wing abuse? She’s riding that all the way to the bank on lazy scholarship, red baiting and rather dubious arguments and getting paid the whole time, including a cushy job at that so-called liberal fake news bastion the New York Times. She quit as a lucrative career move, not because she was bullied. If you don’t have the facts on your side just yell louder instead of doing your homework.

These folks live their lives as rigid, intellectually immobile and critical of anything outside those rigid limits they have adopted.So, with all that interaction happening, it creates an interesting perception among some people that colleges and universities are hotbeds of “anti-conservative” bias and intentionally “victimizing” young conservatives and attempting to quash their thoughts, ideas, ideals and their values.That victim narrative has spread among conservatives as though it were smokin’ hot Gospel. And yet, I suspect that many of the adherents to these biases blame and vilify universities for not promoting and supporting “conservative viewpoints.”My experience in universities is that they are (and should be) havens of academic freedom, by which I mean ALL ideas — popular and unpopular, current and archaic, revolutionary and ordinary, religious and secular, vaporware and concrete, progressive and reactionary, weird and common — are allowed and encouraged for debate and discussion.This academic freedom is reflective of our American culture in microcosm. We value the right to express our opinions in our country, and the Constitution protects that right, just as it does freedom of the press, religion and so forth. We aggressively resist anyone trying to tell us what to say, what to believe and what to think.That’s why universities are SO necessary as arenas in which all ideas can be aired, be heard, be debated, refuted, contested and either adopted, adapted or rejected without fear or favor. The reality is that not all ideas have equal weight, and many are upset when their ideas, when thrown into such an arena and have few adherents and supporters. There are a few “flat-earthers” who are convinced that their ideas are being marginalized by universities and that they’re being intentionally rejected only because their theories are different from those in the mainstream.So, we need colleges and universities to actually BE that markeplace of ideas where we can have our dearest and most closely held assumptions challenged by others and examined by ourselves, thereby broadening our horizons and widening our experiences with the world at large. We need such experiences to help us to learn about what makes others (and ourselves) tick and through that, become the best versions of ourselves that we can be.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

You can argue bully's and people who spread xenophobia are shut down. So it’s not for all.

Yes that’s a kind of diversity threat but if you don’t shut things like that down the university can’t accommodate diversity like people of other religions, females, people of different skin colors, people who have an different sexual preference etc etc.I find universities for only Christian students, for Jews, for whites, for Democrats, for women etc etc very sad an surly lacking diversity.Another group who are shut down is conspiracy theorist and those who prefer alternative facts. We all know universities are meant to teach people facts and social tested theories …right All schools are meant to teach facts so there are answers you can’t argue with. That’s the only way to gain knowledge, one semester build upon an other. Then it makes sense.Right now there are a lot of people who prefers their primary news media to be alternative like Fox etc. How do we know they promote conspiracy theories and fake news? Critical thinking makes us validate what we are reading, checking the facts. There are objective news out there. When in doubt check with allied objective news. English news have a reputation to be objective.The political climate today are difficult . The Republican has followed Trump into the extremist ideas. Trump has followed the pattern of other authoritarian leaders, they don’t like higher education, because educated people fact check more often. They prefer to attack science and universities. There is a lot of very bright people in the Republican Party so I’m sure they will regain their footing soon and become a serious political party again. The Republican Party functions best as a Conservative party not an extremist party.When two parties keep to the facts debates can go on as normal on universities. When one side debates with misinformation it’s no point in debates. Bias is good. Misinformation and lies are not.You can also argue that people who can’t afford to take higher education is a treat to diversity. I totally agree. There are smart people, too poor their potential are waisted. The country needs all the smart people in the future. Free higher education would ensures all the smartest gets a chance.Another groups not represent are those who can’t get excepted, those who have other interests etc. All groups will never be at an university so bullies, xenophobias, people who prefer alternative facts etc are just another group who really don’t belong there in the first place.If you have been and got thrown out because of xenophobia or misinformation it’s probably because you got to extreme, not managing to hide these theories. University is also a very good place to meet diversity, people you never thought you had anything in common with. Learning complexity on all levels teach us a lot about these things. What we learn from the people around us growing up might be very different from what experiences at universities teach us.",UNKNOWN,Prophet Kendrick O.,1.8K,862,16.1M,https://www.quora.com/After-viewing-Emma-Watsons-HeForShe-speech-what-do-men-feel-about-the-feminism-movement
