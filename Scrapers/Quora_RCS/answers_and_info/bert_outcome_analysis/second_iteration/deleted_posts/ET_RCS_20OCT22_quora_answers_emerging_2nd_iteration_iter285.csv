Since all nuclear bombs function through critical mass (the most of a substance that can exist in a single lump without explosively decaying), there simply isn't enough of the nuclear substance left to achieve it, and thus explode. I imagine this takes much longer than the previous though, since those half-lives are generally quite long.","3,964 followers",Rafael Cavacchini,9.5K,427,8.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-a-nuclear-weapon-as-it-ages

3,It is not only possible but has been quite common. There are degrees of failure from nothing happening to the much more common nuclear fizzle in which the device is destroyed as a result of the assembly of the fissile material failing to be correctly or timely accomplished. Such might result in a lower than designed yield or just a radiaoactive mess. “Buster Able” was the most embarrasing for the Americans with a nuclear yield estimated to be one pound of TNT.

Thus, we have test shot Starfish Prime.Starfish Prime detonation as seen through clouds from Honolulu, 900 miles away from launch site. That’s not the Sun—it’s 11 pm.Starfish Prime was part of Operation Fishbowl, a series of high-altitude nuclear tests in 1962. The US had previously done several tests involving nuclear weapons detonated about 50 miles above the Earth, but these tests had been performed hastily. They had demonstrated a lot of curious effects—for instance, people at a corresponding spot on the opposite side of the equator would instantly see huge, vivid auroras—but they hadn’t done a good job of capturing the effects with instruments and they hadn’t experimented with different altitudes. Some of the shots had also used very small nuclear weapons. And perhaps most importantly, they had noticed that the electromagnetic pulses that interfered with radios were different in these high-altitude detonations, but they needed more data to understand them.So the military decided to perform a series of more carefully-designed, better-instrumented experiments with larger weapons at different altitudes. Well,The original Fishbowl plan was to perform three tests:The planners anticipated that some of the test attempts would fail, so they decided that the first shot would have the codename, the second would have the codename followed by “Prime”, the third would use “Double Prime”, and so on.The military did their building and planning and, only six months behind schedule, they had a Thor rocket and a nuclear warhead on the launch pad for test shot Bluegill. They ignited the rocket just after midnight, started watching it ascend, and…it vanished. The rocket was still flying, but it had disappeared from their radar tracking screens. Although its trajectory had been correct, there was no way to know if it was off course and going to fly into some of the many ships and aircraft full of instruments to monitor the test, so the range safety officer sent it a self-destruct command.Undaunted, the military moved on to Starfish. They rolled out another rocket two weeks later, strapped a W-49 warhead to it, and ignited it. The rocket flew perfectly for 59 seconds, then the engine stopped, the rocket began to break apart, and the range safety officer sent it a self-destruct command. The rocket exploded about six miles aboveground, spreading charred pieces of rocket—some of them radioactive—across Johnston Island and the surrounding ocean.Still not getting the hint, the military moved on to Starfish Prime. Three weeks after the first Starfish, they brought out another rocket and W-49 and, in the middle of the night, lit the fuse. This time the rocket performed perfectly, arcing 375 miles above the Earth, then descending to 250 miles before detonating its 1.4 megaton warhead.The immediate effect was aThe detonation also quickly created intense auroras, illuminating thousands of miles of ocean from the test site to the Samoan Islands. But the most serious effect was that it created a dangerous radiation belt around the Earth which persisted for months after the test. Satellites passing through the belt were seriously damaged; two Navy navigation satellites, three research satellites from the US, UK, and USSR, and the first communications satellite to transmit live TV across an ocean were all lost to it.The military took one look at test shot Urraca, which was planned to detonate at an altitude with many more satellites, and said “nope”. But they kept trying with Bluegill, and Bluegill Prime succeeded in exploding on the launch pad, destroying the facility and once again spreading radioactive debris across the island.While the military spent three months cleaning up the mess, they re-planned Fishbowl, downsizing Bluegill’s warhead and adding three relatively small-yield, relatively low-altitude tests to achieve a more manageable electromagnetic pulse. Bluegill Double Prime once again managed to shower Johnston Island with debris, but BluegillThe Soviets ran their own series of high-altitude tests, this time over Kazakhstan; one of their tests produced a similarly gigantic EMP, which fried about a thousand miles of telephone and power lines and caused a fire that burned down a power plant. Around this time, the US and Soviet Union finally realized that aboveground nuclear tests were aSo, the answer to your question is: A nuclear bomb detonated in space doesn’t create a shock wave; instead, it creates a ton of radiation and some high-speed, particle-scale radioactive debris. There is no mushroom cloud—the blast is spherical and continues to visibly glow for many minutes.If the detonation is near a planet with a magnetic field and atmosphere, it interacts with them to create auroras, radiation belts that cook satellites for months, and a huge electromagnetic pulse that would probably fry a nation’s electrical grid and everything attached to it. If there are people on that planet, they might feel the heat of the blast on their faces; if those people aren’t wearing protective goggles, they might slowly regain some of their eyesight over the next six months. However, very little radiation reaches the ground.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-a-nuclear-weapon-as-it-ages

If you're a stellar-mass object, gravity will create significant enough heat and pressure that fusion becomes a naturally occurring process. Here on Earth, to make power with fusion, we have to turn a chunk of atmosphere into a simulated star and then try to extract more energy than was used to create the conditions for fusion. Making those conditions is hard (so takes lots of energy). And extracting energy is inefficient (it's a multistage process to turn the particle kinetic energy coming out of fusion into useable heat to drive a turbine to make electrical energy, so most of the energy produced by the reaction gets lost as waste). So until we figure out an easier way to make an unstable mini-star and/or figure out a more effective way to turn hard radiation into electricity, the process is not a useable direct power source.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-a-nuclear-weapon-as-it-ages

Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s for a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.). Sadly, there has been frustratingly little payoff for all this MCF pure fusion effort as never once in over six decades of effort has any MCF fusion experiment produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds).MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power. ICF fusion worked and produced net energy from fusion from the very first experimental ICF fusion test (Ivy-Mike 1952).Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote equivalent funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). Halite-Centurion series underground test shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the underground test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed remotely some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has beenIf the public was comfortable in producing fusion energy in a succession of short fusion “bursts” instead of in a smooth continuous fusion burn; providing funding and committing National Lab design resources in a way comparable to MCF research, we could have with very low technical risk reliable ICF fusion power plants in a time frame that matters (proof of principal within 5 years - commercial ICF power plants in 10 years).","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-a-nuclear-weapon-as-it-ages
