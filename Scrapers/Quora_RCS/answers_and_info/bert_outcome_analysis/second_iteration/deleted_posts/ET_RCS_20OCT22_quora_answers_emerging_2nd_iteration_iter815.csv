Technically speaking this refers to a closed timelike curve, which describes the trajectory of a particle on a 4-dimensional manifold (i.e., its worldline through spacetime) and saying that it creates a loop in time.

Technically speaking this refers to a closed timelike curve, which describes the trajectory of a particle on a 4-dimensional manifold (i.e., its worldline through spacetime) and saying that it creates a loop in time. You can talk about the usual objections of time travel, like the grandfather paradox, but this is avoided when imposing [causal] consistency. In quantum mechanical terms, it means that the evolution operator must produce the initial state again at the end of the time loop (and operators that don't are illegal).It turns out that any computer augmented with time-travelling capabilities are able to solveIn terms of complexity theory, time and space are two important resources that differ in one clear way: space is a reusable resource and sometimes you can get away with not needing a lot of it, but time can only be used once. Clearly the situation changes if we postulate the existence of time travel. Figuring out exactly how these resources help (or hurt) computational efficiency is an important problem in theoretical CS research, so although it seems a little funny to be investigating these kinds of far-out ideas, it might turn out to give us new insight into the theoretical power of computers in our universe.Further reading:","29,948 followers",Senia Sheydvasser,861,2.3K,28.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-processor-could-process-faster-than-the-speed-of-light

Instead as soon as a task was given to the processor the answer was received. The engineers even got away with shoddy construction. If you think about it the conventional issues such as energy requirements and heat etc would be moot. The processor would never be in use other than the basic task of receiving the information and maybe sending the data (as one assumes the information is received immediately after the data is sent) thus it would use minimal energy and produce no heat etc. Time travel itself relates more to timelines, probability and paradoxes. In that all potential timelines appear to erase themselves instead of overlapping in forward motion i.e. one can not observe any changes after the start point. Using loop techniques like in normal programming one could even suggest that even if the processors burn out in one timeline then all that needs to happen is that the problem is retried in another timeline thus the answers can still be obtained even if the processors are incapable of processing it regardless of time. I.e. breaking a complex problem into smaller easier problems.",2 followers,Richard Muller,7.3K,2.3K,202M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-processor-could-process-faster-than-the-speed-of-light
2,"Well let us first define processing something faster than speed of light? Because speed of light is a velocity, whereas processing speed for information is the time it takes to go through a certain bit of information. The two are not related.What you could be asking is, is it possible for the transfer of bits from one place to other to exceed the speed of light. To that my answer would be no. Transfer of bits/information is restricted by the speed of light, as even the fastest medium of transfer is, the speed of light.",48 followers,Ryan Murphy,11.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-processor-could-process-faster-than-the-speed-of-light

But I think I know what you are asking, and I can paraphrase as follows:So, what *would* happen if our brains could operate at those speeds? I think that’s a really fun question.First, we could think really, really fast – on the order of millions of times faster than we do now. We could easily outsmart any other creature on the planet that didn’t have this type of brain. And we would have lots of time to consider the best action to take in an emergency. Let’s suppose you only have a second to make a life-or-death decision. Assuming a conservative speedup of a million to one, that second would give you time for a week and a half of continuous analysis devoted to selecting your next move.So that would definitely be a survival advantage. But it would be a horrible way to live. You’d be so bored all the time that you’d probably negate the survival advantage by killing yourself. Which could be a painful process, as your brain would experience the dying process for at least a year before shutting down.It gets worse. Your body would still be operating at the same speed as it does now, so your brain would have a *lot* of extra time on its hands. Let’s say you live in Silicon Valley and it takes you an hour to drive to work. What would you think about all that time? As far as your brain is concerned, that hour-long, stop-and-go drive would take 114 years, with no time off for sleep. You see what I mean about boring? And that’s a relatively short interval. If you were a kid wishing you could grow up a little faster and get out into the world (bad call, kids), getting through a single year would require your brain to wait the equivalent of 27 centuries.But then, another factor would intervene to prevent any of this from being an issue. Your brain is only 5% of your body weight, but it sucks up 20% of your available energy. If you need, say, 2000 calories a day, your brain requires 400 of those calories. Using that million-to-one ratio again, you’d have to consume 400 million calories a day just to power your brain. Sorry, but not even a teenager can wolf down calories at that rate. So you’d be brain dead in a split second. Not much time to enjoy your new superbrain.",2 followers,Richard Muller,21.6K,2.3K,202M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-processor-could-process-faster-than-the-speed-of-light

Nearly all the images would be totally unintelligible, only a minuscule number of them would have any meaningful patterns perceivable by human eye3. Since the set has every possible image (in a 256 x 256 frame) It will have every possible 'future' and every wrong equation, there's pretty much no way to sift through the data.4.

Kids' favorite animations were shown as part of the activities.These are the emotions from students' experiences...The pleasant memories of going on a trip with parents.The anger one student had in the morning was because he had a fight with his brother on the way to school.The fear another student felt while waiting for his mother from work late at night.Children were honest about their feelings. The children welcomed me with enthusiasm and treated me with all their sincerity. I rather gained courage from them.Students wearing masks raising their little fists to make a presentation reminded me that I was the mother of small, young children just seven years ago.As a parent of two sons, now 14 and 15, these kids seemed too small and fragile. During the two-hour class, there were some kids who spoke logically. Some kids got up from their chairs and wandered around because they couldn't focus. There was a child who stuttered a lot. Some kids liked to talk about how they felt, while others sat silently.In my eyes, they all looked like small, frail children. Then I remembered. My two sons were the same age as the kids I just met, so it reminded me of their childhood. It was just me and a bunch of parents observing open class, not today as a teacher.At the time, I thought my son lacked a lot of skills. My worry was putting pressure on my son, so he couldn't even do a presentation and couldn't focus in class. The kids, except for my son, all seemed to present well and got good grades because of this kind of mind. Through the sunglasses of inferiority consciousness, I was looking at my son and the world.I had a long-lived bad habit before I got married. I liked to stand out from the crowd.It was unbearable for me if I didn't show myself with a polished appearance, excellent work skills, and pleasant conversation skills. At the university cafeteria, I felt relieved to be surrounded by male students from the same major.With such a fragile heart, as a housewife, I suffered shame for unknown reasons and repeated the act of comparing myself to others countless times.It's through meditation that I'm freed from the evil mind of shame and inferiority. The meditation I learned made me realize these minds are fake and I've made them myself. I've lived in my head. The guide helped me get rid of it. Not only have I been freed from this mind through meditation, but I also wanted to share my experience of success with others like me. That's why I met students through the class.Gradually, the feelings of shame, inferiority, and comparison melted away. I also gained the wisdom to help me see life more clearly.When he came home from school, my oldest son told me something I'll never forget.""Mom, you're 40, aren't you? You think you're old, don't you? But compared to the age of the universe, you're a baby. We're all babies compared to the universe.""When I don't have a false mind, I seem more humble.",3 followers,Gaurav Vicky,3.1K,55,1M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

Later, we entered the temples.I was taken aback by the impeccable beauty of the masterpiece. It left me flabbergasted. I could not believe.The temple is really very beautiful. It is best of its kind. It consists of 5 temple buildings in total. All are named differently.It is mainly made up of the white marble. Its carvings and skilled work on the wall and roof are incomparable, even with Taj Mahal.But wait, Real mind blow is still to come. Some people were talking inside the temple. We heard them saying the Temple was made around 11th century.Wait What!!!How?It was not possible to make such a divinely piece of art and craft back then.Later, I returned and googled the fact about the temple. It was made in between 11th and 13th century by Vimal Shah and designed by Vastupal-Tejpal.Now, I consider it better than Taj Mahal. Only thing which is better in Taj Mahal than this masterpiece is height. Otherwise considering the time when it was made, It is still the best piece of carvings on marble. I am adding some photos taken from Google as we were not allowed to carry our mobiles inside the temple.See the skilled and subtle work.experience the majestic roof.Please guys, do visit this place.And what made me sad later was the fact that we were never told in school about such masterpiece of unparalleled skill. It may be present in some of our books, I don’t know, but still most of the Indians Don’t know this place.Thanks and forgive for erratic English.Sources:THANKS",101 followers,Mani Katiyar,3.3K,63,322.6K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

Each person believes they know what a beetle is, but it’s purely based on what’s in their own box.Now, it’s certainly possible that each person has something unique in their box, or even that the thing constantly changes.

The box could even be empty!-So, here’s a question: what reallyYou might be quick to say: “Well it’s a type of bug, obviously!” If you’re feeling especially technical, you might add: “It’s of the orderBut in our scenario, the word “beetle” could really mean anything. Each person has their own understanding of what a beetle really is, and it’s purely dependent on what they have in their own box.In this world, the only true meaning to the word “beetle” is “the thing that’s in your box.”-This analogy was initially devised by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. For him, each box is like an individual’s mind, with the “beetle” representing the experiences and sensations within.And just like how no one can look into anyone else’s box but their own, no one can know exactly what it is like to be another person or to experience things from their point of view.However, we generally assume that everyone’s mind works about the same way. We assume that every person experiences physical and emotional sensations the same way, but we don’t truly know what they’re experiencing.Everyone only knows about the beetle in their own box.-Wittgenstein’s analogy was meant to explain something known as the “private language argument.”Why is it that people relate the term “beetle” to a kind of bug? Well, one likely answer is that they were taught that way in school. Or, maybe they just picked it up through reading books, or from talking to people.But the general idea is that their understanding of “beetle,” and its place in language, came from the outside world.It’sWittgenstein believed that having a language to describe one’s own private experiences is impossible. One cannot really describe their private experiences, because the language they employ to do so is based on public usage.Put simply, a “private” language can never exist.-The fact is, everyone has their own experiences and sensations. They have their own way of perceiving the world around them.They each have their own beetle in a box.But, the language we use may not truly describe that beetle. After all, we’re trying to describe subjective experiences through objective terms.The mind-blowing reality is that, as it currently stands, we can never truly communicate our private experiences to one another.Yet, in spite of that, we’ve managed to develop concrete systems of language that enable us to overcome that barrier, at least to an extent.If that isn’t a mind-blowing feat, I don’t know what is.","3,067 followers",Nishanth Jayram,1.9K,52,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

But in the 1880s, aHistory of the temple :Col. Martin was in the Afghan wars. He used to regularly write to his wife, informing her of conditions there. It was a long war, and gradually the colonel’s letters stopped. Mrs. Martin, who then lived in the cantonment of Agar Malwa, was besides herself with grief, fearing the worst.She would spend time riding for hours to calm herself. One day she rode her horse, past the temple of Baijnath Mahadev. It was in a decrepit state. It was the time of arti, and the sound of conches and the chanting of mantras compelled her to stop. She went inside to see the worship of Lord Shiva taking place. The priests saw the grief on her face and asked her what was wrong. Mrs. Martin narrated her sad story. The Brahmins told her that Lord Shiva listens to sincere prayers of all devotees and saves them from difficult situations. She was advised by one of the priests to start chanting the mantra: “Om Namah Shivaya” for 11 days. The Englishwoman prayed to Lord Shiva for the colonel’s safe return, promising she would rebuild the temple if he came home safe from the war.On the 10th day, a messenger arrived from Afghanistan with a letter from her husband. It read, “I was regularly sending you letters from the battlefield but then suddenly the Pathans surrounded us. I thought there was no way of escape. Suddenly I saw an Indian yogi with long hair, wearing a tiger skin carrying a trident. He had an awe-inspiring personality and he started wielding his weapon against the Afghans who ran away from the field in fright. With his grace what was certain death our bad times turned into victory. Then the great yogi told me that I should not worry and that he had come to rescue me because he was very pleased with my wife’s prayers.”Tears of joy and gratitude welled up in Mrs. Martin’s eyes as she read the letter. Her heart was overwhelmed. She fell at the feet of Lord Shiva’s image and sobbed. After a few weeks Lt. Col. Martin returned and his wife told him her story. The couple became devotees of Lord Shiva. In 1883, they donated Rs 15,000 to renovate the temple. This information is engraved on a slab kept in the Baijnath Mahadev Temple.The Martins sailed for England with the firm resolution that they would make a Shiva temple at their home and pray to him till the end of life. And they did.I tried to find alternate history of the temple but couldn't find any.

Major differences of Opinion will Destroy a Marriage and communications are key to a good marriage.Most major marital differences cannot be resolved and almost 70% of major arguments involve perpetual and unresolvable problems. Couples spend years and untoldHere’s one generally accepted idea that has no basis in fact and has been proven untrue but is still believed, even by some professionals:l. Major differences of Opinion will Destroy a Marriage and communications are key to a good marriage.Most major marital differences cannot be resolved and almost 70% of major arguments involve perpetual and unresolvable problems. Couples spend years and untold energy trying to resolve problems for which there is no solution, except divorce. They try to change each other in which communications are the problem, not the solution. Rather than accept the partner as being of a different political or religious persuasion they are determined to change them. Successful couples learn to accept the other, just the way they are and learn that it’s all right to agree to disagree. Sharing dreams and hopes is more important than that they agree on everything.2. We are biologically unprepared, even after millions of years of survival, for the number of choices we face in the modern world. It’s called the paradox of choice. People worry over available choices and that once a decision is made they might have chosen differently.Psychologist Barry Schwartz has demonstrated that the assumption that greater choice makes us feel better,which supposedly gives us more power is false. When offered less choice we seem to be more satisfied with what we are given. Repeated tests have show that people are more satisfied when they have less choice, even when the quality is not as good.One example is when two groups of students are offered separate boxes of chocolates. The smaller box contains six chocolates of lesser quality than students given a box of thirty chocolates of high quality. Students invariably picked the smaller box in repeated tests. Paradoxically, happiness may lie in limiting our array of choices, rather than increasing them. With all the advances in income, labor saving devices, gadgets and higher standard of living, people are no happier than before all the prosperity and choices now offered modern consumers.3. For most of the history of psychology it has been assumed and postulated that an individual’s past determines his future happiness. Self-help movements have followed the feel-good movements such as nurturing the “inner child,” to the rebirthing movement and others, based on the Freudian assumption that parenting equals all. Research doesn’t support this notion, in fact disproves it.For example, someone under the age of 11 whose mother dies has only a slightly higher risk for depression later in life but the risk is only slight and only if they are female and even then, depression shows up in only half the studies. Furthermore, parental divorce has only a marginally disruptive effect on later childhood and adolescence which wanes in later life.Adult depression, anxiety, addictions, bad marriage, or anger—none of these can be blamed for what happened to us as a child. What matters is development of personal strengths that don’t depend on the quality of childhood experiences or current circumstances.4. Conventional wisdom about moods is that they are caused by stress, thoughts or our reaction to particular events or pieces of information. A success can put us in a good mood a failure can put us in a bad mood.In general, moods are related in a very real sense to how generally healthy we are, our sleeping patterns, quality of nutrition, and whether or not we exercise. Those who take care of themselves are less moody and...",UNKNOWN,Mike E. King,1.8K,26.6K,51.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

Imagine how mutually painful that is; how hard it is to communicate basic needs and feelings to each other.I figured this would lead to some kind of resolution or at least mutual understanding, but even twelve years after our breakupAbout a year after we’d separated and she had been dating someone else for about a year, I began casually dating. We worked together at the time and my ex began to make fun of me in front of customers, belittle my choices to the staff, and call me “stupid.” She began a public campaign to vilify me, informing people that they had to take sides.Soon, strangers use me as a meme when they think about abuse they’ve suffered themselves.For all that I know, this person doesn’t know me, has never met me, and yet believes that bullying a stranger is constructive behavior.My ex took textbook symptoms of my autism to say that I “deserve” my health problems and the outcomes of my social disability:The same publication is littered with statements of what I think and believe; things that only I could know for certain. I understand that the symptoms of autism can be taxing and difficult and painful and I respect that pain. But does hardship mean that I deserve to hurt and suffer too? Does anyone?Starting about five years after I was divorced,Before I understood the emotional needs of others, I was repeatedly insensitive and callous towards their feelings, hurting people that felt close to me in deep, fundamental ways. I took no pleasure in this. I was confused each time that it happened and ultimately it hurt me too; I cared about these people and wanted emotional proximity with them but had no understanding of how to achieve that. Still, my actions that hurt them. I emotionally abused people that I care about. Taking responsibility for the impact of my actions was the first step towards moving on. I focused on learning how to prevent it from continuing.I do believe that her pain is real and that these efforts are trying to heal the pain. I’ve had twelve to years to read about neuroscience and discovered that the brain holds onto feelings instead of details. These form our experiences which form our reality. Feelings aren’t healed by following a series of semantic demands. Following directions, even for years, can never alone resolve the hurt that has now been shared one-thousand fold.It’s hard to help someone who​ ​in pain. So instead I’ve watched person after person manifest that empathy by trying to harm someone. I’ve​ seen this pattern play out on both sides of many situations. But we don’t look at the longterm consequences of these actions and that mentality isn’t doingWhen I finally got out of that relationship, I was so embarrassed about the way that I had allowed myself to be treated (and later when I realized how my actions felt and were interpreted) that I sought refuge. I felt terrorized and was losing my mind. I was too ashamed to face many of the people who had been so loyal to me for so many years. So I went into my shell, moved across the county, and allowed my ex to dominate my narrative, just as I had allowed her to dictate the terms of our divorce. And soon she was literally pushing through my boundaries and dictating my motives, denying my perspective, and telling me what I believe. And gradually, she overwrote my perspective. For years, I adopted her perspective on my life without questioning.From the first time my actions were referred to as “abusive,” every action and statement I take has been filtered through a critical lens of scrutiny. My words and actions were twisted and manipulated, no matter how seemingly innocuous or trying to protect myself, into some form of abusive behavior. When I tried to defend myself, that was interpreted as denying the other party’s feelings. When I apologize, it’s interpreted as insincere and trying to manipulate the situation and regain control. If I wasn’t so utterly terrified to go on the offensive, that would obviously be interpreted as proving andMy ex-wife and I have no contact but she uses vague allegations to demand that people stop supporting my work or even being my friend. My ex and other people began to dictate what I was thinking, feeling, and the corresponding morality of that. When people ask for more information or specifics, she insists that they are ""enabling abuse.""This has resulted in many people strangers resounding these statements:And my ex’s resulting glee:After four years, my ex eventually bullied one of our more prominent authors, Cindy Crabb, into taking a stand against us. It was a hard place for Crabb, sandwiched between being called a hypocrite and a publishing contract that she described as being better than she could find elsewhere. She also admitted that she hadn’t had the problems with us that my ex accused us of, though naturally ignoring nuance and becoming demanding and difficult made the situation worse instead of better:We did everything that was asked of us on the requested schedule but she somehow still decided that it was “too little, too late.” Her comments came to be seen as a bellwether of the community.The thing about a boycott is that it requires an “ask.” Like, “We need you to do this or we are withdrawing support.” I cooperated with 20 demands that my ex sent to me in a letter. I cooperated with a mediation group (who promptly disappeared). I cooperated with an accountability process who sent me busy work and then told me that they were too busy, closing with ""It ended because it was too much to deal with over the internet, not because it had been completed."" And despite my cooperation, it was written that the lack of resolution was solely my fault. The resulting weight of this unresolvable situation caused at least ten different co-workers to quit, including me.And then hyperbole just ran wild:WhenAs well as to suggest to people to contact event organizers and have me removed:I was summarily uninvited from dozens of events across the world.She frames the events of my life in relation to her and accuses me of things that I’ve never done, like going by her house, throwing a steak on her porch, or leaving things at her business:People began telling me to kill myself and claiming that I had done things like rape that I wasn’t even accused of. The people attacking me were emotionally abusive in the name of…ending emotional abuse:Or having bold claims of hyperbole without fact checking or looking at brass tacks:I am autistic. So rules are important to me. If you used the rules of journalism and fact-checking, you wouldBut online bullying isn’t about resolution. It’s about the power to destroy things. Even the person who tells people to “End” me is celebrated and cheered on by their peers:And when I wrote a book about growing up autistic and learning from it, my ex-wife took it as…being about her:When I join a neutral discussion group, she pushed strangers to demean me and demand that I be kicked out, this time using her boyfriend as a proxy:While researching a new edition of one of my books, a strange Facebook account appeared that used a picture I was in and a variation on my name. It began bullying me and the people that I love, calling them enablers and accusing me of terrible things, telling me what I believed, and insisting on what I had and hadn’t done. Funny thing though, the person imitating me didn’t even know what I look like. While they used a photo containing me, they cropped it around the face of my friend Sheldon, a kid who grew up in South Africa, has been through no shortage of shit, and looks nothing like me. Obviously, such a bully does not respond to logic, does not care what happens to me, and operates on some kind of moral high ground because of their apparent didactic politics.And sent this message to my girlfriend of eight years:My ex pretended to file a restraining order against me and hired a courier to deliver it. It lacked a judge's signature because there was nothing to suggest that I'd ever stalked or harassed her. Still, it entered the cannon that she had taken “legal action” against me. Then, after we'd had no contact in over a decade, she shows up to attend my book reading event and leaves this note for me to find:She claims that *I* have a strange need to control the narrative about my lifeWhen my former business partners left and started their own business, she took a stand against and made vague demands of them:But when my former business partners relented and issued a statement in support of her, my ex relented as well and began supporting them:I've spent a dozen years going out of my way to try and create healing and closure and it really seems like that's not wanted. It really messed with my head and it's still exhausting.At the same time, while everyone who works with me is bullied about this on the Internet on a near-daily basis, we rarelySince I’m autistic, after spending years of my life learning normative behaviors of neurotypicals, it’s even weirder and more perplexing that this behavior is considered acceptable and even encouraged. Strangers andA recent review that is largely sympathetic to my story and nuanced in the writer’s views of the situation still manage to conflate autism with sociopathy, a particularly common misunderstanding:Gave me a sense of how difficult it might be to trust this guy with my feelings…If you know that someone’s doctor gave them a ‘How to be Caring’ checklist, then how can you ever be sure that they aren’t just checking boxes when they do something nice?Just a few weeks ago when a friend wrote about how words like gaslighting were overused inappropriately beyond their actual meaning, someone claimed to have seen me stalking my ex-wife, something that is actually a clearly defined crime. And after reading the law, something that I have never done. The irony, of course, is that my ex’s actions do qualify as online stalking, which is against the law in Oregon.The more that I’ve cooperated and done what was asked of me, the more that it becomes apparent that resolution isn’t the goal. Still, I think the best solution is resolution; making peace. Throwing around more bullying isn’t helping anything. I’ve tried to take the high road all along.The strangest thing is that, at some point, I became the touch stone whenever someone in a certain sphere wanted to reference abuse:It toughens up my skin but the fact that this kind of behavior can be made normal on the Internet (and I have no idea what this person’s identity is) is REALLY WEIRD.Update:TLDR: “We are removing you from our website because people complained that we were supporting you. We didn’t bother to ask for information or even your side of the story. It’s easier to just do what the bullies want.” Can you blame him?Update Two:Update Three:Despite my hesitation, after many, many people have asked me to take donations to pay for the creation of a Protective Order, I have relented. I set this up for donations:And in closing, more peculiar examples of all of this nonsense:And “funniest” of all, the same person trolling me on Quora has contacted my work about this post.

Doesn’t that mean that everybody who lives in the southern hemisphere should fall off the world?-“Since gravity doesn’t exist, what pulls us down then?”, you ask.-Let’s now assume that the round earth model was somehow true. We are on a giant ball of matter, whizzing through space at incredible speeds, and spinning at speeds well over 1000 miles per hour (1600 km/h). Does that sound dodgy to you? If that were the case, why am I not flying off the earth? My feet feel very solid on the ground. The earth, therefore, has to be stationary and flat.Guess what?Oh, and look at the image above again! Notice how the horizon is straight and not curved!

There is an ice wall, more commonly known as Antarctica, surrounding it.Governments around the world are refusing us entry into the ice wall. We are not allowed to go past the ice wall for unknown reasons.

Previously we always added another dimension by taking the previous object (black) twice and adding new lines (red) connecting each corner. To understand the resulting concept of the 4th dimension, we need to imagine one single element of the 4th dimension. If one element of the 1st dimension is a dot, an element of the 2nd dimension is a line, an element of the 3rd dimension is a plane that means one element of the 4th dimension is space.Very confusing, but if we imagine the 4th dimension being time, everything starts to make sense. One element of the 4th dimension is exactly one moment in the universe. Meaning that the universe in its current state is one of infinite elements of the 4th dimension. If every moment was part of a line this line would represent the history and future of our universe.It goes even further, we can add another dimension. The 4th dimension as a whole is the history of a whole universe, the 5th dimension as a whole is every possible history of the universe. That means it contains every possible outcome for every event in the history of the universe. Adolf Hitler winning the war, the dinosaurs never being extinct by an asteroid and so on.If we add another dimension it gets beyond human comprehension. It means not only every possible universe, but every possible concept of physical constants. If we go further, we get every possible concept of logical and physical laws. We go even further and we get every possible concept of existence itself.Keep in mind this is a model for understanding a concept. It's not how it really looks like or works, it's a way to understand. If you ask how our universe started to exist and what the first of all events was, you know that time is just one dimension of many. Our understanding of time is that one thing happens after the other. Physics tell us that time and cause are just purely concepts of our minds. We happen to live in a universe with physical laws that allow consciousness to exist and travel along the 4th dimensional ""line"". We are just seeing one moment after the other, in fact the history of our universe just exists, not in a particular order. It's a line, the line always exists, it goes infinitely into the future and past. There is no first or last, it is like written in a book that has never been written, we are reading it, but how you read it or where you start depends on who is reading it.The real question is not why anything exists, but if anything does not exist!PSReally thankful to the one who have published this amazing article on multidimensions in 9gag site :)Easy way to understand the concept of dimensions and how the universe even started to exist",0 followers,Sribalaji,803,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

In the unlikely case that this spermatozoid is the one to fecundate the egg, the organism developed will carry the viral genome in all of its cells.While it is unclear how those viral parts (called Endogenous Retroviruses, ERVs) became fixed to our DNA, the most accepted theory is that retroviruses infected our evolutionary ancestors, and evolution brought them to ourHowever, these viral genetic segments, albeit of signicant proportion in the genome, comprising 5%-8% of it, are now mostly defective, permeated by mutations which make them harmless.Now, if you think this is kinda cool, prepare to have your mind blown…Have you ever heard about the 1% difference between the human genome and the chimpanzee genome? If so, have you wondered, if those genomes are so alike, why are we so different from apes?One of the reasons for that is the difference in some of the regulatory regions of the genome. Much of the genetic material (in many species) is not actively coding, they are there just to control the expression of other parts. In other words, although having 99% identical DNA, humans have regulatory mechanisms, that modulate the expression of the genetic material, in a lifelong process that starts in the embryo, making us different from chimpanzees.And guess what? Among the regulatory regions that are likely responsible for that, many of the are ERVs. That’s right, the viral parts that penetrated into ours ancestors thousands of years ago.Conclusion: The human DNA segments that were once parts of viruses have probably played an important role in human evolution.PS: I’m not sure if this is the BIGGEST MINDFUCK EVER, but it certainly was a big one for me.

However, they claimed that certain squares were a different shade of green.

Basically, it was a specific type of ice age when not only did the polar caps and glaciers around the world expand, but deserts did too, due to the atmosphere effectively having moisture sucked out of it by the ice.The atmosphere became very dry right across the world, but from our perspective, this affected significant parts of central, eastern and southeastern Africa where, at the time, all known humans lived. It’s estimated that the human population at this time could have dropped down to under 1,000 people.The second near-extinction event was around 70,000 years ago following the eruption of a Sumatran volcano called Toba. Rather, it wasn’t just an eruption but it was a super-eruption, where so much ash and gasses are thrown into the atmosphere that their environmental effects threaten life.It’s estimated that the Toba super-eruption ejected roughly 10,000 times more ash and gas than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption did and was big enough to significantly dim the sun globally for up to 6 years, resulting in worldwide cooling and a massive dying of vegetation from both cold and poor light. This again brought the human population down, perhaps to somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 people.This was also the time that early humans began their migration out of Africa and around the world, it’s believed because once the ecosystem had stabilised following the eruption a ‘green corridor’ right the way up the east side of Africa and along the Nile Valley opened up, enabling our ancient ancestors to cross what had formerly been an impassable desert.",UNKNOWN,Ian,4.5K,13.2K,17.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-processor-could-process-faster-than-the-speed-of-light

It introduces macguffins (the rings) that reach out to yet more great mysteries and strange powers, in ways that positively reek of Marvel’s expansive cosmic comics reservoir.

What’s weird is that I’ve been on the forefront of people saying, “You know you can love Trek and Star Wars at the same time?” And yet, I fell totally out of love with Trek to the point where I can barely sit through it (though the animated show still amuses) and found myself equally engrossed with Star Wars.One of the things that shifted was my dislike of everything Marvel. It isn’t that I don’t like superhero shit, it’s just that I’m not sure how many more times I can watch super powered beings shoot zappy-doos at each other while punching so hard that the fabric of space-time ruptures. I want to see a movie where the superhero SOLVES some problem.This is why I started liking “WandaVision” so much and even until the very end, it held up. When the magic zappies started, I got annoyed but at least Wanda actually SOLVED a problem in the end, innovated and used a trick to win. Sure, zappy things happened, but the show put her brains on full display. I appreciated that.There is this scene in the “The Eternals” trailer where the blocky alien ship slowly pulls over the horizon. That was LITERALLY the second time in all the MCU, (the first being Cap + Mjolnir) where I felt the epic emotions about something grand, powerful and harrowing to come. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, until someone I know said, “Huh, Denis Villeneuve could’ve filmed that” then it clicked. This felt real, Godlike and grand in scope.I mean, look, it’s just a trailer. The movie could well be awful. I suspect it has a good chance of being awful. I’m given hope by Feige’s innovation, Zhao’s amazing talent, a decent writer’s room and onscreen talent to rival Ocean’s 11. I really REALLY hope we get what it feels like it’s going to be. Whatever MCU god’s there may be, The One Above All, if this is it’s will, then I’m happy. Please, no laser battle in the end.In baking, as in life and movie making, contrast is key. Here we have the gorgeous natural curves that flow, with a harsh, blocky Eternals starship onscreen. The golden circles act as a foil to the stark, angular block. That massive monolith hints at godlike power as it is juxtaposed against primitive humans all looking at it in wonder. This scene captures something I want to see more of. I have no clue what that thing is, but this scene right here is EVERYTHING.",0 followers,Nicole Kane,616,889,8.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-processor-could-process-faster-than-the-speed-of-light

It was about half the size of the place I had been working at but was assured that they had plenty of work for me. I was skeptical but decided to give it a shot.The service manager was a bit of a dick and a alcoholic, but nothing I couldn't handle. There was a woman that was in charge of the work orders and assigned the jobs to the appropriate technicians. She was also the service managers not so secret mistress .After a short time it was evident that the only reason they needed another tune up tech was due to the incompetent tech they had. He had no diagnostic skills and would just keep replacing parts till something would finally fix the problem.I was outperforming him to the point I was the second highest income producer of the shop. Typically the front end tech was the highest earners in most dealerships. This obviously upset the other tech whom was buddies with the manager and his mistress . They all decided I had to go.I was called in for a meeting and was advised that I was being laid off for lack of work for two tune up techs.I went home and was deciding what I was going to do when the phone rings. It was the CEO of the company calling and asked me to come in to see him.Later on, I went in to have a chat. He said, I have been looking at your performance record and can't figure out why my second highest income employee is being laid off. After a very entertaining conversation, he assured me that if I would come back my position would be secure and if I had any problems to see him directly. Then he called the manager in and had him apologise to me.This made the manager furious but there was nothing he could do about it. I guess he figured between himself and his girlfriend they could make my life miserable and force me to quit. I have pretty thick skin and was having more fun screwing with them.The CEO was watching them from behind the scenes and it wasn't very long before both of them were fired for undisclosed reasons.Once they hired a new service manager the other tech was let go, not only due to his incompetence but he wasn't even a licensed technician.Before all of this nonsense, I hardly knew or seen the CEO but afterwards he always had my back and we got along great.

I had very high hopes for our success. The first few weeks reinforced my initial reaction.Things started to fall apart when she started helping with the technical aspects of the job. She was certain that if she insisted long and loudly enough, that the boiler would fix itself, during normal business hours, and without spare parts. Same thing with the autoclave; I had the most experience on it, and had written the repair manual. Yet, whenever I was called back to look at a problem, she would chastise me for leaving the office to go to the production floor. (If the autoclave didn't get fixed in an hour, we had to work overtime to still make shipments.) My choice was clear: Fix it, teach the maintenance staff how to do it next time, and make the shipment, OR, let them flounder around even longer, at the cost of missing a shipment. That's how I learned to fix the machinery, learning from my mistakes. I think the better plan is to learn from someone else's mistakes.I caught a few ass chewings for stuff like that, nothing I couldn't handle. Her behaviour was progressively worsening. She would change the production schedule without notifying me or the production manager. That's hell on logistics. She swapped drivers around for no reason, making them late to the hospitals as they worked unfamiliar routes.I ordered a little over a million dollars of product for a new customer, and she signed off without hesitation. When I bought two hundred dollars of flowers for our front bed, she took me out to the flower bed and we counted every plant. More than once she charged through a freshly mopped and marked floor and fell hard only to jump up and blame the cleaning man for making her fall.She sat in the inspection closeout meeting with the FDA group so she could ask if she could market our products as FDA approved. She called our customers and asked if I had cursed at them. They would call me after she left, and ask what her problem was. Her behaviour became more mercurial with each passing week.I reached my limit when she wrote me up for yelling at an employee, and using curse words with employees. I have scrupulously avoided those behaviors for my entire career. This was clearly the first step in my removal. I decided to leave. I had an open job offer from a local commercial laundry, but I was waiting on my chief mechanic to finish his vacation before I gave my notice.Two days before I gave notice, the company president called me and asked if I found her behaviour aberrant. I told him that I was watching a fine professional descend into madness. I believed it then, and I believe it now. She had just gotten divorced from a very prominent local surgeon before starting with us, and I think maybe that had something to do with her mental health.The very day I was going to turn in my notice, they fired her. She came into my office singing “Ding dong the witch is dead"". I wished her well and truly meant it.

I knew he was sexually harassing the women in the company, but had no direct proof until I was working for him. I gathered evidence over a few months, then one day I emailed all of it to his boss, claiming my rights under their confidential reporting policy and stating my fear of retribution. His boss thanked me and told me that he’d get back with me. Nothing happened…yet.About 3 weeks later, it was time for my quarterly review. We were IT pros who normally worked out of the office at client sites. My client reviews were like “walks on water, talks with God”. My first review with the new manager was the first I ever had in my life where I “did not meet expectations”. I knew he was lying and I had proof, but I didn’t do anything yet.The next quarter, the client was still totally satisfied with me. I guess saving them roughly $10 million in the first 9 months of my contract was considered a good thing. But, my manager’s review was “Needs improvement to meet expectations” - one grade level down from “Did not meet expectations”. Another lie, and more proof.The next quarter, I was put on a 90 day “Improvement plan” with termination at the end if I did not fully meet expectations, and I had still more proof because I had copies of every single client review that they had ever turned in. By that time I had another job lined up, so I printed off everything I had, not only on his sexual misconduct, but his falsified performance reports, and his boss’s failure to do anything about the sexual harassment report. I not only had proof of my boss’s gross misconduct and lies, but also his boss had violated the “confidential reporting policy” by telling my boss about my report of his wrongdoing.I took all of it to HR, along with my resignation letter, effective immediately. The next day I started at my new job. Two weeks later, after much investigation and interviews of the women who had been harassed, my boss and his boss were terminated with cause. Neither got severance and neither was eligible for unemployment insurance.Karma is a bitch.Edit: I should have said how I document the sexual harassment. I kept a journal with me. People were used to seeing me pull it out at random times and write in it for a minute or two when I had an idea on how to automate something or improve a process.Every time I overheard or saw harassment going on, out came my journal. Date, time, place, woman's name, what she was doing at the time he approached her, what he did, and the conversation on both sides as accurately as I could. Later one of the women told me that it was the detail in the copied journal pages that sunk him because all of the women verified each instance was accurate, and my record was less than 25% of what had gone on.So, ladies, if you are in this situation, start recording the events. Do it on paper. There's a reason attorneys use paper. It's harder to fake evidence when it's written with different pens and the handwriting is subtly different at different times.Edit: Wow! 2,500 upvotes and counting. I would like to thank the many commenters who had kind words to say about my actions. I didn’t think then, and I still don’t think now, that I did anything special. I thought I was doing what was right. I was very idealistic when I was younger, and what they did to the women wasn’t right. What they did to me afterwards wasn’t right. I thought you were supposed to speak up when something wasn’t right. It was my first experience with the penalty you will pay for laying bare the misdeeds of those in power, and it was the first time I saw corruption in action. Other experiences in life have given me a complete distrust of anyone in any position with even a little bit of power. I still speak up. I still pay the price, and even though my idealism is overlaid with cynicism now, I still believe we can be a better society than we are if more people speak up about the wrongdoing of those in power. The idealist in me is still there.",136 followers,Robert LeVan,7.8K,740,449.6K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

This consultant came out to spend a day riding with me to see for himself how things were going. He spent the day telling me that I was doing a good job. However, he was horribly annoying and condescending overall.I dropped him off at his hotel and drove the 15 mile trip home. At home, I called the owner of the business to tell her that if she sent him out to ride with me again, I would quit. She broke up laughing. I thought that was an inappropriate response, but waited until she stopped laughing to say anything more. Before I spoke, she stopped laughing and said something along the lines of, “He called me 20 minutes ago and fired you. Of course, I told him that he didn’t have the authority to do that, and that your job was safe.”Within a week, his contract had been terminated. (Of course, it helped a lot that the owner knew me well and had personally hired me, even though I had zero sales experience at the time.)","1,769 followers",Eric Ivers,1.8K,2.2K,16.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

One he placed on the company credit card, and the other on his personal card. The president of the company was a cheapskate, and did not allow first class travel anywhere, so this was a red flag already. Also, my toddler boss had instructed me to NOT tell our German distributor that he was coming out there.

(This would be the first of three times in my career I would receive severance after I resigned.)About a week after starting my new job, I got an email from a colleague. Among other gossip, he told me that the VP of engineering, Leah’s boss and a vicious termagant whose greedy and unethical behavior had not only been one of my main reasons for leaving, but, I believe, was part of what ultimately destroyed the company, had announced “restructuring” that resulted in “layoffs”. The plural was barely justified; the only employees being laid off were me and Leah.I called Leah and confirmed. They had offered her a month of severance, then two months, to sign a hold-harmless agreement. I realized, from the body count, what was going on.My former employer offered free mass files-storage to its customers, an expensive proposition back in 2005. As a cost-saving measure, the VP had ordered that the files of inactive customers be discarded, without warning.She had tried a pilot project of deleting the files of the oldest customers. Inside a week, there was a kerfuffle in the papers: we had deleted all the wedding photos of some customer who hadn’t been by in two years. It was terrible press and more than that, it was a dick move on our part.Leah and I had opposed any further deletions. We argued with the VP at meetings, we proposed alternatives, we generally made it clear that we thought it was a bad idea. The VP had decided to solve the problem in the way that would appeal to any tyrant, by removing the people who opposed her.I told Leah I thought she should stand her ground and not sign anything. I also emailed to her lawyer several cases I saw online about “discharge contrary to public policy” — firing employees because they had tried to stop their employers from various unethical actions.I actually don’t know how it turned out.

He just forgot to tear it up or to tell the assistant manager to disregard it.

There was a disagreement as to how he could re-arrange work in another department because they were overworked. Part of the work that landed on my desk was to check the paperwork for errors then feed it through this other department. In the middle of this disagreement with the department heads, he discovered that I’d been doing some of this department’s work, with my bosses knowledge, in order to take some of the stress off the employees there.He threw a fit, there is no other word for it. Pounding on the desk, standing up and shouting. I sat there, and tried at a couple of points to get a word in, but couldn’t. I finally was done. I was ticked at my own boss for not stepping in, I was very angry at this VP for treating the adults who were in this meeting like they were three year olds, and for acting like a child himself.I started to get up, he said “you are not dismissed!”.

I told her as I stood up at one point that I wasn’t being insubordinate but that I really had to go to the bathroom and I’d be right back. I did and I was. She continued to berate me. After rounds were over, my officemate came in and was told to leave. The berating continued.So what she didn’t know was that I was in Adult Children of Alcoholics and had been taking self-defense classes which included verbal self-defense. I didn’t let her off the hook for saying a bunch of gaslighting things to me. I was respectful and asked for an example of what I needed improving. She couldn’t give me even one specific thing I’d done wrong. She just kept saying terrible things to me. Eventually, one of the doctors came in, asked me for my report on my patients, and that was the end of the berating. (I think he went to the department head about it, but I’m not sure. It’s the kind of thing he would have done. He was a good man who worked well with me and who respected me quite a lot).I took it to the director of the department. I told her what had happened and that I didn’t think it was appropriate. Could she tell me what I was doing wrong so I could improve rather than just “nobody likes” me?The following Monday or Tuesday, the director came to my office - unheard of. We always went to her. She sat down and said I’d been vindicated. I remember I didn’t like that word because it sounded too war-like, too fighty. The supervisor was fired for not coming to work every Monday. It turned out she was an alcoholic and was too hung over or too drunk to come to work on Mondays.Having learned lots of healthy communication techniques helped me quite a lot in that instance. I’m sure I was upset about it, but I know I handled it professionally and appropriately. I hadn’t known she was an alcoholic - at least not consciously, but I instinctively used healthy responses to her. It was actually an important moment for me because it highlighted how much I had healed from some serious trauma in my life.I hope she found some recovery.*In response to questions about verbal self-defense:There are a few things. A lot of it boils down to “I” statements and owning your authority. Here are some resources that I found helpful:I would strongly suggest learning this in a group setting because it is important to be able to look someone in the eye, role play, improvise on the spot.",626 followers,Pamila Jo Florea,989,1.5K,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

This was classic…I wound up working for the CIO at Pennzoil the summer between graduating college and starting graduate school. He was a super interesting guy, pushing the envelope on a bunch of fronts and liked me because I was a utility player with a bunch of experience that was easy to operationalize, in a bunch of different areas.At one point, I was assigned to the Professional Development group. Now, back in the day, most of the “business process” software was written in-house, in COBOL, running on IBM mainframes, which mostly ran MVS. The people they hired into the in-house development group had largely graduated with degrees in “business” with a course or two in programming, as opposed to the modern approach of hiring computer science graduates.This led to a bunch of unequal performance, as the people were tossed into the deep end, and expected to perform, and many of them had never had to deal with the vagaries of IBM systems, including the dreaded Job Control Language. I was “volunteered” to fix this, by creating a series of courses to pick them up wherever they happened to be, and walk them through the stuff they needed to know to be able to run both test and production jobs on the production mainframe.I was also given a punch list of the most common things people fucked up, and asked to make sure that I covered all those things in a way that was instructive, to both help the novice programmer realize that something had gone off the rails, and how to fix it.In this assignment, I reported to the manager of the Professional Development group. He was a colossal tool who took pride in taunting me about how my degree with honors from a top 10 school had worked out so well that I was teaching newbies from Central Texas Bible College how to unbreak their COBOL programs instead of, you know, sending people to Mars or curing cancer.Most of my co-workers were pretty decent people — though the office admin took some acclimating to the fact that I typed about twice as fast as she did and that I preferred to do my own document processing as opposed to hand-writing then giving it to her. And they all had stories about how Ron, the manager, had fucked them over at one point or another.A couple of weeks in, I’m looking at how to handle an infinite loop. In JCL, there’s a time-limit parameter that you could apply to the run deck that would limit the number of CPU minutes that your program ran. One of the easy-to-fuck-up things was either getting the syntax wrong — and asking for termination in 15 days instead of 15 minutes — or just forgetting and omitting it. In either case, how to determine something had gone south was the challenge.Most of the big mainframes that I’d worked on by that point had a system default limit, usually pretty low. Thus if you screwed up, and forget to specify a run limit, the job would terminate really early — like 20 seconds or something — instead of running to infinity. I probed the systems group, and they disclaimed knowledge of any such limit, but I was pretty sure that there had to be one, because who would set up a system without it?I proposed to test and determine this. However, that was problematic — in those days, most mainframe computer centers ran on something called “cost recovery” — they took the total cost of running the system for the year — depreciation, maintenance, power, space, priests and acolytes, everything — and divided by 31,536,000 (a lot less catchy than “five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes”, no?) to set the dollars per second that you were “charged” — in an inter-departmental transfer, real cash money — for running your programs.In a day where you have 500x the power of an ’80s supercomputer in your phone, and unlimited “free” compute cycles on your laptop, I know that sounds crazy, but that’s how it worked. And frankly, that came out to be something on the order of four bucks a second. Also crazy.Anyway, I wrote a memo, delivered by email, that I wanted to run this experiment because no one could find an actual answer. I was going to intentionally write a program with an infinite loop, and run it, in a job with the JCL job limit card missing — and see where the system time limit auto-terminated me (and for that matter, what the error code that this termination threw, because I needed that as well).I got back a “sure” from the manager, and off I went.A couple hours later, I came back from lunch, and heard that the CIO had come by my desk, looking for me, explosively angry. Someone in the systems operations group had noticed this job that I’d run, that was not stopping and that was eating all the CPU cycles available, blocking other jobs from running, and O-M-G it had eaten up the entire departmental budget for computing for the rest of the year, something like $50k.So they’d killed the program (also a useful error code to know!) and called him. He’d called Ron, the manager, since it was running on his budget, with a giant “what the fuck is this?” and Ron… well, good old Ron threw me under the bus.On hearing my return, Ron emerged from his lair, and said, “This is very serious” and said we needed to go see the CIO, and that I needed to bring my badge and my personal effects. At this point I still had no idea what was going on, but Ron was smiling like crazy.So, we head into the CIO’s office, and Ron says words to the effect of, “Here’s the miscreant that you’re looking for” and sits back and the CIO unloads on me about how stupid and irresponsible I’ve been and that I’m fired and and and…At this point I interrupt and ask, politely, what the everloving fuck is going on. When he explains how my experiment ended up, I instantly get it. And explain exactly how I got there. And then produce the memo and authorization.At which point I really thought that the CIO’s head was going to explode.I was thanked for both highlighting the deficit in the system, got an apology, asked to figure out what the “right” number should be for a system default and how to implement that, and asked to close my door on my way back to my desk.We never saw Ron again. He didn’t come back that afternoon, and the following morning some guys from facilities packed up his desk. One of the analysts in the group was promoted to manager, and one of the programmers we had a good realtionship with was moved to her former role.There was great rejoicing.And for the rest of the time I was there, I was “the guy who got Ron fired.”","36,276 followers",Stan Hanks,1.4K,7.7K,65.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

I told them to go ahead and fire me if they felt they had to, but I wouldn’t be part of something that could kill someone, and I would have to report it to the relevant people. He brought me in front of his boss who was in the store as well. (It was a corporate walk-through.) I told his boss everything about my safety concerns (his boss had started in my section). He had me show him how I had them set up, and how I thought it was the best way to set them up and keep them safe. I was told not to worry about anything.A month later there was a companywide directive to set this section up exactly how I had set them up, and shortly later the boss’s boss resigned his position for undisclosed reasons.",28 followers,Jimmy Schmidel,614,205,133.6K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever

It was an 83 question survey actually and we even had people there to help if someone was confused.After the event, I told Mr. boss we needed to send out Thank you cards to those that came and registered and he brushed me off. A couple of days later I reminded him and again, he just told me not to worry about it. Well, we were working in a community where it was expected to be at least acknowledged if you helped, so a few days later brought it up again. Mr. Boss told me that he would take careHAHA! YES!!!

Mr. Boss told me that he would take care of it when he wanted to. So, I went to the director of the center and casually mentioned the cards had not been sent. Mr Boss found out and went ballistic on the director and told him that he was not to talk with HIS (Mr Boss’s) employee unless the director spoke with Mr Boss first. Mr Boss did this in front of a bunch of the director’s patients. 15 minutes later, Mr Boss came into our office with security and the HR manager and told me he had been fired for his actions. The cards were sent immediately after.",0 followers,Alastair McMullan,9.4K,272,1M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-mind-blow-ever
