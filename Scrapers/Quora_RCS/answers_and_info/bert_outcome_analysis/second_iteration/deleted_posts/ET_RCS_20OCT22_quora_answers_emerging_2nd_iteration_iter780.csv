A group of young guys and girls had been talking loudly and cackling for hours. At 10 pm, after trying unsuccessfully to ignore the ruckus and drift off to sleep, I got up and politely requested them to be quieter. One of them apologized and agreed to keep the volume low. 30 minutes later, I still couldn't sleep as they continued bickering and shouting like a bunch of wasted drunkards. I went up to them again and reminded them that it was way past 9 pm (the railway timing for sleeping hours). On hearing this, the same person who had apologized earlier said, ""What if we won't? We have bought tickets for the journey and will do whatever we wish to. If you wanted to sleep, go to your bedroom.""I was appalled at this distorted sense of personal freedom. I searched for the TTE and narrated the incident to him. He in turn sent a railway guard with me. The guard confronted the group regarding my complaint, at which all of them decided to deny any such incident. One of them said, ""He's exaggerating. We were planning to go to sleep and were simply talking the way friends do."" At which point I asked him, ""Didn't I come to you half an hour earlier and requested you to tone it down? Didn't you tell me the second time that I wasn't in my bedroom and that you are free to do anything because you had purchased the tickets? Give me one good reason why I should wander off the length of the train trying to find some authoritative figure to come down if there was no issue at all."" None of them had any answer. The guard told them, ""Your lights are still on. Your seats are still up. I could hear noise while entering this compartment. I have seen many like you to know that you are likely at fault. If I receive another complaint, you will be asked to get down at the next station.""Thanks to the incredibly helpful TTE and guard, the rest of the night went better.However, during all this time, there were more than 50 other people in the coach. A lot of them were visibly disturbed by the ruckus themselves. Few of them watched me talk to these folks the first two times from their seats. Sadly, none of them intervened or voiced their opinions. These wimps were equally at fault.This isn't an isolated incident. You can find representatives of both population sets in almost every public place. This is precisely why I have stopped going to the theaters to watch movies. People talking on the phone, and with each other, cat-calling, shouting ""funny"" remarks and jokes ruin the experience. But none more than the ones who choose to keep mum because they forgot their spine back at home.Someone's playing loud music on their phones in public transport? Grunt, murmur, and ignore.Someone's misbehaving with a woman, an elderly person, or an under-privileged one? Stand by, watch, and walk away shaking your head, murmuringSee one person being overpowered and bullied by a group? Keep walking, ""it's not your fight.""So yes, these are the two biggest problems in India:A grand ""Fuck You"" to both!",0 followers,Sudesh Kumar,35.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-and-worst-things-about-India-or-Indians

He used to swear at me by calling me names( prostitute) for minor issues. I was walking on eggshells all the time. He threw the dessert I made in to the sink because I made it when he told me not to do so. Reason he says is I should listen to him and do as he says. I was abused for petty petty things.

It still surprises me all these decades later that as an untrained student I managed to get it to work - well, it did.So, there I was, with a functioning microprocessor board. Initially, as input device it had a small hex keyboard (zero through nine, A through F, enter key, and I think it had a backspace - not sure about that though), and as output device it had a multiple-character LED segmented display capable of a single line of text. (Both input and output devices were subsequently replaced with better options, but that was the first configuration).I managed to find the following image on the web. The one I built then was certainly similar to this.The only interface ‘language’ was machine code. Not assembly - machine code. Bytes of machine language. For a short while it was fun coding tiny programs in hex and getting them to display stuff, but that wore off quickly. So, of course, this being the 70’s and not the early 60’s, the next goal was to make it understand a programming language - the one selected was interpreted Basic. We found a paper published by a Japanese guy (I think) which had a complete basic interpreter for the processor listed in machine code. I still remember with amusement that below the title of the paper was a tongue-in-cheek line which read “Copyleft, all wrongs reserved”. (Edit - someone found the original article. Li-Chen Wang published his “tiny basic” in 1976, and he was Chinese, not Japanese.I keyed in the entire program, and burnt it into whatever Eprom the system supported (probably something like 8 or 16 Kbyte). I must have got that right too, because from that point on it was possible to “talk” to the microprocessor in Basic.So, one possible answer to your question : A first programming language can be brought into existence by implementing it in machine language, coding every byte manually, and burning it into an Eprom (or other programmable memory device).","56,373 followers",Charlie Cheever,5.9K,1.5K,9.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-and-worst-things-about-India-or-Indians

And good Wifi transmitters within the ship which don’t loose connection when you go to the toilet. And no broadband filter ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).Oh, almost forgot! For in-system movement, we’ll have a kind of impulse drive that can be throttled, but can go anywhere in a solar system within 10 seconds, with autopilot, naturally.The main bridge can be operated by 5 people minimum, but has space for 10. This is gonna look lovely and brightly lit and cosy, not like a submarine or battleship, after all it’s just 10 of us civilians.Yes, let’s get some lovely cosy wood panelling, eh? Now that’s proper TNG Belle Epoque cosiness right there!Main engineering is completely computer controlled, but is open to people and resembles a TNG main engineering, ’cause who wouldn’t want to play laser tag around a warp core?No image for that but i wish there was one.Now, for the inside layout.Well, in the middle, i’d have a sort of park environment where I could garden and tend to pets and stuff like that.Like this, but bigger and in a starship.For the other rooms:All the other stuff would just be empty spaces, customisable at our leisure.Speaking of customisation: Instant replicators! They would be the thing that allowed us to customise our spaces as needed, and can dissolve a whole chunk of the ship and reshape it to our specifications, as well as good old food replication (sorry Neelix!)In the aforementioned cargo bay, I would have shuttles there for use in planetary missions, but which could be customisably replicated, with TNG-style holographic predictors for what they would look like. Not only that, we’d also have transporters, ’cause why not?Just for fun, let’s say it can land on a planet’s surface if necessary.Now we get to the fun stuff: Weapons. Because when you give a guy like me free lease over a spaceship, you know it’s gonna have guns! (Or maybe you don’t, in which case you shouldn’t have given me creative control!)For the weapons, i’d have 4 turrets. But, instead of firing shells, they’d fire aLike this, but bigger and unstoppable.I’m also going to make my shields impenetrable to all weaponry, even a TSDAD (mentioned above).Oh, also, let’s have a phaser-like system, but unstoppable in every way. Let’s say… 10 phaser emitters? Sounds reasonable?BTW it’s got a Nemesis-style phased cloaking device, which allows you to phase through solid rock, and allow weapons fire and shields when cloaked (Just a few more gallons of petrol for the fire!)An accurate picture of my spaceship when clocked. A beaut, ain’t she?So, essentially, a Lost In Space spaceship but more streamlined and bigger and unstoppable and universe-traversing.Like Lost In Space, i’d roam around the Universe with my friends, stopping to make contact with new species and picking up wacky aliens as I went along, while having a dilemma to solve in every system I stopped at, sometimes physical, sometimes philosophical, sometimes generally confusing. Sounds like a good idea for a TV show.

One with armor that speaks with power. One that could take a shot from the sun and come out unscathed. Whether it be a huge, gargantuan sci-fi ship, or one that syphons energy from the asteroid it’s built around, these things are HUGE.With lenghts and heights exceeding double digits in KILOMETERS, these things could take a beating.But really. What would you rather have: A huge Starcraft, with hyper-thick armor and the biggest guns, capable of both being a huge target and taking the blows from said target, or a small, nimble, fast and maneuverable ship, one that’s sleek and instead of taking the blows, can avoid them all together?Meet, the STARDUST©.OUTSIDE LOOKS:You can tell this ship was built with two uses in mind: 1) A Fighter, one that shoots down enemies before the enemies targeting computers can even process a battle-plan and lock target, much less load, prep, and fire the weapons. And even if they could, you would be gone hundreds of kilometers away by that point.As for dimensions:* 80 Meters In Length (Rear Engine to Nose)INSIDE LOOKS:This suggests the back is where all the dangerous chemicals and freezing/scalding fluids are at. The Engines and Power Generators are back here. It’s very worn down, dust coats the metal machines and gets in the small holes and cracks that seem to pop-up everywhere… this area is probably avoided. Probably wasn’t cleaned in a long while.Towards the MIDDLE and FRONT of the STARDUST©, however, the halls start looking sleeker and sleeker. At this point, the halls are mostly a sleek gray. Patrolled by automatic cleaning droids, the place is kept nice and well-kept. But, even with the cleaning droids, the place tends to still maintain minor cracks. The halls and walls are dotted with screens and other things. Boxes and doors leading to unknown areas of the ship are covered with WARNING and TOXIC labels. Be careful!The FRONT of the STARDUST© tends to have a more ‘futuristic’ feel. With Holograms and screens everywhere, wide windows placed every square inch, and dark gray stainless steel (or perhaps Durasteel. Maybe even Dark-Matter Infused Neutronium?) covering everything, it feels like something straight out of a Sci-Fi Movie.CREW/LIFE SUPPORT:1. WaterThe first one is easy enough to get for the STARDUST©. Water, clean water at that, is generated when Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms combine into a molecule. Oxygen, we’ll get to that in a minute. Whilst Hydrogen is a bit more difficult. The STARDUST© has a built in system to extract gases and minerals from asteroids, planets, stars, or even black holes. Every once in a while, the STARDUST© will extract natural gases such as Hydrogen from planets and gas giants.The gas is then compressed and stored away as a liquid in a super-cooled compartment until needed.Food is simply stored; processed and compressed meats as well as a few special treats such as cake, pizza, ice-cream, and a few interstellar snacks from across the known universe are stored. Whilst fruits and vegetables are grown aboard, on the Stardust in it’s own Agricultural area.Warmth is easy enough; that’s generated and syphoned by the power generators and engines around the ship.Oxygen is taken from planets and gas giants, much like hydrogen, but can also be generated by the plants used to make the fruits and vegetables.As for the crew… there isn’t any. It’s not like it’s needed. Sure, there’s more than enough space and working areas, and certainly enough resources to support a dozen people and a few civilians, but no. I would rather be all by my lonesome. Lone ranger, that’s me.AI:The main A.I. is known simply as ‘Kelvin’. No, no. Not Calvin or Kevin. Kelvin, like the temperature. This custom-made A.I is integrated as part of the ship itself, and is fully sentient. That means that ‘Kelvin’ can be talked to, and discussions can be made. ‘Kelvin’ can be instructed to do almost anything that the ship is capable of. Ask him to open the door, done. Ask him to turn on the lights, done. Ask him to turn off the main power reactor, done. Ask him to fix the broken window, done. Ask him to brew you some coffee, done. Anything that is part of the ship and is connected to his Power Core (The ‘Brain’ of ‘Kelvin’.) can be operated and changed.The STARDUST© also has a sufficiently advanced combat simulation A.I, named ‘Celsius’. ‘Celsius’ is mostly sentient, but can’t really grasp concepts such as death and life, and emotions either, unlike ‘Kelvin’. ‘Celsius’s’ purpose is to rapidly simulate combat, and often take over controls of the ‘Stardust’ is the pilot is about to blow himself up. It accesses risks and chances and determines the best and most optimal way to destroy the enemy, achieve the objective with taking minimal damage. Can be ordered to either be ‘Careful’, which will make Celsius try it’s best to avoid any and all damage, and only engage if the chances are above 95%.‘Normal’ which makes Celsius engage multiple crafts at the same time, and Celsius will naturally protect vitals and most important bits of the craft. Will only engage if the projected chance is above 80%. Will disengage if substantial damage is withstood.‘Aggressive’ mode makes Celsius engage a practically unlimited amount of crafts, even ones above it’s own technological level. Will attack if chances are 60% or more. Will only protect vitals and disengage if damage sustained is critical.‘Nononono’ mode, however, will make Celsius engage no matter the chances of success, and can be ordered to ignore all damage and continue fighting. DO NOT USE THIS.The STARDUST© is also equipped with an uncountable amount of other A.I’s, including a droid, medical robots, and a huge amount of unsentient ones only to be used for specific tasks. (Such as ‘Rankine’, an A.I. designed to optimize shields.)COMMUNICATIONS:The set in question is the ‘Quantum Databanks Uplink’ set. It sends out massless particles encoded with your message at infinite speeds, taking advantage of Hyperspace in order to have instant communications to anywhere in the universe. Sure, technology can only get you so far, and over Galactic distances the reception will be a bit fuzzy. But when will you ever be ordering pizza from seventy galaxies away? ‘Space Pizza Hut’ is right around the corner near Betelgeuse, god damn it!POWER GENERATION:The Main Power Generator of the STARDUST© is the Singularity Energy Extraction Module. It creates a mini black-hole and then takes energy using the immense tidal forces and gravity waves to steal pure dark energy out of the black hole.Placed in a huge, round chamber filled with gizmos shooting blue lightning into it in order to steal it’s energy.The STARDUST© also, of course, has side-generators. These are two Zero-Point Energy Reactors,Four Anti-Matter Reactors,Eight Back-up Fusion Reactors,Sixteen Back-up Fission Reactors,And finally, one Solar Core reactor. This one is incredibly dangerous, but generates copious amounts of energy. In the case all backup-reactors fail, or don’t create enough energy, one can turn this one on and hope for the best.FTL TRAVEL:The STARDUST© has a few different types of FTL Drives. The main one is an ‘Atlantis’ class Quantum Fusion Warp Drive, which effectively jumps between locations in space-time using a bubble. This one has a top speed of about 100,000,000,000 C. Average speed is 70,000,000,000 C.An Advanced Wormhole Modulator, which allows instanteous jumping between wormhole portals.A Slipstream Hyperspace Drive, and a back-up Hyperlane Hyperdrive. What are those? You see, there is an alternate dimension called Hyperspace. Entering through certain breach points allows access. In there, a Hyperlane drive can allow you to fly through Hyperlanes, which in turn allows faster travel.A Slipstream is the Hyperspace of Hyperspace. A Slipstream Drive is extremely fast travel.DEFLECTOR SHIELDS:To say the least, these Deflector Shields are one of the best in the galaxy. Fast recharge rate, too.SENSORS:When at close range, these can even pick up the internal properties and logistics about the craft. Operates closely with ‘Celsius’, to make perfect battleplans.ARMOR:The Hyper-crystal, imported from the Tadpole Galaxy, has deflective properties, meaning energy weapons not outfitted to get around this will be dispersed across the entire ship and lower the impact overall. On a large ship, this practically makes energy weapons have a non-existent threat, while on such a small ship as the STARDUST©, it’s still a dangerous threat.Weapons based on Kinetic Energy can quite easily shred through the Hypercrystal and Durasteel, but the Dark Matter-infused Durasteel alloy is reinforced using strands of Neutronium, and Kinetic Weapons effectiveness stops right there.Explosive weapons can pass through the shields on rare occasions, whether the explosive substance isn’t picked up or whatever, the explosive weapons will burn through the Hypercrystal and decimate the Durasteel alloy if strong enough, but then the combination of Dark Matter, Neutronium, Hypercrystal, and to top it all off having it matter compressed can stop just about anything. It’s weakness is it’s thinness, as this armor is expensive.SUB-LIGHT BURNERS (ENGINES):","4,203 followers",Joseph Reinemann,1.2K,14.9K,36.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-and-worst-things-about-India-or-Indians
