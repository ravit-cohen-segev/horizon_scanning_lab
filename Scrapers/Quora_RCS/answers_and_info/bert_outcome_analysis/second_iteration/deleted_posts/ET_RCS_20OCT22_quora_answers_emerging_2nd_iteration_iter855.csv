Apple has been struggling to innovate since Jobs died. It’s an insular, almost arrogant company - which was fine with Jobs at the helm, but without him I don’t think the management has been as effective. Most of Apple’s revenues comes from the iPhone which has been un-inspirational in recent cycles and in many ways outclassed by rival products - and this dependability on the iPhone also means the company is not as diversified as Google or Microsoft. If Apple loses its sex appeal with fickle consumers, like Blackberry did - it just takes a few bad product cycles for that to happen - things could turn around for the worse relatively fast.Saying this, I don’t think any of them are going to fall anytime soon.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,14.4K,996,155.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Apple-and-Microsoft-succeed-when-there-were-many-other-companies-like-the-MITS

So we have it turned off in all of our computers in the data center. The reason the hyperthreading option ON/OFF switch exists in the BIOS is that for some applications it is a net loser. It turns out that pretending you have more cores than you really do is bad if you are dealing with lots of interrupts. The CPU has to guarantee accurate execution, and when you are half-way through an operation, pretending you have another core, and an interrupt comes in, you have to throw away lots of already done computations, and if you have a high enough interrupt rate hyperthreading is a net loss.With intel having so little competition at the high end, processor evolution has slowed dramatically, and the processors of a few years back are only slightly slower compared to the current intel product line. The real battle happening now is over power consumption versus computation, and Intel is racing to catch up to ARM which came out of nowhere and took over the market in mobile. Nowadays data centers are 99% intel architecture, but cellphones are 99% ARM, and these two companies have designs on each other’s territory. This is one of the greatest hardware battles of all time. Sadly AMD after innovating so strongly and fighting so scrappily has run out of money and the outrageously anticompetitive “rebate if you only buy my brand of chip” tactics of intel, which should have been outlawed, cut off their air supply.And if you really want to know a surprising fact, some intel i3 chips are faster than the i5 or and i7 models if you are running a single threaded program. It seems impossible, but benchmarks prove it true. There are tradeoffs inside the chip, and if you are only running one thread, certain i3 models outperform much more expensive chips.Pay no attention to standard benchmark programs that do some useless task that you are never going to do. CPU designers build for those benchmark programs, and they don’t accurate measure ordinary performance. Measuring how fast it boots Windows, or Rotates a photoshop image, or runs a game, is a much better test. Samsung for example was caught speeding up their cellphones to cheat on benchmarks; they would recognize the benchmark program name and temporarily speed up the phone so it overclocked it to fool reviewers. Sad to say, solid state drives have done more to improve computer performance in the last 5 years than CPU evolution, which has stalled. Moore’s law is long dead, and the whole industry is waiting for a new memory technology, as the CPU is now sitting there waiting for memory a lot of the time now; i understand that on modern chips it takes 100 clocks to get a piece of memory in from RAM. Some reader will inevitably comment that a certain favorite program of theirs can take advantage of 20 cores, but the vast majority of programs are written naively, and don’t take much advantage of multiple cores.Another thing people don’t realize in the laptop world is that the mobile version of the i7 is thermally limited; and once you really start to crunch the numbers the chip will throttle itself down in speed, because otherwise it would overheat. Computation generates heat, and most laptops have piss-poor cooling systems, and thankfully the intel chips slow themselves down before they melt. In 2010 apple built a mac mini and a 17 inch laptop that basically melted the solder on the motherboard it got so hot due to a design defect whereby the GPU didn’t get good contact with the heat sink. Their 17 inch laptops got such a bad reputation, they discontinued the size. Every day ARM improves their CPU power, and it is by no means clear who will win the next big battle. Intel is a formidable opponent, often resorting to dirty tricks, and has a huge head start, but i believe that the mobile space is producing such incredible volumes of chips that eventually ARM and one of its partners like Qualcomm will give Intel a serious battle, and might have to fire up their brains again instead of their current strategy of flooding the market with so many confusing editions of the same chip nobody can figure it out.News Flash! Intel has released i9 chips and Apple offers it in one of their higher-end MacBook Pro models, and guess what the i9 is thermally limited there too, so it is a waste of money! If you want to use an i9 to its full potential you gotta have good cooling, and that is super hard to do in a laptop. When you buy a laptop with a fancy chip, it may only provide a few seconds of extra oomph before it has to be slowed down for thermal protection. As manufacturers obsess about thinness, they are cutting out the room needed for thermal systems.News Flash! Apple has released their M1 chip, and because it runs cooler than the intel chips, they don’t have to throttle it down so quickly, and strenuous benchmarks show it is the fastest laptop Apple has ever made, beating all Intel models. It’s all about computing power per Watt, and the ARM architecture in 2021 has a decided advantage.",0 followers,Branko Jovanovic,1.5K,1.3K,6.2M,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Apple-and-Microsoft-succeed-when-there-were-many-other-companies-like-the-MITS
7,"Multithreading (and multi-tasking) has existed in every intel cpu since the 286. I think you mean Intel HyperThread technology.Hyper-Threading Technology(HTT)Multithreading (and multi-tasking) has existed in every intel cpu since the 286. I think you mean Intel HyperThread technology.Hyper-Threading Technology(HTT)HTT is a non-preemptive multi-tasking technology that runs two thread stacks at equal priority. Each thread stack must still be managed by the OS via preemptive multitasking (assuming you are using a modern OS).This can be good or bad.In regards to i5 vs i7, they both support HTT. The difference is in the total number of virtual cores. An i5 has a hard limit of 4 virtual cores. This means a dual-core i5 has HTT, but a quad-core i5 does not. The quad core i5 will outperform the dual-core HTT i5, and in most cases the dual-core i7. Beyond HTT, other key differences are that the i7 has a higher base clock rate, and less boost. The i5 has a lower base clock rate but higher boost. For much less money, those that understand what they need, will buy an i5 quad core that has a turbo boost rate faster than the comperable i7, and this system will generally perform only 1–2% less than the i7 equivalent, but will cost 50–100% less. In some applications (computational ones) the i5 will actually run faster, because it does not have HTT interfering with computations. Less threads is always faster than more threads, when solving computational problems, as you dont have the overhead of splitting the problem and merging the results. And if these threads are both on the same physical core, then you dont get a performance boost of solving two problems at once.A single core 2 Ghz CPU with HTT is the same as a dual core 1 GHz CPU. Only the HTT is less efficient, because the CPU must manage those Hyper Theeads. Each process will behave differently. A good rule of thumb in building a system is to assume the HTT when fully engaged, will be 90% as fast as if the cores were physical at half the speed.The beauty of HTT is not that they are faster, because they arent, it is that they are more consist, or predictable in terms of performance. Two threads on a single HTT core will run smoother than the same two theads on a non HTT core. But, not faster. Total run time of the two will still be nearly identical(thread queue managment will add some overhead)","3,473 followers",Timothy McSwain,610,1.4K,5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Apple-and-Microsoft-succeed-when-there-were-many-other-companies-like-the-MITS

If you want to have multiple applications like webbrowsers, media players and instant messaging clients running without a single lag, you just need an i3. Even an older one will do.The other ones are better suited for gamers, graphic designers, and people that need to produce and edit videos constantly and are using very heavy applications like software from the Adobe suite, digital music workstations as Cubase, or even for developers that need to make software and test in multiple virtual machines and emulate different architectures.In my case, I'm a developer and I find that to work productively I have to use one or multiple virtual machines inside my computer, so a very fast i5 or a mddile range i7 with virtualization extensions is the ideal. But I'm working with an i3 350M (my laptop) and even using just one virtual machine with Eclipse makes it to lag, and even to freeze the computer :DHere are a few links to the ARK Intel website. Here Intel exposes official data about the capabilities of all their cpu models. As far as I've seen, all i3, i5, and i7 sports at least 2 cores and I'd say most of them also have Hyper-Threading if there is a model that doesn't have it.4th Generation Intel® Core™ i3 Processors","16,336 followers",Jae Alexis Lee,3.7K,4.6K,42.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Apple-and-Microsoft-succeed-when-there-were-many-other-companies-like-the-MITS
