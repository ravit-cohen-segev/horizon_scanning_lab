The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it? That depends on how much I value my time spent getting it to work… but that’s part of the fun.I am typing this answer on that computer (though it has been upgraded to water cooling).More details.",5 followers,Matthew Lai,3K,3.9K,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-outdated-supercomputers

Now that supercomputers are actually large collections of computing modules, they might get separated into smaller pieces. Once the supercomputer or its pieces reach the point where ordinary desktop systems or servers (or a modest collection of them) catch up with them in computing power, the power bill to run the supercomputer can no longer be justified and it is scrapped.A few supercomputers find their way into museums, though the upcoming generation of massive exascale systems will never reach a museum as a complete system because they’re much too large. The most recently announced one, Frontier, is being built by AMD and Cray for Oak Ridge National Laboratory; it will cover about two basketball courts worth of space.To put that in perspective, the smartphone in your pocket is a much more powerful computer than a Cray-1, introduced in 1975 as the first supercomputer. The Cray-1 weighed 5.5 tons. A Galaxy S10 weighs 5.5 ounces. The Cray CPU consumed 115 kilowatts of electricity, and that number was likely doubled once the storage and cooling system was added in. The battery in the S10 has a total capacity of about 12.5 watt hours and that’s enough to run the phone for a day; the peak power consumption is probably under 10 watts. The Cray had 8 megabytes of RAM; the Galaxy has 8 gigabytes. The Cray CPU ran at 80 MHz; the Galaxy has 8 CPU cores that each run at speeds of about 2 GHz. All in all, the Cray-1 might make a nice piece of lobby seating in 2019 (it was built as a round kiosk and had seats around the perimeter), but actually trying to use it as a computer would be ludicrous.A picture of the Cray-1:","4,793 followers",Jan Christian Meyer,2.7K,2.2K,6.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-outdated-supercomputers

Let me relate my experience.On our recent road trip from San Diego to Clinton, Iowa, it was near dark as we reached the city limits of Clinton. Just as we did it started to rain heavily. A few seconds later the sky opened up and the heavy rain became what we call in Iowa, a Gully Washer. I was using Navigate on Autopilot, driving on the main road which led to the side street where our hotel destination was situated. I could see through the windshield by watching a 2 inch wide strip of cleared glass created as the windshield wiper passed back and forth. Other cars kept going and as I couldn’t see the road, I followed the car ahead of me. (Autopilot made that much easier than trying to stop as it even kept within the lane pretty much.) I could not see but I guess the cameras on the bumper below the headlights could see well enough. When the navigator told me to turn left in 200 feet, I couldn’t do that because I couldn’t see at all out the side window or the corner of the windshield. That is, nothing but flowing water, so I continued, to which Autopilot directed me to make a U-turn. On returning to the intersection of my turn, I caught a glimpse of a street sign and so, moving very slowly, turned around the sign. Water was flowing at least 6″ deep across the intersection but after a 50 or 100 feet, the crown of the road emerged and I realized that the rain was letting up.We made it to the hotel parking lot which was full, shoes soaked getting into the door, and after checking in, waited the storm out which didn’t take long.The point of this whole story is that the Tesla Autopilot will never have the opportunity to opporate in the dark. The headlights provide enough light for the autopilot which can (in this case) see much better than a human driver. And if the battery is down to where the lights go out, I doubt the car will drive very far anyway.",3 followers,Steve Baker,574,27.3K,162.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-outdated-supercomputers

The school would pick the best ads for each company andI’m not a teacher, but I have a really good example of plagiarism for you.My newspaper used to run a “design an ad” contest in the local schools. We did this through 2019, but stopped during the pandemic and haven’t done one since. We would get a bunch of our better advertisers to agree to be in the contest. We’d make a list of the advertisers and send it to the schools. We’d also send a big stack of Official Entry Forms to them. The schools would assign students to each company. The students would draw an ad on the paper and turn it in. The school would pick the best ads for each company and send them to us, and we’d pick the best ads out of all the ones they had received. We’d break it down into grades 1–3, grades 4–6, junior high and high school. We would publish the best ads for each company in the “category” part of a special section we ran, and then we’d have a “best overall ad” in each category.Let me explain newspaper ads for a second. Every ad a newspaper runs has an ad number on it. We use this for things like billing and in case the company wants to run the ad again, so if (say) Burger Haven does a Memorial Day ad that talks about their special summer hours and they run it every year, all we’ve got to do is feed the ad number into our system and it pops right up. We’ve got ads we’ve run for twenty years that we handle that way. Somewhere on the ad there’ll be the number.Well…we got one entry that was REALLY well done, way too well done for a student to have pulled off. It had an ad number on it, so we typed that number into the system and the exact same ad came up. The kid cut an ad out of the newspaper, stuck it on his entry form, ran the form through a copier so you couldn’t see he’d done what he did and turned it in. Yes, we called the school. I have no idea what the school did to him, but I hope it was ugly.","8,132 followers",Bill Poucher,506,289,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-example-of-plagiarism-youve-seen-as-a-teacher

He waited until after the new class would be assigned this project and then posted hisWhat the little genius hadn't planned on was that professor didn't assign the project this year. He only assigned one tiny piece of it—about five lines of code, instead of hundreds.We expected some students to copy the relevant lines of code from Jackson’s project. Whatever—it was only a few lines of code, and homework was only worth 10% of your grade. Plus, we wouldn't be able to even detect cheating here. The assignment was so short even identical code could be a coincidence.Know what can't be a coincidence? SubmittingThat's right. When all the other students were walking up to the class to turn in a single sheet of paper with a few lines of code, “Chris” submitted 10 pages of code, copied verbatim from the class forum, where the only change was his name. It was an astounding lack of common sense—only beaten by the second story.2.“Jason”, the Head TA that year, controlled the grade books. This was known to the students.Just before he's about to submit them to the professor, Jason gets an email from “Paul”, another TA:Dear Jason,Please change Gary Smith’s quiz and exam scores as follows: Quiz 1: …; Quiz 3: …; Quiz 5: …; Quiz 6: …; Quiz 7: …; Quiz: …; Exam 1: …PaulNo explanation given for why Paul was requesting a change to over half of the quizzes and exams.Hmm.

He did not want to fail, so he turned in this programming assignment with his signature attached. He stated that he knew that he could solve the problem but could not get his program to work.Down the primrose pathMy colleague was one of the kindest persons I ever knew. So, he invited the young man to go to the lab with us and let him show us his work. The lab had a combination lock. When we arrived, we waited for the student to open the lock.We waited. And, we waited.Finally, the student told us that with all of the stress, he had forgotten the combination. So Dwight, my colleague, opened the door for him. We went to a terminal and he sat down before it. Dwight asked him to log in to his account.We waited. And, we waited.Dwight turned on the terminal. This brought up the logon screen. There was no question that the student was nervous. So, the student then said he forgot his account name. Dwight gave it to him. He typed it in and then typed in his password. It was rejected.We waited. And, we waited.Finally, the student told us that with all of the stress, he had forgotten the password. So, Dwight went to another terminal to reset his password and gave the young man his new password.The moment of reckoningFinally!

There was no comment.Dwight and I got up and left.The consequenceWhen we returned to Dwight’s office, he made a call. It turned out that the student had transferred to our program with five computing courses taken at another college. He had insisted on starting in our third course, “Computer Organization and Programming”. Yet, he could not program. In fact, he didn’t know how to use a text editor.Dwight arranged for the student to drop the course.The lessonThis was some 40 years ago. I remember it like it happened yesterday.Dwight peeled the outer layers off of the onion so that the student could come to self-realization. Then, Dwight hit the reset button for the student - a fresh start.I have no idea what happened to that student. But, Dwight taught me the meaning of redemption.

I gave my AP Chemistry students a PowerPoint every day with a practice problem. Students had to turn in their work to the sub.One of the questions had to do with rate equations, and rate equations have a constant that is expressed using a lower case italicized ‘k’. When I returned to school, I noticed that every single paper had this equation solved for “L”.At first I thought I must have accidentally typed “L” instead of “k”. They are right next to each other on the keyboard after all. But I looked, and the PowerPoint said “k”.I was puzzled.So I looked at the work of each student. They were all precisely the same, including this phantom “L”.All except for one student - the best student in the class. She had written “k” … in cursive:but her pen had died in the smaller loop, making something that looked a fair bit like an LAll of the cheaters had followed suit.The next day in class, I asked them how they had solved for “L”. Students gave me glowing answers of how they had worked together so hard and found “L” through considerable effort.I played along.I praised their dedication. I extolled the virtues of their morality in making sure they each did their own work. They were practically patting themselves on the back.Then I put the PowerPoint back up.I said “Hmmm, that’s odd…I wonder how you all got L instead of k.” Then I showed them the “bad pen” answer (I had taken a picture and added it to the PowerPoint).The room got very quiet. I tried to talk to them. I tried to extol the virtues of honesty and integrity. I tried to tell them they were only cheating themselves.But I just couldn’t say anything.That class was never the same again. I was never the same again.After that I stopped assigning homework altogether. I tried various other strategies - oral defense, all classwork, participation stamping. You name it. But kids always seemed to find ways to cheat, and always seemed to do so with impunity. When I finally found a way to essentially prevent cheating (a combination of oral defense and random call-back / question selection), students just stopped doing homework altogether. Their grades plummeted, and I got in trouble for failing too many students.Sigh.So now I occasionally assign homework. I collect it and grade it if it’s done or not. But it isn’t worth much, and it rarely determines a student’s grade. I write Python programs that create unique versions of tests for each student so that they cannot cheat. I’m working on that for homework, too, but it’s a lot of work.I’m sad just thinking back on this incident - it was the day my innocence as a teacher died.

Instead, there were understandings, such as if you are late you will always be punished for it, the room will be cleaned and the desks aligned every day during homeroom, and when I’m talking, you’re not. In general, though, the whole class was built on common sense expectations. By the time they reach Middle School, kids know what good behavior looks like.For those who failed, I have what I call themes. Themes are short essays over a narrow topic. These topics in particular are pulled from the Marine Corps leadership traits, which were developed, as I say, to help young Marines make smart decision when there are no senior Marines around to help them. They are Judgement, Justice, Dependability, Initiative, Decisiveness, Tact, Integrity, Enthusiasm, Bearing, Unselfishness, Courage, Knowledge, Loyalty, and Endurance. When a kid messes up in my class, I assign them the appropriate theme. A kid might call another student stupid, “Jacob. You owe me a Loyalty.” Another might go to sleep in class - Initiative. Forgets their homework or to bring their supplies to class - Dependability. I have no rules, but I can give you a theme for just about anything. Immediately, their name goes on my board next to the theme.Of course, it isn’t as easy as just writing a simple paper. The paper is three paragraphs; the first tells me what that trait means, the second tells me how they failed to show it, and the third explains how they will show it in the future to never get in trouble. Then the real work starts. They write the paper, then I proofread it, give it back, and they have to rewrite it. This cycle keeps repeating until they turn in a paper free of errors. It’s more about getting them to think, and then repeat it to themselves over and over. I believe Pavlov would approve. After finally getting it right, which can take days, they get to take their name off my board and posted it to a clipboard I had hanging up called the “Lessons Learned Board”. Marines will appreciate that last part. You’d be shocked at how well this process has improved both my classroom management and my literacy test scores.That said, this answer is about cheaters.Well, once there were two girls named London and Rayanna. London earned a theme at one point for doing something wrong. She finished it and turned it in. A while later, Rayanna did something similar and was “awarded” the same theme. As I was reading Rayanna’s, my good teacher spidey sense started acting up. Déjà vu? Then it hit me…I started looking through the Lessons Learned and remembered London pulling hers out for reasons that I didn’t think about at the time. She was nosey and into things. What I did I care? Then I started comparing.Line by line, the exact same theme. Mr. Davis wasn’t happy. After the next class that I had them both, I pulled them over.“Well, girls, you’ll be happy to know that I finished Rayanna’s theme. It was really well written. What do you think of that?”They shyly smiled, not sure what to say, nor why I pulled them in just to tell them about this.“Rayanna, you did such a good job on it. Would you like to tell me how you did that?”“Ummm… I don’t know.” she said, looking down at her feet.“Oh, I see. I’m just such a really good teacher. Is that it?”“Yes, Sir.”“Right… and there is nothing else you girls want to tell me?”“No, Sir.”I paused and gave them time to make that their final answer.“I see. Well then Rayanna, why don’t you turn in your paper.”I handed her the paper and she went to turn it in. As she posted it to the Lesson’s Learned board, she saw that it wasn’t in her handwriting and paused. Education is a performance art, where your medium is psychology and the children don’t know they are the actors.“Is something wrong, Rayanna?” She said nothing. “Is there something you’d like to tell me now?”“I copied it from London.”Obviously it was bit late by now.“Yes, you did, and you thought I wouldn’t notice. That was very dishonest of you, both of you. I depend on you girls to be leaders, and I thought you had better judgment than to try to fool me. It also disappoints me that the two of you didn’t have the bravery to tell me what you did when I gave you all the chances you needed to tell the truth.”The two responded in unison.“I’m sorry, Mr. Davis.”“Don’t be sorry, girls. I’m not angry. You didn’t hurt my feelings. You just made a mistake. Unfortunately, mistakes have consequences. Fortunately, you can make up for this time.”A glimmer of hope from the two delinquents.“Yes, since you lied to me, you both owe me an Integrity. Since I couldn’t rely on you, you both owe me a Dependability. Since you made bad choices, you both owe me a Judgement, and since neither of you were brave enough to come clean, you both owe me a Courage. Do you both understand?”Their little eyes widened with shock at the gravity of what I had thrown at them.“Is there a problem, girls? If there is, we can just tell this to the principal and see if she has any solutions instead, maybe by telling your parents.”“No, Sir.”“Very good. I knew you would see it my way. I’ll expect your first drafts tomorrow morning.”“Yes, Sir.”And I never had a problem with the two of them again.","43,142 followers",Misha Firer,6.1K,1.3K,132.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-example-of-plagiarism-youve-seen-as-a-teacher

Usually I had at least a few question marks and false-cognate errors to correct, but this paper was oddly spot-on perfect. I read it through a couple of times looking for something I had to be missing. The student watched me with an unreadable smile on his face. I frowned and read it again.Something wasn’t hitting right. Something was strangely familiar about it, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. It was weirdly stilted and dated, nothing at all like something that would have been given to this student by a native speaker. The essay kept mentioning the same two names over and over, and that was odd too. Then I realized.I got up, walked past the student to the shelf of textbooks, and pulled out the Spanish text his professor favored. Yep, there were the two names, all through it, used over and over again for the generic male/female examples in every situation. I flipped toward the back of the book, where the passages about the two example people got longer and longer. And there it was.This idiot had skipped a couple of chapters ahead and stolen a passage out of his own textbook to submit as an original essay.I wanted to drop the book on his head and say, “Dumbass.” But I laughed, opened the book to that page, laid the perfectly-copied essay beside it and said, “Nice try, but I think she wants to see your own work.”(thinking... “dumbass”.)Edited to add:","7,467 followers",Sarthak Ganguly,7.2K,239,11.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-example-of-plagiarism-youve-seen-as-a-teacher

The shit hit the fan, parents were involved, and I was the subject of many complaints. The principal fired up and all hell broke loose.One argument by a parent was that their precious child was unfairly targeted as one of her friends had copied the assignment from a student the year before I started, hence the assignment was not photocopied.I just attached a photocopy of the previous assignments to the returned zero’s. I was pressured to change the marks, etc etc, but I told the parents and principal to take it further. I even told my principal: I'll go over his head and I'll go to the press about it as well.

35,"The worst case was also the first one I caught.I had given an assignment from Darwin’sThe worst case was also the first one I caught.I had given an assignment from Darwin’sI went to the person who was in charge of our writing tutors, and explained that something felt wrong to me about this paper. She was far more experienced with plagiarism than I was at the time. She read the first page of the paper along with my prompt, then googled one of the phrases within the essay. Out popped a full assignment. She printed it out. It was the exact same paper—word for word. The student had downloaded an essay from the internet.When we had class, I passed out every paper but his, as I wanted to speak with him after class. After class had ended, he asked me for the paper. I held up his paper with a zero in one hand and the photocopy of the internet essay in my other hand, and said nothing. He immediately understood and began to blame me for his actions. I didn’t give him enough time for the assignment. I didn’t explain the book in class. He didn’t understand the prompt. He wouldn’t have done this if I were a better instructor.I listened to all his complaints until he was done. I then said that plagiarism was an instant F for the assignment, and with his low grade average and poor class attendance, this would mean failure for the course. I then added that he had not once sought me out for help during the semester; he did not go to our tutors as I had checked, plus he never told me of a time problem with the writing, but got his papers in late. So he should expect an F in the class.He spoke to my director who upheld my decision to give him an F for the paper, but asked that I try not to fail him for the course. I insisted that he go to tutoring and get his papers in on time, plus attend class regularly. He did comply. He was able to pass with a low C.Whenever I suspect a student of plagiarism, I pay attention to the language of the writing. Some sections may be plagiarized and others may be organic writing. If the writing feels wrong or false, I google it. I also use Safe Assign.Students also can use sites that can alter a plagiarized paper into something more palatable so a busy teacher can miss these things. However, I find plagiarism always gets caught—if not by me, it will get caught by someone else. I had another student who probably plagiarized papers, but I missed it. The instructor who had her after me did not, and showed me her work. She wondered how I missed it. Sometimes it happens. As we saw with the current Mrs. Trump, people always find out, and the loss of respect is just the beginning.Thanks for the A2A, McKayla.",0 followers,Laura Hancock,1.7K,4.6K,28.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-example-of-plagiarism-youve-seen-as-a-teacher

It normally wasn’t too hard – plagiarites tend to not be the most hardworking students, so their tracks were fairly easy to uncover: a sudden font change here, a jarring sentence there, overly-technical or sophisticated segments… A quick Google search of a few key lines and the plagiarized source would soon be found.Then one day I was sitting in front of a paper, at a complete dead end.
