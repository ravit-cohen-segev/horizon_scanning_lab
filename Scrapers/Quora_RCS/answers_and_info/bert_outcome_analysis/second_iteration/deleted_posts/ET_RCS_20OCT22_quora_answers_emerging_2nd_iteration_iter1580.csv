A 2010 survey[1]by The Physicians Foundation found that 40% of doctors planned to drop out of patient care in the next 1-3 years, either by retiring or seeking a nonclinical job.Doctors who decide to stop seeing patients are usually glad they did -- and in many cases, they're earning as much money as they did in clinical medicine, according to Steve Babitsky. Babitsky is an attorney who runs SEAK Inc., a Falmouth, Massachusetts-based company that trains physicians, including those who want to switch careers.""Most, if not all, of the doctors who switch to a nonclinical career are happier,"" Babitsky said, adding that replacing clinical income is easier than you might think. ""Look at what you're earning per hour of work,"" he said. ""You may be getting less than plumbers, electricians, and landscapers.""As sobering as that may be, don't take a switch lightly. Finding a new career is a big decision that requires a lot of soul-searching, said Heather Fork, MD, a physician coach at Doctor's Crossing in Austin, Texas. When deciding, ""it's important to create some space in one's busy life for something new to come in,"" she said.Dr. Fork added that in many nonclinical jobs, it's possible to continue clinical work on a part-time basis. Indeed, some jobs require keeping one foot in clinical medicine. Also, clinical assignments, such as working for a locum tenens agency, can provide extra income as you build up your new career, she said.Here are 16 options for second careers, but before we get to them, let's first examine what kinds of doctors switch careers -- and for what reasons.Who Switches, and Why?Doctors have different reasons for leaving clinical care, depending on the stage of their career, their gender, and their specialty.Joseph Kim, MD, who runs a Website for doctors called Nonclinical Jobs, said physicians tend to leave clinical medicine at distinct stages in their careers. In the first wave, a small group of young doctors leaves clinical medicine right after medical school or residency, or just when they start practicing.Dr. Kim is one of them. Graduating from an internal medicine residency, he realized that he didn't want to practice. He instead worked for a consumer health company and then for a continuing medical education (CME) company, MCM Education in Newtown, Pennsylvania, rising to his current position of president.Typically, these doctors didn't plan to leave medicine. ""They don't tend to have an entrepreneurial interest,"" Dr. Kim said, ""so they might go into medical writing, medical communications, or pharma at various levels.""On the other hand, another group of newly minted doctors never intended to practice medicine at all. ""They might get a dual MD/MBA degree, which has really flourished,"" Dr. Kim said. ""They can be very ambitious and very driven, and are willing to put in long hours."" These young doctors might focus on financial careers, such as consulting or raising venture capital.Most doctors who leave clinical medicine, however, do so in mid-career, when they're in their late 30s or 40s -- the second wave, if you will. ""These physicians have been in practice for a number of years and are getting burned out. They tend to be very disenchanted about the changes in healthcare,"" Dr. Kim said. ""They want to find greener grass. They might go into pharma, health insurance, managed care, or health resource utilization.""But the transition into a new career can be very difficult. ""They've spent much of their career practicing medicine and haven't been developing other skill sets,"" he said. ""It's hard for these doctors to convince a prospective employer that they have something to offer besides being a clinician.""A third group of doctors switches jobs at or near retirement age. In this case, ""someone age 50 or 55 years decides to take on a completely different career,"" Dr. Kim said. This strategy, called an ""encore career,"" involves something the physician may always have been interested in, such as painting or working outdoors. ""This isn't the predominate trend, but it became bigger in the recession,"" he said.Career changing also differs by gender. Women are more likely to exit clinical medicine to deal with family responsibilities. They may work part-time or not at all while their children are young. When their children are older, however, they have a chance to rethink their careers and may choose a job outside of clinical practice. A study[2] by the American Medical Group Association found that 44% of female physicians were working part-time in 2011, twice the level of male physicians.No one has pinpointed which specialties change careers the most, but we do know which specialties report the most burnout, which is a factor in career changes. A 2013 Medscape survey[3]found that the highest incidence of burnout was among physicians in emergency medicine, critical care medicine, anesthesiology, and general surgery, as well as in all major primary care fields except pediatrics.Specialty can also be an impediment to career change. Primary care physicians with high medical-school debts and low practice income may be less willing to exit clinical care because they can't afford to lose the income. On the other hand, specialists with high incomes are likely to have a harder time finding nonclinical work that matches their current income.Despite the risks, however, plenty of doctors still decide to make the leap. Are you ready to consider something new? If so, here are the 16 options for second careers.1. Move Into Hospital AdministrationHospital administration is a long-standing option for physicians, and the opportunities are expanding as hospitals try to align more closely with their doctors. For a practicing physician who is no longer feeling challenged by patient care, here's a chance to make a big difference across a whole institution and still earn a good living.Although chief medical officer is the traditional role of physicians, more key positions are opening up. These include chief operations officer; chief integration officer; chief administration officer; and chief strategy, innovation, or transformation officer.Typically, any of these career paths first involves serving on hospital committees for a few years. Once appointed, you may be able to rise through the ranks. But you'll need to deal with business issues that you might not be familiar with, and you'll run the risk of having some colleagues who won't view you as one of them anymore.Philippa Kennealy, MD, became Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, in California in the late 1990s. She took the traditional route -- serving on hospital committees in order to build her reputation. A practicing family physician, she initially volunteered for a committee because she wanted to help out after an earthquake hit the area. Then she began to relish the role. ""I realized I was unhappy in my own practice,"" she said. ""I decided there was a lot more that I could contribute in administration."" She initially left her practice in 1996 to become Hospital Medical Director before later becoming CEO.Dr. Kennealy thinks her experience as a practicing doctor made her a better executive. ""Another physician really does understand the physician's point of view,"" she said. On the other hand, ""it's a tricky role, because there are physicians who think you've moved over to the dark side.""There are many opportunities for administrators these days. Eight in 10 healthcare organizations have at least one doctor in senior management, according to a 2010 survey.[4]However, whereas multihospital health systems and academic medical centers were most likely to have several physicians at the top, more than one half of community hospitals did not have any physicians in key roles.As Dr. Kennealy has experienced, MD or DO leaders can bridge the gap between the administration and physicians, the hospital's most important resource. A 2011 survey[5] revealed that 56% of physicians on hospital staffs didn't trust the administration as partners because of a lack of physician leadership, and 50% cited too little communication with the administration.Physician leadership is linked to the more highly regarded hospitals. A 2011 research study[6] found that specialty hospitals headed by physicians rank about 25% higher onAt many hospitals, however, you won't be able to stop practicing altogether. A 2011 survey[7] found that more than two thirds of physician executives at hospitals continue to see patients, even if it's only half a day per week, and more than one half said it was a job requirement.Pluses:Minuses:2. Become a Physician Advisor at Your HospitalOne job in hospital administration that has seen a lot of growth recently is that of the physician advisor. The position involves working closely with doctors to improve documentation of hospital charges, as well as making sure they adhere to quality and safety regulations. You may also interface with Medicare's recovery audit contractors and other regulators.Once a part-time position for physicians nearing retirement, the physician advisor is now usually a full-time gig filled by doctors in mid-career. Dr. Heather Fork, the career coach, expects a lot of growth in this field. Although only one quarter of hospitals currently have the position, most will have it in the near future, she said. Growth is driven by the need for alignment with physicians, the shift to Accountable Care Organizations, and increasing use of performance data.Physician advisors are chosen from within the hospital staff; these folks have earned their colleagues' respect and understand evidence-based medicine. ""The physician advisor is a clinical educator, diplomat, and tightrope walker,"" Dr. Fork said. ""This role is only for a certain type of physician who is able to handle conflict and deal with different personality types.""Bernard H. Ravitz, MD, has been physician advisor at the 300-bed MedStar Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore for 10 years. Beforehand, he had served as an emergency physician at the hospital for 15 years.A key part of his job is to monitor admissions. ""If even one hospital day is denied, that means we're still caring for the beneficiary but not getting paid for the care we're providing,"" he said. Working closely with physicians, he sees himself as an educator, helping with documentation and offering feedback to reduce denials and improve care.""You have to be able to get along with the medical staff,"" Dr. Ravitz said. ""You have to have people skills.""Dr. Ravitz was a speaker at the 11th Annual Physician Advisor Summit in March and is a founding member of the American College of Physician Advisors, which was launched in May. He said there are roughly 50-100 founding members out of hundreds of physicians in the field. The college plans to provide assistance to doctors interested in this career.Pluses:Minuses:3. Start a Practice Management ConsultancyThousands of physicians have started practice management consultancy firms, based on a skill they learned when they ran a practice, such as coding, claims processing, or practice efficiency. ""This is good for people who are self-starters,"" Babitsky said.For example, David Zielske, MD, an interventional radiologist in Tennessee, founded a company that addressed the difficult coding requirements of his specialty. ""The coding for interventional radiology is unusually complex and error-prone,"" he said, but he enjoyed the challenge. ""I've always had a passion for coding.""In 2000, Dr. Zielske took his coding skills and cofounded ZHealth in Brentwood, Tennessee, to help physicians and hospitals deal with interventional radiology coding. For a while, he operated out of his home and had to continue practicing for a few years to keep up his income. The transition was ""a very expensive, long-term process,"" he said. ""You can't just quit and think you can be successful right away.""The company has prospered since then, branching out into coding for vascular and cardiac care, and Dr. Zielske has also written books, hosted webinars, and given speeches and seminars on coding.Some physicians who start consulting firms keep practicing medicine. For example, L. Neal Freeman, MD, a practicing ophthalmologist in Melbourne, Florida, is President of CPR Analysts, coding and physician reimbursement analysts.The work can build on basic skills learned in clinical care. ""Consulting is like the problem-solving you do in medicine,"" Dr. Fork said. ""You have to take a project from beginning to conclusion.""Pluses:4. Become a Career CoachLots of physicians stay busy these days serving as career coaches for their colleagues. And considering the high percentage of doctors in The Physicians Foundation survey who reported that they wanted to change careers, demand for this new field may not yet be fully tapped.In addition to counseling on career change, coaches help physicians upgrade their current careers, brush up on their management skills, and develop new sources of income for their practices. They may work with clients one-on-one, speak to small groups, or give seminars and speeches.There are even courses and certification programs for career coaches, who can earn six figures once they've established themselves.Dr. Kennealy left her post as hospital CEO in 2002 to start her own coaching company in Los Angeles. First she taught leadership skills to physician executives, department chiefs, and medical staff presidents. Now, in a business called The Entrepreneurial MD, she coaches physicians who want to start their own business. ""It was a natural fit for me, because it allowed me back into the helping relationship that I enjoyed when I practiced medicine,"" she said.Dr. Fork decided to become a career coach after leaving her dermatology practice in 2004, and Francine Gaillour, MD, has been working in the coaching field for 18 years. In the past five years, Dr. Gaillour has coached more than 300 physicians in one-on-one and group settings, as well as through teleseminars, according to her Website.In 2003, Dr. Gaillour founded the Physician Coaching Institute, which has graduated more than 50 certified physician development coaches, including Dr. Kennealy. Enrollees take a six-month program that includes 12 live training teleseminars, other coaching sessions, and modules on specific skills.Pluses:Minuses:5. Work With Computer TechnologyIf you have expertise in computer technology, you'll have a variety of careers to choose from, including advising an electronic medical record (EMR) company, working for a hospital, creating software applications, and perhaps even launching a technology start-up company.In the flawed launches of EMRs and other systems in hospitals, physicians have blamed non-MD chief information officers (CIOs) for not understanding their needs. As a result, hospitals have started hiring physicians as chief medical information officers (CMIOs). These doctors serve as a liaison to the medical staff and apply a clinician's insights into developing computer technology.The Health Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) recently stated[8] that the number of physicians who reported working with a CMIO has almost doubled, from 22% in 2012 to 40% in 2013. ""When you think about the physicians and CMIOs coming on, they bring in this culture [of] connectivity and analytics,"" Lorren Petit, Vice President of Market Research for HIMSS, toldA model for this approach is John D. Halamka, MD, who has been CIO at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston for many years. He also writes the Geek Doctor blog and puts in time practicing emergency medicine.Similarly, physicians can offer useful input into improving EMR design. A company called Modernizing Medicine, based in Boca Raton, Florida, seeks to bridge the gap between doctors and software engineers by teaching physicians computer coding and having them design specialty-specific EMRs. The physicians even go on the road to market their product, even as they continue to practice medicine.Beyond EMRs, physicians can play a role in developing a variety of new software applications, ranging from at-home patient monitoring to providing doctors with quick access to best practices. For example, Thomas Osborne, MD, a radiologist in Vista, California, has been reading scans for vRad, a large telemedicine company. Recently, he was named the company's medical director of informatics. To demonstrate his abilities and get the job, he did IT work and volunteered for a company project. ""My successful involvement has in turn put me in a position to be involved in other areas of the rapidly expanding business,"" he said.Some physicians dropped out of medicine to work on software even before they completed their residency. Scott Zimmerman, MD, CEO of""People told me I was crazy,"" he said. ""I only had $10,000 in the bank and nearly $200,000 in student loans, with a six-figure salary just in reach."" But the new company raised $2 million from several investors.Pluses:Minuses:6. Review Insurance ClaimsThere's a growing demand for physicians to help payers with utilization review (UR). ""The health insurance industry is just booming right now,"" said Steve Babitsky, citing the mandate under the Affordable Care Act requiring all Americans to have coverage.Although some physicians may view this as working for the wrong side, it's ""actually a chance to do good,"" Dr. Fork said. ""Your role has to do with stopping overuse of services within the healthcare system and helping to provide quality care for value.""The advantages are that you can use your diagnostic skills as a physician; you're often able to work out of your home; and, if you work full-time, it may be possible to make as much money as you did seeing patients, although many UR physicians work part-time.Heidi Moawad, MD, a neurologist in Cleveland, served for several years as a UR physician, working part-time out of her home while raising her young children. Working with a radiology review company that contracted with several health insurers, she dealt with preauthorization requests for radiology from fellow neurologists.Contrary to her trepidations going into the job, she felt under no pressure to deny payments and felt little resistance from the physicians whose requests she was reviewing. In fact, many of them would even ask for her guidance. ""They would tell me, 'This is the story; what do you think?'"" she recalled. ""When I said the test was unnecessary, they were actually relieved."" The job helped her get on the Practice Guidelines Committee of the American Academy of Neurology.When her kids got older, Dr. Moawad switched to a teaching job, but she looks back fondly on her UR career. However, she thinks UR physicians are now under increasing pressure to closely follow practice guidelines rather than follow their own reasoning.Amy E. Odgers, MD, an internist in Chicago, also switched from clinical practice to UR work. Initially she worked in a call center, handling physicians whose charges were being challenged. ""At times, the work can be contentious,"" she said. ""Doctors don't like to be questioned about why they're ordering tests.""After 9 years of reviewing claims, she now has a new position at the same company, studying ways to improve workflow. Working just 20 hours a week, she said she doesn't make as much money as clinical care physicians, but she isn't in debt either. Plus, she has time to pursue gardening and ceramics. ""I love the balance I have between work and other things,"" she said from a cell phone while in her garden.Pluses:Minuses:7. Work at a Management Consulting FirmA management consulting company might be a good fit for ambitious physicians who like problem solving and working in teams, but expect to put in long hours and don't mind having to be away from home a lot.Many doctors work for such companies as Accenture, Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte, McKinsey & Company, and Milliman. The work involves making in-depth studies on behalf of clients that include hospitals, government, and insurers. Salaries at the top firms start at around $150,000, with the chance to earn raises each year.Consulting firms often recruit doctors directly out of medical school, but also hire them in mid-career. McKinsey has a Webpage to answer questions from physicians and other people with advanced degrees looking for jobs there.Dr. Fork said assignments can last months, during which consultants usually work on-site for most of the week. ""In many cases, you're traveling four days a week and putting in long hours,"" she said. This makes it impossible to work in clinical practice even at a minimal level.In 2001, Michael P. Ennen, then a senior medical student who had accepted a position with McKinsey, wrote an article[10] about the career inHe emphasized the need to adjust to a team approach. ""To be successful, physicians must modify their expectations about their role in a hierarchy, their individual input, and the service being provided to clients,"" he wrote.Pluses:Minuses:8. Become a Financial PlannerPhysicians who are successful in financial planning can use some of the skills they honed as clinicians and attain previous earning levels, but building the business involves hard work over several years.Joel Greenwald, MD, was a practicing internist in the Minneapolis area for 11 years before switching to financial planning. ""I was in my mid-30s, and I said to myself, 'I can't feel like this for 30 more years,'"" he recalled. He was always interested in financial planning, which he says is a lot like practicing medicine: Clients come to him with problems; he asks questions, comes up with solutions, and develops a program for them.But the switch took years. First came the required classes and an exam to become a certified financial planner (CFP), which he completed while still in practice. Then he quit practicing to launch his new business, Greenwald Wealth Management. But during the first three years, he wasn't allowed to represent himself as a CFP and didn't have many customers.When he could finally hang his CFP shingle, Dr. Greenwald realized that his best clientele would be other physicians. Very focused on their work, they often don't have time to tend to their finances. ""Free time away from your practice is a precious commodity,"" he said. And because of the MD after his name, Dr. Greenwald could gain their trust, which is necessary when handling someone else's money.Dr. Greenwald has worked hard to get new clients, writing articles on his new profession in major publications and speaking before physician groups. But even with all of the effort he's put into his second career, he thinks the work is a lot simpler than running a practice. ""I serve 80 households of clients, and I have two employees,"" he said. ""All I need to do is make them happy."" Now that he has a busy practice, ""I make more money than I would as a general internist,"" he said.Pluses:Minuses:9. Work for a Venture Capital CompanyWant a chance to earn millions? Then take a closer look at a second career at a venture capital firm. There, you'll often find greater challenges and even greater risks, with a shot at a huge income if you succeed.In this line of work, physicians closely analyze start-up companies in healthcare -- in such areas as software, drugs, and medical devices -- and help determine whether the venture capital company should invest in them. The work is best suited for doctors with strong analytical skills, an aptitude for finances and statistics, and a willingness to take risks on largely untested start-ups.Companies are often looking for young physicians with MBA degrees, but they also hire physicians who have proven their chops as consultants. Doctors can work full-time directly for the venture capital company or be hired as a freelance consultant.Physicians even start their own venture capital companies. Marlene R. Krauss, MD, left an ophthalmology practice many years ago to start KBL Healthcare Ventures in Manhattan, after working for 8 years at an investment bank, according to the company Website.Dr. Fork said physicians consulting with venture capital firms earn $300-$500 per hour. Working directly for a firm pays about $150,000 a year for entry-level positions, whereas some in the upper echelons can potentially earn millions.Pluses:Minuses:10. Get Involved in Retail or ManufacturingSome physicians enter businesses that have little or nothing to do with healthcare and do quite well, thanks in part to skills and temperament learned in practice. In business, ""you need to be a smart, hard-working person who can stay focused,"" Babitsky said. ""Those are things that physicians do quite well.""Babitsky recalled a doctor who opened a bagel shop near him on Cape Cod. It was a shrewd move, because there were still no bagel shops in the area. The doctor worked hard and the business flourished. It wasn't a sure thing, because many restaurants and other retail businesses fail, especially when the economy sags.Similarly, Daniel E. Kohn, MD, an emergency physician in Baltimore, switched from practicing in an emergency department to running a manufacturing company full-time. Like many physicians, he had for many years been investing in real estate, buying old buildings and rehabbing them, when in 1997 he came across a dilapidated factory.The factory housed a shirt company that was about to go out of business. Dr. Kohn decided to buy the company, called Aetna Shirt, and bring it out of bankruptcy. ""It was kind of a fire sale,"" he said. ""The price was reasonable, and there was a book of business already there.""As an emergency physician, Dr. Kohn had experience bringing back patients from near death, but rescuing a whole manufacturing concern proved to be a greater challenge. ""I didn't understand how relentless the financial needs of this kind of enterprise can be,"" he said, ""but I was determined to make it work.""He left the emergency department and introduced a new product he knew intimately: white lab coats. ""I never found a decent lab coat,"" he said. He set about producing a sturdier product that could also be custom-tailored to create a more fashionable look. The lab coat business, called On Call Medical Coats, now makes up 70%-80% of sales.After 17 years in business, Dr. Kohn still hasn't recovered his full investment, but the company is firmly in the black. To find customers, he used to go to 20 medical meetings a year, but he cut back that schedule as business improved. ""It's still a work in progress,"" he said. ""I want to continue to grow this company.""Pluses:Minuses:11. Get a Job in the Pharma SectorPhysicians can easily develop a side income by speaking about a drug to colleagues on behalf of a pharmaceutical company, but full-time work in pharma is more difficult to obtain. Although a few physicians work on the marketing side, most are involved in research and development. Even here, the field is hard to break into, in part owing to a complex set of rules and regulations not found anywhere else in medicine.Experts on pharma trends point to somewhat greater demand for full-time physicians in prescription-heavy specialties, such as oncology, cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, and psychiatry. It also helps to have experience with drug trials or to have worked for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a few years. FDA pay is quite low, but the experience can be a springboard to a career at a drug-maker, where salaries start at $130,000 and top out at about $500,000 plus bonuses.Another way to share in the storied wealth of the pharma industry is to start an independent company that contracts with drug companies. For example, former plastic surgeon Mike McLaughlin, MD, cofounded Peloton Advantage, a New Jersey-based medical communications company that works with pharma, biotech, and medical device companies.Dr. McLaughlin also runs a side company, Physicians Renaissance Network, which provides information for physicians seeking a career change. ""I quit clinical care all at once,"" he recalls. ""I wouldn't recommend doing that, because it's important to test the waters to make sure it's a good fit.""Pluses:Minuses:12. Become a Physician RecruiterOne unusual but financially rewarding job is to recruit physicians for various jobs, such as clinical research, hospital employment, and group practice. As with many other jobs that require interaction with a lot with doctors, it helps to be a physician and understand what makes them tick.John Goldener, MD, runs a company that recruits doctors for drug trials. Although it took years of hard work to get Goldener Executive Search Associates, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, off the ground, he said he's now making more money than he did in clinical medicine.In 2000, Dr. Goldener traded his lab coat for a position with an executive search company that worked with pharma companies. It meant giving up clinical work, because ""if a client calls and wants to talk to me, they don't want to hear that I'm seeing patients,"" he said. Three years later, he founded his own company, but a noncompete clause in his contract meant he couldn't solicit any of his old employer's clients. ""I had to start at the bottom,"" he said.That meant making cold calls to pharma executives asking to do their physician searches and driving up to New Jersey to meet with them. ""I'm rather introverted, so I had to learn how to call people one after another,"" he said. It took him six months before he landed his first search.As with any job that involves working with physicians, it helps to be one of them and demonstrate that you understand medical concepts, Dr. Goldener added.Pluses:Minuses:13. Become a Freelance WriterDo you like to write? If so, and you can prove that you have a talent for it, there are countless clinical writing and editing opportunities with pharmaceutical companies, marketing agencies, CME contractors, quality and performance improvement initiatives, and medical publications. In most cases, the work is done on a freelance basis, which means you have to build up your business.Once you have an established set of clients, however, your income can reach primary care levels. Dr. Fork said freelancers' average income is $70,000-$130,000 a year, and the starting salary for in-house clinical writers ranges from $75,000 to $180,000; the higher end of the range is usually reserved for those with an advanced medical degree.""If you have the skills, it's not a big transitional hurdle,"" Dr. Fork added. Characteristics of good medical writing include thorough research, accuracy, logical organization, clear thinking, and readability, according to the American Medical Writers Association.This has been a growing field. According to a report[11] by CenterWatch, which studies the pharma industry, the medical writing market more than doubled in value from 2003 to 2008, increasing to almost $700 million. CenterWatch reported that pharmaceutical companies cut many in-house writing jobs, meaning there's more work available for freelancers.Diane W. Shannon, MD, MPH, a freelance healthcare writer in Brookline, Massachusetts, writes on performance improvement in healthcare as well as other topics. Her exit from general internal medicine in the early 1990s was an act of ""self-preservation,"" she recalled. ""I was less immune than others to the stresses of practicing medicine.""First, she worked as editor and staff writer for a medical communications company for three years. As a freelancer, she's making more money than when she was working in clinics. ""Leaving a relatively low-paying job probably made it easier to walk away from clinical medicine,"" she said, adding that she uses a variety of medical skills in writing, such as interviewing patients, having to be well-organized, and breaking down very complicated material.Mandy Armitage, MD, also moved from medicine to writing. In an article on Dr. Fork's Website, Doctor's Crossing, she said she stopped practicing sports medicine and rehabilitation after a year, and ""I haven't missed it a bit."" She initially enrolled in a six-week online writing course and then started a freelance company, collecting such assignments as conference coverage, medical news, and feature stories.""What I love most about freelance medical writing is that I cover fields outside of my own specialty, so I'm always learning something new,"" she wrote.

Produce CME PresentationsDoctors can help organize and write presentations for companies that host CME for doctors and other health professionals, an industry that generates more than $2 billion in annual sales.These companies must meet a demanding set of requirements from the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), such as documenting their target audience, stating course objectives, explaining how the course fills gaps in knowledge, and testing participants afterwards.Talented doctors can rise fast in the CME industry. For example, Dr. Kim joined MCM Education, a small CME company in Pennsylvania, in 2006 and is now President, making an income similar to that of physicians in clinical practice.Dr. Kim said he brought skills in both writing and computer software to the company. As an MIT undergraduate, he wanted to combine his interest in technology with population-based health, so he enrolled in medical school and trained in internal medicine but didn't go into practice.""I just felt I could apply my skill set better somewhere else,"" he said. So he went to work at a consumer health company, where he helped build some computer-based education modules. But he preferred writing for doctors, which brought him to CME. He's currently studying for an MBA. ""A lot of doctors have to learn executive skills to be successful in business,"" he said.According to the ACCME's 2012 Annual Report, the latest available, the total income for accredited CME providers exceeded $2.4 billion in 2012, a 5% increase over 2011. Accredited CME providers differentiate themselves from medical communications companies that work with pharmaceutical companies to provide seminars to doctors. Although CME companies still derive some income from pharma companies, the ACCME report said those payments fell by more than 10% in 2012.Pluses:Minuses:15. Become a TeacherMany doctors dream of becoming teachers, and for a lot of them, it's a good fit in many ways. Physicians know how to talk to patients about complicated medical concepts in simple terms, and they have had to speak in front of small groups. However, opportunities are limited to part-time work at colleges, and the pay doesn't match what can be made in clinical care.Despite the financial drawbacks, doctors have a surprisingly strong interest in teaching. In the 2011 Medscape Physician Compensation Report,[12] physicians who wanted to drop clinical medicine chose teaching as one of their top three alternatives. Indeed, teaching is regarded as a relatively stable refuge from the disruptive modern workplace. Among 14 categories in the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index,[13] teachers rank second.Dr. Moawad was satisfied with the move from her UR job to working as a college science teacher. After 4 years in the job, ""I'm really, really happy,"" she said. The work draws on her skills dealing with patients. ""Doctors are used to talking to people who don't know about the subject matter and have a limited interest in wanting to learn more about it,"" she said.She's an adjunct professor at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio, teaching two courses on human physiology and global health. The hourly pay is about the same as in clinical practice, but she works just 10-25 hours a week. Only full-time professors get 40 hours, she said, adding that fewer hours are a good fit for physicians raising a family or in semi-retirement. Her work schedule also puts her in sync with her school-age kids' vacation schedules.""College teaching is the best teaching opportunity,"" Dr. Moawad said. Teaching high school science pays too little, and medical school also isn't an option, she said. Dr. Moawad, who served on the faculty at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, said there aren't any nonclinical teaching jobs for physicians who are not full-time faculty.Pluses:Minuses:16. Start an 'Encore Career'The ""encore career,"" the job switch made by older doctors, which Dr. Kim explained earlier, typically doesn't pay very well but may answer some personal calling. Dr. McLaughlin said he knows of plastic surgeons who have taken up sculpture full-time, and Dr. Moawad knows a physician who quit practicing to open an aromatherapy and jewelry shop.The Medscape Physician Compensation Report included responses of ""chef"" and ""musician,"" which could represent doctors beginning encore careers. Steve Babitsky said one of his clients always wanted to work in the outdoors, so he found a job as a park ranger. ""The job only paid $30,000-$40,000 a year, but that's what he really wanted to do.""Michael Alberti, MD, gave up a job as an emergency physician in Scottsdale, Arizona, to become a portrait photographer. Working in a busy emergency department, ""I was losing my love of medicine,"" he said. Then two things happened: He got a digital camera as a gift in 2001, and his wife had a baby four years later. ""It rocked my world,"" he said.Having already mastered Photoshop, he began taking lots of pictures of his new baby, and within two years he had opened a portrait studio. By 2009, he had acquired a steady customer base in his affluent hometown, and he cut back on his emergency department shifts. In 2010, he was diagnosed with cancer, and by the next year he had quit medicine altogether.He isn't making as much money as in clinical medicine, but his wife, also a doctor, makes up for that. ""Giving up my old salary was not easy,"" he said, ""but I don't do this to make money. I do this because of the love I have for it.""Pluses:Minuses:","115,011 followers",Daveed Phoenix,691,9.9K,160M,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-can-I-do-with-an-MD-without-a-residency-I-want-to-take-a-year-off-before-residency

7,"Early Decision Can Help You Edge Out Your CompetitionByDoes getting early decision mean an automatic entry into college? This article helps you find out the truth about ED applicants.There's a lot of hype floating around that some schools accept almost all of their incoming freshmen from their pool of Early Decision (ED) applicants. While it's true thatEarly Decision Can Help You Edge Out Your CompetitionByDoes getting early decision mean an automatic entry into college? This article helps you find out the truth about ED applicants.There's a lot of hype floating around that some schools accept almost all of their incoming freshmen from their pool of Early Decision (ED) applicants. While it's true thatRealistically, all schools only have so many openings set aside for the incoming class, and they want to give those spots to the best candidates possible. If they give away every bed they have by December, then they won't have room to accept the Colorado State Spelling Bee Champion who applies in February. Some schools hedge their bets just as some students do when applying to college. They may defer a portion of their ED applicants so they can eyeball what comes across their application desks later in the year.Early admission by the numbersIt’s generally true that many of the most exclusive schools are the ones most likely to offer Early Decision admission options, and research supports the buzz that you stand a better chance of scoring a coveted spot by applying early. On average, 25 to 50 percent of the freshman classes at these schools come from ED applicants. (Those numbers could be higher, depending on the school.) However, that means that come springtime, although there’s still another 50 to 75 percent of the class to accept, you’ll be competing against a much larger pool of applicants and your chances of getting accepted are lower. So, statistically speaking, aThere are a few schools who accept a very large majority of their incoming class from their early admission applicants, and the only way to know if your choice school is among those is to do your research. Ask the school directly about their admission statistics to get a better picture of your chances of acceptance and discuss what this means with your school guidance counselor. In some cases, an Early Decision application really may be the only way to edge out your competition. Before you send off that paperwork, make sure one more time it’s what you want since an early acceptance under ED means you have entered into a binding agreement to attend that school and you can’t apply anywhere else.Keep in mind as well that some schools, Ivy League included, are starting to do away with early application options altogether.Early action and financial aidIf you’re like most students, finances probably play an important role in making your final decision about where to apply. As part of your decision process about ED, you should meet with your choice school's financial aid office as early as your junior year. You’ll be able to get an idea if the school is an economically viable choice or if it’s just too far out of the ballpark.Ask your parents to bring their tax forms so they can get an idea of their likely Expected Family Contribution, and you can find out ahead of time what financial aid you’re likely to receive. By checking it out early on, you can avoid the wrenching disappointment of getting in but not being able to go. Acceptance decisions for early action applicants show up in your mailbox months before you hear from the Financial Aid office.Early admission and youSo what does all this mean? Should you apply for Early Decision at a school that you’re considering? Not unless you are 100 percent absolutely, positively certain that it’s THE school that you want to attend above all others. However, just because you really want to go there doesn’t mean you should feel like you have to apply early, either. Early application is really only a good tactic when you and the school are truly well matched. In a nutshell, don’t waste their time or yours if you’re not really sure it’s your top choice or if there is a strong likelihood you won’t get accepted.If you decide to go for it, give your all to that crucial essay by emphasizing your strengths and vividly describing what makes the school a perfect fit for you. Schools that have Early Decision options want to accept ED applicants because they are usually the most qualified and most sought-after students, and they are students who are communicating that by applying as ED, they really want to get in to that school. Admission committees look favorably upon excellent candidates who desire nothing more than to be a part of their student body. If it’s a competitive school, you fit the profile, and you really have your heart set on it, then by all means, apply Early Decision and better your chances of being able to call it your alma mater.Early Decision & Early ActionThe benefits and drawbacks of applying earlyEarly decision (ED) and early action (EA) plans can be beneficial to students — but only to those who have thought through their college options carefully and have a clear preference for one institution.Early decision versus early actionEarly decision plans are binding — a student who is accepted as an ED applicant must attend the college. Early action plans are nonbinding — students receive an early response to their application but do not have to commit to the college until the normal reply date of May 1. Counselors need to make sure that students understand this key distinction between the two plans.Approximately 450 colleges have early decision or early action plans, and some have both. Some colleges offer a nonbinding option calledED plans have come under fire as unfair to students from families with low incomes, since they do not have the opportunity to compare financial aid offers. This may give an unfair advantage to applicants from families who have more financial resources.ED applicantsEA applicantsWho should apply early?Applying to an ED or EA plan is most appropriate for a student who:Applying to an ED or EA plan is not appropriate for a student who:Encourage students who want to apply early to fill out NACAC'sThe benefits of applying earlyFor a student who has a definite first-choice college, applying early has many benefits besides possibly increasing the chance of getting in.

This is not always true. Colleges vary in the proportion of the class admitted early and in the percentage of early applicants they admit.Higher admission rates for ED applicants may correlate to stronger profiles among candidates choosing ED. Students should ask the admission office whether their institution's admission standards differ between ED and regular applicants, and then assess whether applying early makes sense given their own profile.The ethics of applying early decisionThe Common Application and some colleges' application forms require the student applying under early decision, as well as the parent and counselor, to sign an ED agreement form spelling out the plan's conditions.Make it clear in your school handbook and at college planning events that your policy for early-decision applications is to send the student's final transcript to one college only: anything else is unethical.Keep in mindPrint out and share theRelated DownloadsA college-admissions edge for the wealthy: Early decisionByNathan Hanshew, 17, a senior at Washington Latin Public Charter School, is embraced by the head of the school, Martha C. Cutts, after learning that he received a full-ride scholarship to attend George Washington University. GW President Steven Knapp, at lower right, visited the school March 17 to make the surprise announcement. (Logan Werlinger/GW Today)Many of the nation’s top colleges draw more than 40 percent of their incoming freshmen through an early-application system that favors the wealthy, luring students to commit to enroll if they get in and shutting out those who want the chance to compare offers of grants and scholarships.The binding-commitment path known as “early decision” fills roughly half of the freshman seats at highly ranked Vanderbilt, Emory, Northwestern and Tufts universities, as well as Davidson, Bowdoin, Swarthmore and Claremont McKenna colleges, among others, a Washington Post analysis found.The Post found 37 schools where the early-decision share of enrolled freshmen in 2015 was at least 40 percent. At Duke University, the share was 47 percent, and at the University of Pennsylvania, it was 54 percent.[The rising influence of early-decision enrollment underscores a stark and growing divide in college admissions between the masses of students who apply to multiple schools through the “regular” process in quest of the best fit and deal and a privileged subset who apply early and simultaneously pledge to attend just one, without fear of cost, at a time when the sticker price for private schools often tops $60,000 a year. Call them the Shoppers and the Pledgers.College admissions: The Early Decision advantageNathan Hanshew, 17, a senior at Washington Latin Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., said he applied to a dozen schools but did not opt for early decision anywhere.“That was too risky,” he said. “You’re stuck in a bond, like a marital bond.”Shopping around paid off hugely for Hanshew, a Polish immigrant, who learned March 17 in a surprise announcement in front of cheering classmates that he won a full-ride scholarship from George Washington University.Kate Morrison (Family photo)Kate Morrison, 17, a senior at Walt Whitman High School in Montgomery County, Md., said she was drawn to Bowdoin after a soccer coach there encouraged her to apply early. She visited the Maine college last spring. “I just loved it so much,” she said. “I was really, really content.” No athletic scholarship, no financial aid. But she applied early decision in the fall and was admitted Dec. 11. Her search was done.This week, angst is cresting for traditional applicants as prestigious colleges finalize who’s in and who’s out. Ivy League decisions are scheduled to be released Thursday evening. But admitted early-decision students are tranquil; they’ve known for months where they’re going to college. Early-decision applicants also enjoy a crucial edge over the regulars: Their admission rates tend to be much higher. That’s because schools want good students who really want them, and they want to lock them down.At Penn, the admission rate for early applicants was 24 percent for the class that entered in 2015. The total admission rate, early and regular, was 10 percent. Eric Furda, Penn’s dean of admissions, said the academic credentials of students who win early admission tend to be stronger than those admitted later in the cycle. Furda also said more early-decision students than ever are qualifying for need-based financial aid.“This pool is becoming broader and deeper and more diverse than it’s ever been. It’s time to start telling that story,” Furda said. “I don’t want lower-income families to be told, ‘Don’t apply early decision because you’re going to need to compare financial-aid packages.'” These days, nearly as many early-decision freshmen receive need-based grants from Penn as their peers admitted in the regular cycle, he said.The Post reviewed 2015 admissions data for 64 schools as reported through a questionnaire called the Common Data Set. The analysis covered top-60 schools on U.S. News and World Report lists of liberal arts colleges and national universities, and it found 48 schools in which early-decision admits comprised at least a third of the total enrolled class and 16 in which they comprised at least half.[While most early-decision admits enroll, a few do not. The most common reason: If a financial aid offer is deemed insufficient, an admitted student may be released from their pledge.Within the Ivy League, Penn appears to be the most aggressive user of the early process. The early-decision share of freshmen at Dartmouth College was about 43 percent. At Brown and Cornell universities, it was about 38 percent. Columbia University, which also uses early decision, is the only Ivy League school that refuses to make public its Common Data Set reports.Harvard, Yale and Princeton universities also allow students to apply early, but they do not require admitted students to decide on enrollment until May 1. That technique, which enables comparison shopping, is known as “early action.” Stanford, the University of Chicago, MIT and hundreds of other schools use early action.Georgetown University’s longtime dean of admissions, Charles Deacon, said he favors early action because students should be as sure in May of where they want to attend as they were in November. He calls it a “student-centered” approach to admissions, in contrast to “enrollment management” techniques in vogue at many schools.“No matter what anybody tells you, the early pool favors those who are more advantaged,” Deacon said. “They’re the ones who have been better advised. They know more from their families. There’s an advantage, for sure, and that plays itself out particularly at the early level.”Early decision, which developed gradually among elite schools from the late 1950s through the 1970s, has drawn criticism in recent years, earning a critique in a 2001 Atlantic“For us, the early-action plan makes the most sense,” U-Va. dean of admission Greg Roberts said. “And it’s more in line with our values and enrollment goals.” Most top-tier schools with early decision are private. An exception is the public College of William and Mary, in Virginia.[Though some schools have spurned the practice, the volume of early-decision applications to elite schools is growing, and some of them are filling a larger share of their seats with those applicants, making it far more difficult to get in during the normal cycle.At Williams College, a premier liberal arts school in Massachusetts, a little more than 40 percent of freshmen come through early decision. Williams President Adam Falk said early decision provides stability for the college in what can be a volatile market, and it provides peace of mind for successful applicants who can then leave “an insane-feeling rat race” during their senior year of high school.Jon Reider, a former Stanford admissions officer who counsels students at San Francisco University High School, said that 15 years ago, early decision was not a central part of most of his advising conversations. Now it is. Another important variable is that ultra-selective Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and Yale are “single-choice” early-action schools, meaning that students may not apply early to any other private school, with few exceptions. So students must weigh their top choice carefully, and it can feel like making a life-altering gamble.But the calculations are much more complex than a simple ranking of choice, Reider said. Sometimes admission to that first-choice school is so tough to obtain, even in an early application, that it makes more sense to apply early decision to a second choice, or even a third choice. “You’ve got one chip,” Reider said. “One card to play. It’s an absolutely crazy system.”Even more bewildering: Some schools offer two rounds of early decision. Some — the University of Miami, for example — offer two rounds of early decisionCharlotte Smith (Family photo)Charlotte Smith, 17, a senior at Walt Whitman High, put her early-decision chip on Wake Forest University, in North Carolina. Her application was deferred into the regular pool. For many applicants, that is demoralizing. For Smith, it was a relief.“I’m actually glad,” Smith said last week as she had several applications pending and some offers in hand, including some with scholarships. It’s hard in November, she said, “to pick one school and say this has everything I want.” As students, she said, “we’re still trying on different versions of ourselves.”Micah Guthrie, 17, a senior at Washington Latin, is shooting for liberal arts colleges but not through early decision. “I make a lot of my decisions last minute,” he said. In the fall, he said, “I really didn’t know a lot about a lot of colleges.”Grade Point newsletterNews and issues affecting higher education.Sign upMicah Guthrie (Nick Anderson/The Washington Post)Among his targets is Davidson, advertised on a sweatshirt he wore to school the other day. His mother, Michelle Guthrie, a registrar at Washington Latin, said money is a factor wherever he gets accepted. “We’ll make it happen,” she said. “But I’m hoping some scholarships come with those choices, too.”Davidson had the highest share of early-decision admits in its entering class among colleges The Post analyzed: about 60 percent. Davidson said it is firmly committed to access, with half of the early-decision students who were admitted qualifying for need-based financial aid. That is nearly the same as the share in regular admissions who receive need-based aid. The small college, which has a robust NCAA Division I sports program, said it also relies heavily on early decision for athletic recruiting.A few years ago, the share of early-decision students entering Emory was less than 40 percent, said John Latting, the university’s dean of admission. Now two rounds of early decision fill about half of Emory’s class. Latting said the volume of early-decision applications has doubled in the past four or five years.“Mostly what’s going on is an unbelievably competitive marketplace” for top students, he said. “Early programs bring some calm to what is otherwise a frenzy.”Latting said Emory uses financial aid aggressively to ensure it enrolls a diverse class. About 20 percent of freshmen have enough financial need to qualify for federal Pell grants, a sizeable share for a private university. But Latting acknowledged that early-decision applicants, the Pledgers, tend to be more affluent than the regulars, the Shoppers. That creates added pressure on schools hunting for more students from low-income families.“I wouldn’t for a minute say this is the right system for the nation,” Latting said.Read more:At some colleges, your gender might give you an admissions edgeInside the admissions process at George Washington UniversityColleges often give discounts to the rich.

Cornell University — 13.96%7. Dartmouth College — 10.52%6. University of Pennsylvania — 9.41%5. Brown University — 9.01%4. Princeton University — 6.46%3. Yale University — 6.27%2. Columbia University — 6.04%1. Harvard University — 5.2%Every single Ivy League school, by a factor of two or three, appears easier to access when applying early. The contrast appears even starker if you were to isolate just the regular decision rate from the early decision rate, though all of the Ivies announce their spring numbers as a combination of the two.So what gives?Harvard UniversityIvy admissions offices emphasize that the reason it appears easier to get into schools during early admissions is more a factor of the strength of the applicant pool rather than an ease of acceptance.In other words, students who apply early to Harvard are probably better qualified compared the larger applicant pool, and more confident in their chances of being admitted.""We have continued to stress to applicants, their families, and their guidance counselors that there is no advantage in applying early to Harvard,"" William R. Fitzsimmons, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, said, in a release from Harvard. ""The reason students are admitted – early or during the Regular Action process – is that their academic, extracurricular, and personal strengths are extraordinary.""Harvard releases a survey on incoming freshman every year that provides details on the makeup of the class.Still, schools certainly find early applicants attractive as they can lock in a higher ""yield"" — the number of admitted students who decide to go to the college. Early decision is binding, and early action means that students are only allowed to apply to one school early (though they can apply regular decision to other schools) and then make their final choice in the spring.Some higher education experts feel that there is certainly an advantage to applying early, and that its practice is troubling, as it disproportionately helps wealthier students. The early admissions process is not possible for students who need to weigh the different financial aid packages they are offered before making a decision.Early admissions ""significantly disadvantages students from low-income and middle-income families, who are already underrepresented at such schools,""Still, it doesn't seem that the early admissions process is going anywhere soon. The Ivy League had a record number of early applications this year, and, more broadly, about 450 American colleges accept early applicants.The Ivy League has released early-application acceptance rates — here's where they all standThe Ivy League classes of 2021 are one step closer to attending the school of their dreams.Almost every Ivy League school reported the number of students who had applied and were accepted early this year, giving a glimpse into the college choices of tens of thousands of students.Business InsiderHarvard reported the lowest acceptance rate of the bunchApplications were up across the board. The biggest jump in application numbers came from Princeton University, which reported 4,229 early applications last year and 5,003 this year, an 18% increase year-over-year.Early applications come with some stipulations. Harvard, Princeton, and Yale are restrictive early-action schools, meaning applicants can apply to only one school early but have until May to accept.Brown University, Columbia University (which does not release acceptance figures),Check out the number of early applications to each Ivy League school this year below:Harvard just released its early admissions decisions — here's how many students got inHarvard University released the early action decisions for the class of 2021 on Tuesday.Harvard University released the early action decisions for the class of 2021 on Tuesday.Applications at the school were up 5% from the previous year, with 6,473, compared to 6,167, a spokesperson for the school confirmed.Of those applicants, 14.5% gained acceptances, versus 14.8% last year.""Early admission appears to be the 'new normal' now – as more students are applying early to Harvard and peer institutions than ever before,"" William R. Fitzsimmons, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, said, in a release from Harvard.""At the same time, we have continued to stress to applicants, their families, and their guidance counselors that there is no advantage in applying early to Harvard,"" he continued.

Due to the pandemic, there has been a significant increase in online degrees over the past year e.g. Derby, London, Essex, Birbeck.I would also recommend looking for internships and opportunities for work experience before you complete your first year at OU, or within the first semester of your university.If you're looking at the prospective returns on the financial investment of your degree, you would ideally use conservative estimates of your future average annual income (not looking at promotional prospects but include inflation adjusted income) net of taxes and student loan payments (if applicable) (and other costs) over your remaining work life, then divide that my the total amount of student loans and other costs of the degree. This is the ARR (look up the formula for it if you need to). If you want to be even more conservative, deduct your otherwise current average annual income over your remaining working life from the net income figure as well (this is to account for opportunity costs).If the ARR is not abysmally small, then it's worth looking into the degree.

It is to make some doe for the treasury. He can’t afford to have a government shutdown and is asking for money from everybody. Tariffs are in the end taxes that will be pocketed by the government. Along the way, he also asked NATO, Korea and Japan to increase their share in the military expense. It is also obviously just an attempt to ask for more money that his government can spend.Trillions of dollars wasted on wars have taken its toll and emptied US treasury. Trump is determined to have some back while he is at the office. Trump’s remarks and behavior may sometimes be inappropriate. But he is not an idiot.The real force behind anti-China rhetorics and war hawks in the think tank against China is deeply embedded in the establishment of the US government with a mindset that still lingers in Cold War eras. It has been going on for decades and has funded American journalism and media outlets to paint China as an evil communist country. This effort has been so persistent and pervasive that no matter who is elected to the office, during the campaign or during the reign in the office, he has to resort to sounding and acting tough against China to boost his polls.Anti China sentiments has taken hostage of the candidates’ politics. Bernie Sanders recently made some remarks about public health systems in Cuba and the fact that China has lifted the most people out of poverty in the world. But immediately afterwards, he has to make a statement that the US would protect Taiwan from the mainland, a statement no other political figures in the US have made before in terms of it’s clarity and forcefulness regarding the US stand on the Taiwan issue. Why? Because after he cited a fact about China that made China look good, he was accused of being a communist and anti America. Now he has to look tougher on China.That’s an example of how the incessant China bashing from the American media outlets for decades on end has done to the politics of the US. Politicians are taken hostage by populism and public opinions formed not from facts but pure propaganda.To reverse or mitigate that influence, regardless of democrats or republicans, the deep state has to revise its strategy and tone down its ambitions to topple China’s government. Reality has to set in and they should realize that China’s government can’t be overthrown by some tricks they used in Arab Spring or Ukraine. Color revolutions will not happen in China. It is in the American interest to not make China their enemy.Europe has already set an example. The theme of the Munich Security Conference this Feb. is ‘Westless’. European leaders have long meditated over the rise of China and what it means for the world. If the US wants to have a Cold War with China, Americans will be alone in this one. Europe will not take sides, as already reflected by their attitudes towards Huawei 5G.But as Churchill said, he will always trust Americans to make the right choices, until they have exhausted all possibilities. This anti China sentiment will not die down simply because of a change of office. It will take serious suffering and loss of US interests to initiate fundamental changes in the way US politicians think. When the market of anti China rhetoric for political opportunists start to die down, Sino-US relations can finally begin to heal.","1,129 followers",Choi Julian,629,230,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-can-I-do-with-an-MD-without-a-residency-I-want-to-take-a-year-off-before-residency

China did not agree to any rules the US has made about IP protection. I think there is an understanding in place now because China is producing more IP that needs protection than the US is, but it may still be at the negotiation stage.There was no forced technology transfer, if the company wanting to enter the dynamic Chinese market place did not want to abide by Chinese rules they did not have to enter China.There is a trade imbalance with almost every country the US deals with because the USD is the world’s most used reserve currency. The US buys goods and services from other countries to keep their USD in high circulation and allows the US consumer to enjoy lower prices of imported goods.The goods China sells to the US are sold mostly at wholesale. The goods China buys from the US are retail. China buys about 200 billion retail priced goods and materials and the US buys about 459 billion in wholesale priced goods.

22,"No, America will not win Trump’s ( or whoever’s ) trade war with China, both China and USA will be losers , just as a Chinese saying goes : Killing an enemy of one thousand at the cost of sacrificing your eight hundred soldiers .China will be heavily hit, millions of workers will lose jobs, many factories will be shut down, but China has the biggest single domestic market in the world and the highNo, America will not win Trump’s ( or whoever’s ) trade war with China, both China and USA will be losers , just as a Chinese saying goes : Killing an enemy of one thousand at the cost of sacrificing your eight hundred soldiers .China will be heavily hit, millions of workers will lose jobs, many factories will be shut down, but China has the biggest single domestic market in the world and the high tariffs by Trump can’t make significant impact on China’s GDP, many experts see only about 0.5 - 1.0 % hit on China’s GDP.When a lion and a tiger fight each other, both will be badly wounded . Now see what Trump will bring to America .The new 25% tariff, combined with earlier duties imposed on $50 billion in Chinese shipments and on steel and aluminum, would cut U.S. employment by 934,000 and cost the average family of four $767 a year, according to a some study. If Trump impose a 25% tariff on the remaining $325 billion in goods the U.S. imports from China, it would cost the U.S. 2.1 million jobs and the average family of four more than $2,000 a year .Many products no longer imported from China will likely be sourced from other countries, such as Vietnam, India , Mexico ,etc ., increasing the U.S. trade deficit with those nations. And higher retail prices and inflation will squeeze the wallets of American consumers, and they will shop less and that will be bad for economic growth.China also has imposed tariffs on U.S. exports to China and has threatened to expand them in response to Trump’s bullying , hurting U.S. farmers that produce soybeans, corn, beef, poultry, as well as makers of aircraft and boats, among other products. And the uncertainty caused by the trade war already has triggered a big selloff in U.S. stocks and crimped hiring and investment more broadly. China has another weapon , they can dump or reduce its holdings of more than $1.2 trillion worth of U.S. Treasuries in retaliation for the tariffs the Trump has imposed on Chinese imports. Large -scale selling of U.S. bonds will disrupt the financial markets, increase interests rate and borrowing costs and shake investors’ confidence in US dollars.Which American companies will suffer ...",9 followers,Amy King,3.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-for-me-to-back-to-education-and-study-an-OU-course-If-I-study-part-time-it-will-take-6-years-to-get-my-degree-and-there-is-no-guarantee-of-work-after-this-I-would-also-need-a-student-loan-to-cover

24,"Let’s be clear: “Trade War” is a political/news artifact, like “The War on Drugs” and all other political wars - the “War on Poverty” etc. Economically it is trivial.It is odd, because it is cried up by Trump’s opponents as much as anyone. 10% tariffs or even 25% make little difference and are easily evaded when necessary by ‘re-originating’ stuff via another country (largely Thailand and Indonesia when Obama put 25% tariffs on Chinese tyres 2009–2015).

They shout ‘disaster’ and ‘Smoot-Hawley’ and make it all look real and Trump big. Newscorps do the same, especially through low news periods like August.It also depends on vanity. The US takes for granted that it is a big dog and that its actions will have huge effects. Exports to the US account for 2.6% of the Chinese economy, which grew at 6.5% last year. Tariffs on half of this make no difference you can measure.They have had a bad effect, tho’, particularly the attack on Huawei (currently ‘suspended’) which has told Chinese corporations not to source from the US as one tweet can, apparently, cut off supply. Talk about cutting off your nose. It has also sabotaged the USDA’s - long planned and constructed - attempt to compete with the Aussies for meat and fruit in the Chinese market. Trump must be the toast of Adelaide.But it keeps the news agenda where Trump wants it, as this question and answer show - away from Russia, away from profiteering from the Presidency, away from paying off tarts, away from the fact this his lawyer is serving three years for doing what Trump told him.AND will give him a massive win next year when he ‘sorts out’ the mess and ‘gets what he has fought for’, alongside the North Korea Agreement (tba) in the lead up to the election. (The reality is that the US will be granted the same terms of trade with China as the rest of the world got in 2018 but that is not how it will appear. The NK agreement has been in the bag for some time, delivered by China as it happens, but awaiting the right moment for release).The USA is supreme in many things, but, above all, in providing entertainment people love. Hollywood stands head-and-shoulders and waistband above others, alongside HBO, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto, the Kardashians, etc. Trump has this nailed. The circus rolls on, filling the news channels and bar conversations.And US citizens pay 6 times as much for medicines, imprison more citizens at vast expense than any other country has ever done, cannot sort out it shooter or Opioid problem and pours money into the largest Armed force ever conceived for no clear reason.",UNKNOWN,Chris O'Leary,8K,4K,89.1M,https://www.quora.com/If-Donald-Trump-is-not-reelected-how-can-the-United-States-begin-to-repair-their-relationship-with-China-and-deescalate-the-trade-war-Is-this-even-possible

26,"Yes, Trump is to be blamed.All the excuses about China taking away jobs from the US is rubbish. China did not force the US companies to open factories in China or to use Chinese factories to make their products on a contract basis.

A significant portion of China’s exports to the US are the finished goods that US companies make in China.Besides, whatever the US pays to China is for goods of equal value received. To expect China or any country to import as much as they export to the US is like asking your barber to buy something from you so that you receive as much money from him, as he receives from you for your haircut.Trump has started this trade war through no fault of China. If he wants the US companies to start producing in the US, he should create an environment that will bring back production to the US.

China makes a lot of stuff we want to buy, at prices we want to pay. This is not necessarily a bad thing. About 80% of the products on Walmart’s shelves come from China, and Walmart makes it possible for people with limited resources to get what they need at very low prices.It would be easy to shrink the deficit by blocking or raising — through tariffs — the prices of Chinese goods. But American consumers would suffer as a result. They would end up with fewer items in their grocery cart, for the same money, just to shrink a number that ultimately isn’t that meaningful.A smart president would have focused on increasing our sales of higher margin services to China. That requires understanding more complicated issues like market access, theft of intellectual property, etc. trump can’t be bothered with that much detail.Moreover, his business career is based on a series of transactional relationships that usually end up in court. It’s why no US bank will lend him money, and how he ended up in a still mysterious relationship with Deutsche Bank.Most businesses don’t work that way. Agribusiness certainly doesn’t.
