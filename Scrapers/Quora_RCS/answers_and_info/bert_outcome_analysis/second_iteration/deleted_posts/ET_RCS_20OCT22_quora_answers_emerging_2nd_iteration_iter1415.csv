[ http://qr.ae/TUNFFi ] Based on my familiarity with Dr. Peterson’s academic work, I hope to contribute something meaningful as well.I went to work after high school in 1967, not an unusual choice then. However, Bob Dylan’s somewhat earlier prophecy that “The Times They Are a-Changing” was accurate. It was a turbulent time of change.Men my age could avoid military conscription and war by going to college. My peers signed up for higher education in numbers never seen before. While surely there were some serious students involved, a large proportion of young men going to college were simply looking for a party to go to while not going to Vietnam. Colleges and universities became more influential than ever before. Tens of thousands of not-so-serious students, wanting to avoid difficult science classes, gravitated toward liberal arts, increasing the influence of social science departments.Our parent’s and grand parent’s legacy of sacrifice and hardship during depression and world wars was now a vestige of history. Dissatisfied with a dubious war in a far away place killing our peers, my generation began to question and confront previously accepted values. Racial injustice, real gender discrimination and unfair advantages enjoyed by the wealthy — the rich kids somehow easily found ways around the draft — motivated us. And left leaning, socialist academics educated us.Howard Zinn re-wrote history in “The People’s History of the United States” convincing us our American forebears were nasty oppressors. Arguing for the political value of vulgarity, beat poet and professor Allan Ginsberg helped to dismantle previously accepted polite public discourse and manners. Nihilist stoner Jack Kerouac extolled the joys of irresponsibility in “On The Road”. Sociologists at Harvard sent their students to hit biologist E.O. Wilson in the face with a pie during a lecture. Wilson had the temerity to talk about scientific evidence supporting the notion that behavior was biologically influenced. Academic social dogma coming from the social sciences demanded that all behavior was learned. And Wilson was talking mostly about ants. Damn! Better not disagree with the liberal art’s world view, even a little.In a recent video Dr. Jordan Peterson talked about the value of dialectic discourse. Using his arm to mimic a snake’s movement, Dr. Peterson was attempting to explain how competing trends and ideas in politics and culture were a good thing. In the same way a snake moves side to side, the left to right movements of the snake propel it forward with an aggregation of lateral movement in the center. Politics, economies and culture are complex emergent systems. Binary explanations are inadequate. However, the simplified categories of popular arguments are generally represented in a binary fashion such as liberal or conservative. Each of those binary arguments pull the snake one way or the other. The snake keeps moving forward. But anybody who categorizes Dr. Jordan Peterson as conservative has not done their homework.In the nineties, I had achieved a fair degree of success in my orbit as a working class American. The majority of my peers, the Woodstock generation, moved on from sex, drugs and rock and roll, cut their hair and became mainstream. Educated as artists and thinkers, old hippies went to work as journalists, media people, business leaders and entertainers. They sent their kids back to the liberal institutions where they came of age. An amalgamation of academic philosophy, media, politics and entertainment was moving the cultural snake to the left. Feeling left out, uninformed, I enrolled in Brooklyn College and earned a BS in Psychology. I was forty-six.The work of a famous German Psychiatrist, Dr. Carl Jung, fascinated me. Dr. Jung postulated there exists a collective unconscious. Based on similarities amongst the myths, legends, religions and artistic expression throughout history and across cultures, Jung claims we all are somehow imbued with similar fundamental notions called archetypes.When I was studying psychology, Jung was presented as an interesting thinker but more of a intellectual artifact of a less informed time. Post modernist influences in the academic world eschewed the notion of anything having meaning. In kind of a re-booted version of existentialism, post modernists believe that meaning itself is but a human construct. Life is indeed so complex that two people arguing opposite sides of a philosophical argument can both be right. There is no universal correlative to the notion of meaning. We are making it all up.While Dr. Peterson agrees the post modernist have a point, Jordan directs his most passionate arguments against them. What befuddles him, and me, is where post modernism creates a philosophical void, academic adherents insert socialism.Shortly before Dr. Peterson’s rise to internet prominence, I discovered him on http://Quora.com. I became interested in Jordan’s incredibly insightful presentation of Dr. Carl Jung’s theories of archetypes. I read Peterson’s “Maps of Meaning” his life’s work. And I listened to — took the course in actuality — all twelve of Peterson’s two hour lectures on YouTube. Jordan had generously posted videos of his psychology course “Maps of Meaning”. The man is an amazing intellect and fascinating to watch. I had difficulty understanding Carl Jung. Peterson made Jung’s ideas about archetypical theories more accessible, explaining how humans have a propensity, an innate disposition, to abstract our physical experience into human constructs that emerge as stories, myths, legends and artistic expression. These constructs inform our culture, our politics and institutions. Humans worldwide share a common trait. We are all physical beings. From within our physical experience emerges all manner of human interaction, communication and expressiveness. The more clearly our abstractions convey meaning — meaningfulness itself a uniquely human abstraction — the more powerfully we are drawn.Peterson’s meteoric rise to internet stardom was catalyzed by a political stance. Jordan objected to Canadian provincial legislation requiring college professors to address trans-sexuals by their chosen pronoun. There exists a list of such pronouns one can Google if you so desire. Jordan objected to a government speech mandate where he, or anyone, would be required to use specific language of any kind.Academic post modernist socialists are at a crossroad. Marxian socialism was founded on the notion of oppression of the working class. Today in developed countries during good economic times, working class folks can have two cars in the garage and a summer home.When I was growing up, nasty racial and gender discrimination existed. Working class young men were dying in an unnecessary war. Here...",140 followers,Jeffery LeMieux,1.3K,93,182.1K,https://www.quora.com/How-does-computer-science-contribute-to-society

I know some left-leaning folks who appreciate Dr. Peterson and others who don’t, so I don’t think that the term “left-leaning” is the best category to use here. I’d prefer to use the phrase, “those who accept and those who reject his views.” That would remove the vague and inflammatory political associations. I suspect Dr. Peterson would appreciate that because he tries to avoid political labels for that reason.I’ve listened to some of Dr. Peterson’s podcasts and youtube broadcasts, as well as recently read through his 12 rules. I like the podcasts and videos more than the book because he’s an animated and entertaining speaker and he gets his interesting points across with a visual punch when he talks. The book misses some of that.Dr. Peterson says his rules and insights aren’t necessarily original but that they bear re-stating. I agree with him, especially in the light of the crisis faced by contemporary young males in the west who are hungry for meaning and purpose. Left without direction they can often become victims of totalitarians. This effect has been amply demonstrated by the recent history of the 20th century.Western culture has tried to move away from dogmatism and purpose imposed by traditional social authority. This has left many young people without a moral or practical foundation, and as Dr.Peterson suggests, this condition can breed disaffection and worse. It’s a bad idea in need of a solution. Dr. Peterson at least is proposing something, and many people find it useful.In the west, those on the political left tend to abhor public standards and institutions as proxies for oppression and slavery, intellectual or otherwise. They fail to recognize the degree to which we all depend on the coherence that such standards and institutions provide. Worse, many reject him because they see any claim of meaning and purpose as a threat to freedom.A lot of criticism comes from a political left that views itself as inherently smarter than the man on the street; as intellectually superior to those more “deplorable” men and women who like what Dr. Peterson has to say. Thus, the “stupid man’s smart man.”So in my estimation, Dr. Peterson is not the “stupid man’s smart man.” Rather, I think he’s better described as an “honest man’s mirror.” He brings his solid insights gained through a career in psychology and grounds them in an every-man experience. Guessing from the response, this has been a pretty effective approach.Is it possible that those who reject him don’t like what they see when they look in that “honest man’s mirror”?",285 followers,BB Stayman,1.7K,75,321.2K,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-INFJ-business-analysts-out-here-Is-it-well-suited

Extremists of left and right resemble each other in their intolerance of heresy, and if there's no room for Jordan Peterson's contributions in their respective Utopias, will there ultimately be any room in them for your own?

And when JBP claims to speak for men, he does not speak for all men.Furthermore, as a non-religious paranormal investigator, I value empirical evidence over metaphysical junk. I’m also not a huge fan of religious apologists. I essentially see JBP as being a modified version of Doug Giles concerning gender issues, and a modified version of William Lane Craig when it comes to metaphysics, epistemology, ontology and theology. Nevertheless I do think that JBP is a gifted psychologist though.What really bothers me about JBP more than anything else is that it appears to me he has no interest in the various sciences for their intrinsic value in themselves. JBP only appears to be interested in various branches of science for the sake of cherry picking from them to push his agenda. For example, when I used to study about snakes I did so because I was fascinated about how they lived along with their body mechanics. For JBP though, he’d only be interested in snakes (or anything for that matter) if he could extrapolate some data from them that would support his model for how humans should behave according to his rigid cultural standards.

It will take a long time, yes, but if you’re ardently against Peterson, you may actually come to see that his views have been grossly misrepresented by the left-leaning contingents of the media”, one person said.“The question demonstrates a lack of understanding of Jordan Peterson and smacks of indulging possibly in radical feminist ideology”, said another.ii) Jordan Peterson thinks the Pill destroyed Western civilization.—-Obviously you should play the video. Primary sources are always better than someone else’s summary.However, I do think it’s worth breaking down the relevant things that Peterson said about the Pill.i) It made women less happy on average. He doesn’t spell out why, but in context he seems to think that women are biologically ‘wired’ to be mothers, and become unhappy if they don’t. He doesn’t seem to think that there’s a corresponding biological drive in men to become fathers. Initially I didn’t understand his argument, because contraception allows women to delay childbirth, rather than forcing women not to have children at all. So I thought he must mean that women have an innate drive to become mothersii) It undermines “pair-bonding” and “matrimony”. He doesn’t spell out why, but he seems to mean that delaying or avoiding having children makes couples less likely to form and stay together. This means that “sexual access for makes is a Pareto-distributed phenomena”, that is that a small number of “alpha males” have sex with lots of women and a large number of males can’t find anyone (this is the basic complaint of the ‘incel’ subculture, and the question that Peterson was answering). He seems to think that it doesn’t work the other way round—there aren’t a small number of attractive women monopolizing the men—but doesn’t explain why not. Peterson’s solution to this situation is monogamy.iii) It has led to the birth-rate in “the West” being below replacement levels, which might “do us in” and is at least “a catastrophe”. He adds that “no one can talk about that” because of “egalitarianism and diversity and all of that”. He seems to mean that other races are growing in population while “the West” is shrinking, which will lead to those other races replacing us, which is catastrophic. He seems to believe, then, that members of other races who come to the West and adopt Western culture would not be “us”, but on the contrary would be replacing “us”. That is, “us”, or “the West”, is defined biologically rather than culturally.So, at the very least, Peterson appears to believe thati) Women are biologically wired to become full-time mothers, to the extent that they become unhappy if they don’t. There is no equivalent drive in men.ii) The incel subculture’s complaint—that normal men are locked out of forming relationships because all women want to have sex with “alpha males”—is fundamentally accurate.iii) “The West” is a race, not a culture. The replacement of the white race by other races is a real possibility, and would be “catastrophic”.Peterson is known for seldom spelling out solutions. However, it’s difficult to escape the conclusion that he wants to get rid of “the Pill”—that is, more generally, get rid of people’s ability to have sex without having children—and return to a world in which women are expected/forced to be full-time mothers, and sex is expected/forced to be part of getting married and having children. This will, he seems to think, allow women to be happy by fulfilling their innate biological drive, and the increased birth-rate will save “the West” from being out-bred by other races.I assume that the other people who answered the question have seen the same video—or, at least, have seen or read other material in which Peterson expresses his opinions on contraception and related issues.And yet they appear to be certain that he never said any of the things that he did, in fact, say.

17,"He's a culture warrior for conservative values who speaks well, but doesn't really say much.He has some good ideas, but these aren't new ideas and they are mostly obvious.He seems to be a “classical liberal” who believes that government should treat everyone equally and stay out of moral and cultural issues. I basically agree with him here.He defends traditional gender roles, morality and social hierarchies. I disagree with him strongly here. His arguments in favor of these things all seem to be variants of “it got us to where we are now, so it must be good” or “it's just the natural order”.

I don't find these arguments very convincing and I get mildly annoyed when people take them seriously.I find his speaking style off-putting; it feels like he takes himself too seriously.He seems to either have an irrational hatred of the SJW crowd, or just enjoy provoking them to get attention.I don't see why so many people take Jordan Peterson so seriously.",0 followers,Ash Wilson-Smith,1.4K,287,2.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-left-leaning-Quorans-think-about-Jordan-Peterson
18,"I don’t know what all the fuss is about.First of all, I can not see that he is a right wing conservative spouting hate speech, despite many people wishing desperately to pin that on him. Nor is he a crazed leftie either.He’s a guy who objects vehemently to an Ontario and Federal Canadian law which imposes alien and artificial forms of language which they demand and exposes him to serious penalties if he does not comply . To that end the senior management of the University have already sent him two written warnings.Sorry people, none of us would would agree to compulsion of that nature.","5,626 followers",Bruno Campello de Souza,788,1.3K,16.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-left-leaning-Quorans-think-about-Jordan-Peterson
