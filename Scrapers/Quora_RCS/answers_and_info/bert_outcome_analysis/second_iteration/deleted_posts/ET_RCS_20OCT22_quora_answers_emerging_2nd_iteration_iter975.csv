Look.Government of Canada exploring the potential of Ethereum BlockchainI’m really in love with Ethereum, not only using it for capital gains but for also building awesome projects on top of its smart contract protocol. We will introduce a lot of initiative in our crypto project,If you’re still not convinced.Lets deploy a smart contract on ethereum blockchain where you & me will transfer 10 ETH each. Funds will be locked up for whole 2018. The bet is, ETH will cross $2000 by year end (it’s trailing around $800 now). The smart contract will check the price on 31st December 2018 and transfer all of the 20 ETH to my address if the price is above $2000 and if not, your address will receive all of them. What’s your take?You see, there’s no middlemen between us and yet the safety of funds are ensured by codes running on ethereum blockchain. No one can change it. It’s immutable. Isn’t it cool?Governments struggle to ban technologies like Tor, encryption and dark web, it seems impossible to imagine them gaining the ability to truly impact cyrpto currencies in a way that could impede its progress.If governments could effectively stop a peer to peer network, they would’ve shut down the illegal practices of torrent websites over a decade ago. But they can’t. The files are shared in a decentralised manner.There’s no central server like Netflix or Amazon Prime Videos. Torrent network is peer to peer network so if you’re downloading Movie Dunkirk via a torrent network, you’re not downloading it from any central server instead from the network of devices (laptops, mobiles etc) where the Dunkirk is stored (that’s called seeding).And I’m pretty much sure, government can’t track and take down all the devices globally.Similarly, it’s impossible to take down crypto currencies.However I’m sure,Keep crypto-investing.",166 followers,Sumit Gupta,4.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-Narendra-Modis-biggest-lies-false-claims
15,"What you see below the screen is the RSI indicator. It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI asWhat you see below the screen is the RSI indicator. It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI as it’s falling from point 1 to point 2. Now the question is “Why the heck it the price going up but the RSI falling down?”.Well this is called Divergence. The real reason that this divergence showed up here is that the big (smart) money pulled out of the market at point 1 (Either all of the big smart money or a big chunk of it). Then after point 1 the price decreased for two weeks as you can see on the chart. Now that the big whales are out, the small fish came swimming and put their money in so the price goes up to point 2 but there’s a difference between price reaching point 1 and price reaching point 2. The difference is that for example 10 rich whales invested 10 billion dollars in bitcoin so it reached point 1, then they pulled out their money and the small fish came to play so 100,000 normal people invested 10 billion in bitcoin and it rose again to point 2. Do you see the difference? 10 rich smart whales don’t panic, they know what they’re doing, but 100,000 average traders who are looking to make a quick buck will panic with the first sign of danger. so from point 1 to point 2 those big whales pulled out of the market so slow and subtle that those fish didn’t suspect a thing. They kept buying the overpriced bitcoin and the whales were happy to sell at the top. One red candle shows up, the fish panic and sell like crazy and the rest is history.That divergence is the real reason why the prices dropped but there’s no reason to panic. Heavy drops are good for the market. The funny part is that now while the fish are panicking and selling their valuable assets those whales would enter again and buy the cheap coins to get ready for the $100k bitcoin (remember bitcoin dropped from $20k to $3200 to get ready for the $40k, $50k and $60k.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,639,55,4.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-Narendra-Modis-biggest-lies-false-claims
16,"Definitely. In the future we won’t be using paper or plastic money, everything will be done online. Now is the time to prepare, and there are many good currencies that one can take a look at today.Cryptocurrency is better than FIAT in several ways:-Speed: Cryptocurrencies offer much faster speeds than, say, a wire transfer. These days, many cryptocurrencies offer instant or near instant transactions, which are far superior to 24–48 hours it can usually take with fiat. I have seen other posters mention that faster isn’t necessarily better, if you sent to the wrong address. New cryptocurrencies,Definitely. In the future we won’t be using paper or plastic money, everything will be done online. Now is the time to prepare, and there are many good currencies that one can take a look at today.Cryptocurrency is better than FIAT in several ways:-Speed: Cryptocurrencies offer much faster speeds than, say, a wire transfer. These days, many cryptocurrencies offer instant or near instant transactions, which are far superior to 24–48 hours it can usually take with fiat. I have seen other posters mention that faster isn’t necessarily better, if you sent to the wrong address. New cryptocurrencies, such as Divi, allow users to associate each wallet’s public key with a unique name of their choice, which can be used by others to send funds or connect with them, instead of the long strings of random characters that are a wallet’s “public key” and are considered a big barrier of entry to the world of cryptocurrencies today. There will also be pin-code confirmation features, and other features to make it more secure and friendly.-No middleman and completely trustless and decentralized. You don’t need to trust the bank to execute it correctly or at all(many errors do happen), it is entirely peer to peer.-Can be used everywhere, by anyone, anytime…even if you don’t have a bank account or are sending to someone who doesn’t have a bank account.-More secure, especially due to the decentralized/trustless factor. Digital ledger technology is virtually impregnable by attackers. The system is so complex that the attacker has to perform multiple attacks on multiple devices at once.-Much lower fees than fiat. Nearly free, basically.Really those are just a few of the main reasons, but overall cryptocurrencies are far superior in speed, cost and security than any fiat currency.What else sets DIVI apart? Divi has a stated goal of mass adoption and the founders claim they want to make cryptocurrency as easy to use as paypal. Divi was created in order to address a number of the perceived barriers to mass adoption by the general public; Among those are speed, scalability and ease of use. Among the advisors of the team are Former CSO of Yahoo! Tim Sanders, and technologist Ramez Naam.Divi utilizes a proof of stake protocol. The proof-of-stake system was designed to address vulnerabilities that could occur in a pure proof-of-work system. It was also developed to address the high energy consumption of bitcoin. The network is maintained and secured by masternodes. The masternode software is really just a different version of mining, with far less power consumption. it only requires the energy to run the client software on a computer, as opposed to running resource-intensive cryptographic hashing functions. The masternode communicates with other nodes in the network and keeps a copy of the blockchain, constantly checking and updating it. In return, masternode owners get rewarded with newly minted coins.DIVI has many innovations, among them:The first cryptocurrency using a 5 tiered masternode system. By doing so it claims to create a more decentralized system, since the entry cost is lowered and the lower tier masternodes are more affordable.Divi advertises itself as the first cryptocurrency to implement the lottery blocks reward system. With this system, every week 11 winners will be randomly selected to be rewarded with extra coins.-Each wallet can have various “Pockets”. For example, a user may have a public wallet that shows very little, or no cash inside, and then “dark send” it to an anonymous pocket. DIVI will also have an Oraclet feature.-Scheduled payments - send money later, or on a specific date-“One Click” Masternode Setup: Divi developed easier to use masternodes that don't require experts to install-Divi claims to be the world’s first democratic blockchain. Because of the easy one-click masternode install, anyone can participate.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-Narendra-Modis-biggest-lies-false-claims

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it?

Reporting that the human race had now progressed into a space born civilisation. The signal was pointed to another monolith, in an orbit around Jupiter.A manned mission was sent to investigate why the signal was pointed towards Jupiter. The mission failed, but one of the crew, David Bowman, abandoned the space vessel in a pod to investigate the monolith up close.When Bowman touches the monolith (like the human ancestors all those thousands of years before) he too is transformed, but in a much more fundamental way. He arrives in a place where time and space have a different meaning. He is kept there to live out his life, or so it seems. At the end of his life, the monolith appears to him once more and Bowman is transformed into something that isn't strictly human any more, but maybe something alike the intelligence that created the monoliths.The film keeps these things a bit more open for interpretation, the book that was written in tandem with the film's development explains these affairs in more detail. You can however see that the film does depict these events.Kubrick just chose to leave more unsaid so the audience can give meaning to the ending themselves.",622 followers,Eddie Firmani,844,7.8K,2.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-Narendra-Modis-biggest-lies-false-claims
