3,"A lot of people have taken this platform to brand you as the quintessential Indian hater, but the fact remains, your concerns are incredibly valid in today's world.Let's first understand the third, and I will divide it further into 2 parts:-A lot of people have taken this platform to brand you as the quintessential Indian hater, but the fact remains, your concerns are incredibly valid in today's world.Let's first understand the third, and I will divide it further into 2 parts:-2. As you said, misrepresented facts. So what if India has the second largest labour force, I could also say, it is the second largest producer of human excreta. Excuse my language, but it is a meaningless fact. Most of these fact, largest consumers, largest workforce, etc. can be explained by our flooding population. Nothing to be proud of.Others are simply false or embellished. For example, in a country where more than 50 percent people don't know about climate change, I can't believe that 60 percent Indian waste is recycled.There are others not mentioned in this video, namely:-So, yeah, often, we happiness loving people extract out useless reasons to be proud of ourselves/our country. Plus,  I mean, come one, it looks way cooler to say that an Indian invented hotmail than to say that Indian's are extensive users of Gobar Gas.There are idiots in every country's population, some more loud-mouthed than others, and hence the video. But if you are looking, India still has some pretty impressive achievements, even today to be proud of.1. India is in the league of 10 countries of the World to have a launch system for satellites. 10, that's saying something. Even developed countries don't have this technology., and yet we do. India has a satellite presence, It sent missions to moon and Mars. That's pretty cool, and I am proud, if not for the country, then at least for those amazing and able-minded scientist who performed this feat.2. India virtually established a market of IT sector outsourcing from scratch and till today, remains it's biggest providers. This is how outsourcing looks, those tiny little problems, that you don't have skills to solve, send them here. We, sitting in our homes will solve them with ease and then demand huge payments, which you will gladly provide, and India as well as it's Government have handled this trade pretty well. Actually, this is one field where the real credit goes to the Indian Government for the providing backbone of this system. - education, infrastructure, custom rates, satellite communication, blah, blah, blah. Again, something to be proud of.3. Since it's formation, India has not attacked any country, for any reason whatsoever. During Cold War, India pioneered the the Non-Alignment and stood by it. Indian military tactics are one of the most ethical in the world. Here is an example, during Kargil War, India could infiltrate LOC and block enemy supply lines, but they did not do so, as that would be considered attacking another country. Speaking of military, India has the record of the shortest time to liberate a country. 11 days for the Bangladesh War.4. Nuclear Power5.

The pilot was relieved that he was able to give the Indian authorities a narrow window to launch rescue operations.Now comes the sad part, the plane remained parked on the tarmac for 45 mins.What did India do?Nothing.The NSG couldn’t reach the site as apparently they didn’t have a plane to ferry them from Delhi to Amritsar.The Punjab Police Chief had his commandos trained in Anti-Terrorism operations on Stand By, awaiting orders from Delhi. Delhi’s response was a negative as they didn’t want any casualties.India couldn’t even block the plane from taking off. The terrorists became suspicious and directed the pilot to take off.As the plane neared Lahore, Pakistan switched off the lights of its runway and airport. Desperately the pilot tried to land the plane on what he believed to be the runway only to realize moments before landing, that it was a Highway. The pilot miraculously saved the plane from landing.India literally begged to Pakistan, to allow the plane to be refueled at Lahore.The plane then went on to land in Lahore, from there to Dubai and then finally to Kandahar. The armed militia of Taliban in Kandahar were able to surround the aircraft in record speed, unlike the Indian response in Amritsar.(The Taliban militants who surrounded the plane)The story ended with India accepting the demands of the Hijacker of releasing three dreaded terrorist: Maulana Masood Azhar, Ahmed Omar Saeed and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar and a huge lump of undisclosed money.How did the released terrorist return the favour?A terrorist attack on the Parliament and the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack !PS : Masood Azhar is the same guy, who is being protected by China, by blocking India’s bid to list him as a Global Terrorist in the UN.(I won’t put his picture, cause I think he deserves the noose more than he deserves fame)",UNKNOWN,Akshay,10.4K,2.3K,9.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Indians-so-proud-of-India-for-some-tiny-achievements

That’s more a question for a quantum physicist.But to me hard light is one of the most ridiculous concepts in SciFi. You see it in almost everything too, from Star Trek’s holodeckTo to X-Men’s Danger RoomAnd I really don’t see the realism in it. Light isn’t “hard”, it’s not even “soft”, it’s just light. It has no physicality to it because it’s not matter (yes sometimes it behaves like a particle, but ultimately it’s still classified as energy).Really the only version of this that made any dang sense is Black Panther’s vibranium sandit looked really cool, worked in the story, and given the make-believe properties of vibranium, makes a degree of sense.Minority Report’s classic interface was also pretty rad, simply because it had a glove that controlled it so it wasn’t trying to do some hard light BSAnd it just plain looked cool.Edit: Someone brought up force fields. OK, that’s also BS sci-fi magic though. What kind of energy field can hold back a physical object? Magnets? Ok you got me there. Of the hard light BS you see all the time in SciFi, force fields kind of walk the line between possible and complete fantasy. On the one hand, I could see using them the way they use them for the Brig in Star Trek: something that painfully rejects something trying to go through it.

14,"What science fiction technology makes no sense?Oh boy. There's enough nonsense in science fiction to drown the world.But let's address some cases…Okay. I perfectly understand how shields could be made to work in real life.But here's the real absurdity of Shield technology in Star Trek.— Shields can't be recharged.Yes. While fighting shields have only one setting… DOWN!You see the characters saying…But you never see them say even when they are redirecting power to the shields…Which obviously makes almost no sense at allWhat science fiction technology makes no sense?Oh boy. There's enough nonsense in science fiction to drown the world.But let's address some cases…Okay. I perfectly understand how shields could be made to work in real life.But here's the real absurdity of Shield technology in Star Trek.— Shields can't be recharged.Yes. While fighting shields have only one setting… DOWN!You see the characters saying…But you never see them say even when they are redirecting power to the shields…Which obviously makes almost no sense at all. More so when they say they can redirect power to the shields.But the thing that really tops it all in terms of nonsense, is that when the shields get hit you see people in the ship being thrown all over the place.And here's the problem with that…The shields as the image show, they are not touching the hull of the ship. They are more like a bubble surrounding the ship.So if they are not touching the ship then how in blazes do people get thrown around in the ship. More so when the ship has the so calledIn A New Hope and even Rogue One, we learn about something they call “Jump to lightspeed”.Which if we use today's understanding of Quantum Mechanics, then Hyperspace should work as a form of Quantum Tunneling.Where the ship would transverse Point A and Point B, by using a dimensional shortcut.But we are then told that in order to travel through Hyperspace one needs to follow routes.And here you can see said routes.Which obviously makes no sense whatsoever.If you are using a “jump to lightspeed” and you are obviously not traveling inside normal space then why the hell do you need routes!?This would only make sense in the case of Wormholes and Gravity Drives.Really because a Wormhole could be quantum linked to fixed point in space-time. Meaning that two Wormholes might only lead to those specific points in the galaxy.While a Gravity Drive might use gravity tunnels/pathways that have an already established form/shape, that need to be traveled through.Okay. This may come as a shock for some of you but what was said in Terminator 1 and 2, could've never happened in real life.More so Terminator 3 showed us why such a thing could never happen.We are told in the first two Terminator movies that Skynet, this AI, becomes self-aware and then it decides to eliminate the human race, because the human race is its biggest threat.THIS IS NONSENSE TO UNIMAGINABLE LEVELS!Follow logic and know why this is simply moronic:Hence from the get go the Skynet scenario is completely false. By destroying humanity it would only ensure its own destruction.And in case you need evidence of that then look no further than the Mars rovers.These machines although equipped with a computer processor and able to do things autonomously, they can't for example wipe the photovoltaic panels it has so it can keep on running until some crucial system broke down.Once the photovoltaic panels get too dirty with Marcian dust, the rover simply “dies” because it can't get the energy it needs to keep on working.Same goes for Skynet. Without humans it would eventually die as well.I could accept that an Artificial Intelligence that spread itself all over the internet, could for example want to guide humanity away from destructive behavior. And that it would impose its will upon humanity.Which could happen and we would have very little choices but to reach a consensus and then exist in a kind of symbiotic relationship.But an AI simply deciding to wipe out humanity. The very same thing it needs to survive, is science fiction fiction.We've seen them in the Matrix and other sci-fi works.Where you got these things connected to you spinal column that then allow your brain to enter cyberspace.This is almost always complete sci-fi BS.Unless that plug has neural links to all the parts of the brain, then connecting to one's spinal column wouldn't put anyone's mind inside anything.The most scientifically correct approach would be this one…Something that directly links to the brain.OR… Something that wirelessly links to the brain.And still in order to avoid major problems, we would need to develop an entirely new form of machine-biology interface. Something that used man made biological neural connectors.Unlike what some believe, placing wires (even if they are thiner than a hair) in the brain has its issues.Not to mention that no one knows exactly how the human brain would cope, with the human mind being inside an entire digital environment.Can the human brain even accept that the mind is being transmitted outside of it? We have seen cases of sleep disorders that may point to it actually being something that could kill the person.So in the Stargate tv show we had this element called Naquadah.Naquadah in its raw state looks like a rock.When refined it can be made into a solid material, that has room temperature superconductor properties.Not only that, Naquadah can also be made into a solid or liquid variation that has energy production properties.Just this small vial of Naquadah can power a Jaffa staff and Goa'uld technology for years, apparently.But wait! There's more.Naquadah can be made into a kind of blueish liquid, that can then be inserted into people's bloodstream. Allowing them to use the Naquadah in their blood to power Goa'uld technology for several years.And if this wasn't enough there's also another version of Naquadah known as Heavy Naquadah, where a small box size worth of it can power an entire mothership. Capable of FTL travel, shield technology, and energy weapons.So where's the nonsense in all of this?Naquadah can be turned into too many things.Stargates are made and powered by Naquadah. Which can create a kind of singularity that allows matter to travel between two gates.The absurdity reaches extreme levels when I said “singularity”.We're talking about an object capable of creating something that usually takes the core of a supermassive star to collapse in on itself.Where to begin…So let's look at the absurdity of what is a droid in Star Wars.Look at this piece of scientific nonsense!First and foremost the limbs and joints.Do you honestly think you could ever make a combat unit out of this lego pieced together scientific nonsense? Because if you do, then seek psychological help.The limbs and joints would never allow for complex movement.You might as well give a blaster to a chimpanzee.There's a reason why Skynet eventually came to the conclusion that creating these units would be the most combat efficient.Because at least in the Terminator movies the HK's (Hunter-Killers) were designed to serve specific functions.Infiltration units obviously need to look human so they can better blend in.While if you only wanted mayhem and murder, you could skip with elegant designs and go for maximum killing capacity and max shielding so it can also take a lot of punishment.Then we got information input!Why would you limit a battle unit that it can only see what is in front of it? Why not give it 360° vision? So it can't be caught off guard.Why not equip droids with the capacity to see in multiple ranges of the EM Spectrum? Like optical, infrared and ultraviolet.People at Star Wars were like…I can't even begin to explain the astronomical level of stupidity necessary to create such a thing and think…This is like you having two legs but only using one to drive. Perfectly normal? Nope! Never!Yep. Here's me looking at you Tony…Do you Quora fellow members know, which was the only suit that Tony created, that was minimally scientifically efficient to use?This one!All the other suits would've been the death of Tony Stark.Mainly because although the suits metal was resistant you can't forget that the inside of the suit (Tony body), was as vulnerable as any other human body.So Iron Man getting punched through walls, hitting or getting hit by steel metal pieces.Simply being thrown around like a ragdoll would've broken every one of Tony bones. Not to mention caused massive internal bleeding. And his brain with all that throwing around, he would be reduced to a vegetable state drooling all over himself.One thing is this suit…The Max Steel suit not only goes beyond nanotechnology and is more like Tesseract technology. But it also is constantly generating a field of energy that protects the user.And if that was not enough, suit and body are kinda blend in a biological-technological symbiotic link.Meaning that while wearing the suit, Max Steel human body is actually enhanced to superhuman levels.But none of Tony Stark suits, expect for that last one, comes close to that.The Mark 50 suit that Tony created, its nanotechnology, can be used to explain how Tony very human body can handle such punishment.Explaining that the suit also had personal energy shields would've helped a lot to sell it. Even the other suits would've been perhaps minimally credible.Yes. Left this one for last because nothing is more insane than this.This is the absolute antithesis of the wordSo how does this absurdity works? Here's a quote:“The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar distances in a few seconds; without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.As the Improbability Drive reaches infinite improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously.In other words, you're never sure where you'll end up or even what species you'll be when you get there. It's therefore important to dress accordingly.The Infinite Improbability Drive was invented following research into finite improbability which was often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess' undergarments leap one foot simultaneously to the left in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy.Many respectful physicists said they wouldn't go to stand for that sort of thing, partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.”So to make this simple to understand.The Infinite Improbability Drive places you in all possible realities in every possible dimensions, at the same time. You are essentially everywhere at the same time until you are somewhere.Although this was obviously created to be a joke, I do got to say that it trumphs everything else in fiction when it comes to absurdity and stupidity. More so because it is disguised as some form of technology when in fact this is merely a parody.Any drive that could place you everywhere at the same time, instead of all that monkey around, it should be able to take anyone anywhere in existence, instantly. No matter the destination..On a side note I'll also present the piece of technology most underused in all of fiction.That's right all Star Trek fans. This show has the most underused technology in all of fiction.How so? Well… How does Beaming works?Beaming technology converts Matter into Energy saving theSo a Transporter is a Matter-Energy converter.Meaning there's no reason why ships need fusion reactors at all.There's no reason why ships need to go to starbases and resupply.There's no reason why a ship can't stay in space indefinitely.There's no reason why a ship would ever need parts.There's no reason why people still needed to be operated on.With Beaming technology you could simply turn Matter into Energy. Meaning Antimatter wouldn't be needed at all to achieve the energy requirements of a Warp Drive.Conflicts because of planets rich in Dilithium crystals… What for? When you can simply beam a piece of Dilithium, record its pattern, and then apply it to more energy converted into Matter.Same would go for food or anything else.As for operating on people… Why do that? When one could simply beam the person, target what is wrong with the person, delete it or change it back to a healthy state, and then end the beaming.Thus people would never feel a thing. Every ailment could be cured or deleted. People could even live forever, seeing you could record the pattern of one's cells and then apply it again and again from time to time.People would be young, forever.Even those shipyards…Useless!More so when you could convert all the Matter needed to make a ship into energy, then one would apply a new pattern/blueprint for what we wanted to get. And the beaming would end with ships being made in minutes possibly seconds.And this concludes my answer.",264 followers,Michael Johnson,770,55,395K,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Indians-so-proud-of-India-for-some-tiny-achievements

We stopped using swords as weapons in wars for a reason, having the sword been made out of energy or plasma or something along that sort of things won’t change the range advantage given by ranged weapons. Also, light sabers should emit so much heat you shouldn’t be able to wield them, just been near to them might cause your burns, even if you are not touching them or grabbing it.Destroying planets:You can kill the inhabitants by life wipping the planet at a small fraction of the cost and resources.Battle space ship pilots.An advance civilization, if they have space wars, they will most likely have AI piloted ships, and will not need a person to pilot the ship. Furthermore, such advanced civilization should be able to produce far better combat AI than any human pilot, even better yet, not only they would have individual AI for individual combat ships, the AI should be able to perform better team tactics and swarm tactics for multiple units than human pilots could ever do, besides getting better tactical possitioning, as well as be more willing to sacrifice certain units if it increases the probabilities of winning the battle.Invisibility:If you are invisible to others, you can’t see anything as well, because in order to be invisible you would need light to bend around yourself or to trasspass yourself without interacting with you, as such, light wouldn’t be able to reach and interact with your eyes.My personal solution would be if you could see light in another frecuency outside of visible light spectrum. Of course a camera that can see light in that spectrum should be able to detect you.For instance the goggles might allow you to see infrared light which is not visible to humans, while you are invisible to visible light frecuency.Another possibility would be with ultrasonic sound waves above the limit of human audible sound waves.And use those waves in a similar way to bats to recreate a computer generated image of your surroundings based on data of ultrasonic reflected wave pattern data:An image based on the ultrasonic mapping of the surroundings or based on light of wavelenghts not visible to the human eyes can be made of visible light projected on a screen that is just in front of your eyes, tightly sealed to your face so that light can’t scape.Or it could perhaps be projected directly into the brain with cochlear implants connected to the visual cortex.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,759,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Indians-so-proud-of-India-for-some-tiny-achievements

Those windy ocean islands will dry a person out, especially with all the sweating he would do.Also, they made a big deal about him not being able get past the waves. That was the reason he was trapped for four years. Waves are rarely constant 24/7. Seems unlikely, he couldn't find a calm time to make his escape. Also, waves are mostly created by wind. There is a scene where he is on the hilltop and he scans the entire island, showing waves crashing from all 360 degrees. This is a very odd island. It appears to be a nexus where all wind gathers from all sides. I have spent much of my life traveling and sailing with my Dad; I have never seen a perfect 360 degree wind condition possibly ever, but especially on such a small island. Surely, that island could have provided a small windshield large enough for Tom to travel away?LoveTom has had an epic adventure and is back to civilization. He calls Helen Hunt and we see her home feeding a child and dropping the phone shocked, SHOCKED by the news Tom is alive. It is fast and the whole point of the scene is to show us what an impact the news has on her.Anyone notice the age of that kid? This really pulled me out of the movie. You might think, who cares? The story is about Tom and Helen and the love they had before it was stolen from them due to Tom's castaway years.Exactly!!Before Tom's fate, the movie shows how in love the two are with each other. There is talk of marriage. They share holidays with their families. They are an important part of each other's lives. After Tom returns, Helen gives Tom a speech about how in love she is with him even now, despite being married to a new man. She goes on to talk how he is “ the love of my life.” It all makes her marriage to the other guy seem so tragic knowing the man she should have married is still alive. So, let's get back to the kid.In the scene where Helen drops the phone, the kid is there and looks to be at least two years old. It didn't take more than a second for me to think, was Helen having an affair? Was that a plot twist? The kid is too young to be Tom's kid. Why is that kid so old? Nope, no plot twist.Tom was on the island for four years. That means two years and nine months earlier, Helen got pregnant and was presumably married. That gives Helen one year and three months to:All of these are possible in 15 months, if everything goes perfectly. However, if a movie wants me to think her love for Tom is as strong as they portrayed, mourning Tom's death alone is going to take her 15 months, if not longer. Even more time will be needed before she is interested in dating again.All of this could have been avoided by simply casting a new born baby and representing a larger island.",71 followers,Damon Troope,1.6K,100,622K,https://www.quora.com/What-major-movies-have-the-biggest-plot-holes
