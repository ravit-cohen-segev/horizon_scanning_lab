Individually or combined, they drive everything we think and do. They express themselves in infinite ways in a world that is less threatening to survival and reproduction, but more complex.Understanding and acting on those three needs, both in yourself and in others, is key to navigating today’s world, to communicating effectively (or influencing if you prefer) and achieving what you want. The three needs are:* Need to feel in CONTROL of one’s life. This is where our taste for knowledge, freedom, status, power, insurance, property, astrology and money comes from. Losing one’s control over life, whether in reality or just potentially, is something we avoid and act on.* Need for CONNECTION. There is very little, including reproduction, that we can achieve alone. Evolution has hardwired us to believe we can achieve much more by collaborating with others. We also need to feel emotionally connected to the world around us, to what we do in it (meaning), to who we are and who we might become. Isolation or exclusion, whether real or potential, are situations we instinctively fear and may go to extremes to avoid.* Need for CONSISTENCY. This need supports the first two. How do we spot threats to our control and connections? How do we spot opportunities to test and improve them? By constantly checking our surroundings ...",20 followers,Erin Patton,10.1K,1.5K,19M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-MIT-guys-hate-and-fight-with-KMC-guys

These are all very time-consuming activities, and I would not have been able to do them if I was public schooled, because of the amount of time spent in school. In addition, I've managed to complete all my schoolwork each year, and I've learned a ton.This year I graduated, and now I am headed to Hillsdale College, and I'll be part of the Honors Program (limited to only 20 people in my class). I guess all that is to say, homeschooling not only taught me well, but it also allowed me to have so many more valuable experiences.The socialization aspect often mentioned on the No side to this issue is a stereotype that is inaccurately applied to all homeschoolers. Sure, some may be quiet, introverted kids who have a hard time socializing, but then so may be some public-schooled kids. There are lots of homeschoolers who are extroverts and the life of the party at social gatherings, and some like me who are a little more shy but still able to socialize. I see people almost every night of the week; so I am hardly undersocialized. And I am just one example among many.Homeschooling is a great idea because it gives that one-on-one time with the child that really accelerates learning. It was really beneficial that I could go at my own pace in school. If I didn't get something, my mom could take an extra day or two on it to help me learn it better.Homeschooling also prepares you well for college. I took advantage of the running start program and did some community college work. I am now headed off to 4-year college, and at both places, I've learned that the ability to teach yourself is incredibly important. Ever since I was in 4th grade, I have been teaching myself in one form or another. Back then, it was mainly in Science Olympiad, not in school.Through high school however, my mom supplied me with the curriculum and I taught myself history. I also improved my learning with reading I do on my own free time. These skills will definitely help me in college. While I am not saying that public school does not teach these skills at all, many public schoolers that I have met cannot teach themselves. Some can, but many can't.I would say that homeschooling can provide all the advantages of public school, plus some. I am so thankful that my parents chose to homeschool me.Pros of being a homeschooled kidCons of being a homeschooled kidOther kids would probably have a different list, but these were the pros and cons of homeschooling for me. As you can see, the pros list CLEARLY outweighs the cons, and it did for me as a kid as well. I LOVED being homeschooled, I cried when I had to go to school in grade 2, every day actually until my mom pulled me back out. I was bullied when I tried school in grade 6 for a year and hated it.And don’t even get me started on high school, a combination of being so much younger than everyone else and feeling like a total fish out of water made high school very difficult for me. But I still had my good friends, my church youth group, and my home where I could be myself and that is really what got me through.Source:Please",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1K,9.8K,291.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-MIT-guys-hate-and-fight-with-KMC-guys

Now here’s my thoughts.Homeschooling is a better alternative to public-schooling, inIf the parents are intelligent, patient, and engaged in their children’s education, and willing to give up lots of time, homeschooling is the best option. You can personalize your child’s education based on their interests, their strengths, and their weaknesses.You don’t have to worry about ineffective teaching or poor discipline, you can tie it into your parenting and handle it yourself. I believe it was that personalized education that made school so easy for me now. My reading and writing skills have been higher than anyone else in the public-school since middle-school, all because my reading was encouraged and I had grammar pounded into me for years.My parents are also both very intelligent and patient with me. They donated the time to teach me and they knew what they were doing.THAT SAID, not everyone is cut out for homeschooling.There are sadly many instances where deadbeat parents used “homeschooling” as a cover for child neglect. They ignore their kids, teach them nothing, and in some cases let their kids starve. It’s horrible.So not everyone should homeschool, only people who can. How can we make sure that happens? Supervision.My family has always had a supervisor, who checks on our progress and makes sure we’re learning things. Every year we also take the same standardized tests as the public-schoolers, to make sure we are proficient in different subjects and keeping up with regular progress.This is one case where I welcome government supervision. If it means deadbeat parents can’t neglect their kids, it’s worth it.Overall, homeschooling is great when it’s done right. It just needs supervision so it","5,402 followers",Liz Deacle,637,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-have-you-changed-the-world

Parents have to be compelled to send their kids to public school. They have to be misinformed, to choose this. There are compulsory education laws in all 50 states. Thomas Jefferson advised against this whenever he could, but that is what we have today. What choices do parents have? What misconceptions have been accepted, without knowing. To me, Home School is the only logical choice.The information below contains some cold-blooded, factual reasons why no parent should consider entrusting their family, and their children’s future to a public school, or the culture of such a school. If you are faint-hearted, you should not read on.Nearly all public schools use some version of what is calledWere you informed when you agreed to go to public school, or to send your kids to public school, that this was a primary intention of the culture of the school, of the compulsory education laws?If I said to you that,Or would you agree these qualities are most important to the success of any individual, any family,any business or any economy, any civilization, and must not be intentionally lessened by the culture of any compulsory education system?How about an example: A study was done by Standford university, Dr. Terman, now calledSince that time this issue has been researched and the reason isolated, and techniques to return the student’s intelligence and all of his willingness to learn and understand each subject have been developed, tested and used throughout the world.Ideally an author would relay the ideas of a subject to students by communications. His or her idea is received by the student and then the student has those ideas, the content of the subject. But authors use words they understand, and the student may not understand the exact meanings of the words the author used, so the student misunderstands what the author, or teacher, intended.

26,In general I don’t like home schooling for a myriad of reasons. Here’s two just for starters: No parent has enough knowledge breath coupled with teaching skills do do a good job. As a consequence most “home schoolers” take a lot of on line courses.And two: kids need to be socialized. They need the complexity and challenge of social interaction and cooperation.,2 followers,Chuck Sears,5.8K,16.4K,12.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-have-you-changed-the-world

You don't have a large class full of other students to socialize and be friends with. My family got around this by joining a group of homeschoolers. Sports and other such activities can provide the much needed socialization that may be needed. But still, it could get lonely. With being home most of the day, one could easily become isolated.That is in no way to say that homeschooling is bad for that reason. I was homeschooled and I am so happy I was. I regret nothing. But, that isolation is something parents should be on the lookout for.",UNKNOWN,Anbazhagan Ambrose,764,3.2K,39.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-have-you-changed-the-world
