I’m really grateful to everyone and so I thought I could improve my answer a bit:)Let’s take this comic seriously and actually try calculate how much energy superman can produce.The first question would be:According to this comic strip,Superman just generated energy relevant toBut that’s just in a second. What is the maximum amount of energy he could produce?Superman's powers rely on his cells' ability to absorb and metabolize solar energy from yellow stars like Earth's sun.So next we would want to know the amount of energy the average star can provide. Fortunately, one of our friends on Quora has already answered this question for us:1.3 Quattuordecillion (10^45) Joules.1 Quattuordecillion is 1 quintillion times 1 quintillion. Now, if Superman decides he wants to drain all the energy from other stars and give it to us I think we’ll end up with more energy we can handle! But let’s calculate just for fun.There are about 100 billion stars in the observable universe. So we end up with a simple multiplication.Answer.Also, for the person who asked me what Superman's salary could be in the comic;First, In the comic, a scientist commented on the generator saying,The energy it generates will be so cheap, everyone can afford a western style of living.I think we can assume that everyone would have given up on competing in the energy market and Superman has dominated it, so Superman would at least be making 567 Quintillion joules a year.In a 6 hours-a-day, 5 days-a-week work schedule, he'd be making around 400 Quadrillion Joules an hour. That would be around $100 million!! Nice!But wait there's moreIn reality the surplus amount of energy will result in a decrease in electricity prices.According to the UNECE 2011 statistics the country with the poorest average annual income is Tajikistan at $247, and the energy bill in an average U.K. household is £1,264 or $1849(If energy prices are affordable to everyone, then the energy would be so cheap that even people at Tajikistan can afford it. So, whats 4% of $247? $9.88. 0.7% of the original price of electricity.Answer.If I get 150 up votes I might do the Flash too;)",1 follower,Atom Scott,2.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/I-have-been-accepted-into-penn-state-university-for-engineering-Can-you-tell-me-the-pros-and-cons-one-experiences-while-studying-engineering

Or so you think.As you’re carting Lex Luthor to jail after thwarting his latest plan, he questions you. He mentions Max Madden, an equally evil super-villain, who is never punished for his crimes merely because he chose to wreak his havoc in Guadalajara instead of Metropolis, which apart from the obvious advantage of being able to hire goons for seven cents on the dollar also has the advantage of not being your home town. Why should Lex be jailed and Max go free merely because of an accident in geography?At first, you dismiss Luthor’s prattling. Who is he to discuss morality? I mean, Christ, you’re Superman. Truth, Justice, blah, blah, blah. But you can’t avoid the nagging feeling that he may have something. How can you punish or save people based solely on who lives closest? Wasn’t it just this morning when you saved that boy from drowning in the Hudson, while 186 people died when a dam gave way in Taiwan? And yesterday, when you stopped a boulder from crushing that lady and her daughter in their car, a landslide killed 73 Koreans. How can you justify that?Well, you try. Your motto is about theYou’ve got a problem, but you’ve also got a 300 point IQ, so it doesn’t take long for you to come up with a solution. You decide that you’ve got to take a more Utilitarian approach. You have to perform the tasks with aSo, content with the notion that you are using your time much more wisely now you put your plan into action. Soon, you’re saving more people than ever, and you STILL find time to put the moves on Lois. Life is clear again.But one day, Lois finds herself being attacked in an alley. You race to a broom closet at the Daily Planet and begin to change into your Superman duds. That nagging feeling comes back. In that five minutes it takes to save Lois, you could diffuse a bomb which stands to kill 40 Jordanians. Now what are you supposed to do? You can’t just turn your back on Lois, but your time/ lives saved ratio goes right out the window if you start making exceptions for those you care about.Time for that Einstein IQ to kick in again. The solution is simple. All you have to do is vow to saveWell, you’re feeling pretty good about yourself until a few lobbyists come a-knocking. It’s all very well and good to save people from death, but what is becoming of the rape victims, the robberies, the torturing of prisoners in totalitarian regimes? Aren’t these things pretty bad? How can you draw the line at saving only those about to be killed? Of course you can’t. They must be stopped. You may have to quit your job at the Planet, but you certainly can’t sit idly by and let people be harmed. After all, Truth, Justice, et cetera...Well, you’re working overtime now. But they don’t call you Superman for nothing. You handle the job diligently, and you don’t even take off for New Year’s, missing the party on the Paramount backlot that Aquaman was going on and on about. You’re just starting to think that you’ve got the hang of this superhero thing when the ACLU wonders why only blue collar, violent crime is being prevented. What about the corporate crime, what about scams which take money from the elderly, the Bernie Madoff’s of the world, and the Martin Shkrelis of the world, pricing their drugs out of the reach of the lower and middle class?The scientists of the world are also coming at you hard. Sure you’ve stopped crime, but more people die of diseases in the world then by guns and knives. You’ve got a 300 IQ. Surely you can come up with a cure for most diseases. You agree, because Truth, Justice, whatever, and you start working on vaccines for plagues around the world.They say Superman never sweats (remember that Arid Extra Dry endorsement deal?) but your day is getting pretty full. Twelve hours of crime prevention, four hours of research into corporate crime, and six hours developing vaccines for the world’s most deadly ailments. You’re burning the candle at both ends, and you never get to your little cabin in the North Pole anymore, but you accomplish your task. AIDS, cancer, Coronavirus, everything.But life turns ugly pretty quickly. Sure, crime is no longer a concern, but you’ve created an even bigger problem. Now, thanks to you, only the elderly pass quietly away, and you’ve tripled the speed of population growth. Starvation, overcrowding, diseases, energy depletion, are being affected by your heroism. Within a year, things will become desperate.“What the hell???” you think. You are doing everything you can, but the world doesn’t seem naturally built for saving. And saving the human race is like a huge game of whack-a-mole. Beat down one problem, and another pops up in its place. You come to one inevitable conclusion.Superman cannot save the world.The only thing you can do is help people help themselves. But perhaps you can inspire them. Maybe you can show them how wonderful life can truly be. Help get people to involve themselves in life, not simply fight their way through it. Help them unleash their creativity, start schools, talk to neighbors. Help people express themselves creatively and have a voice in the world. Become a teacher of people rather than a savior. Because in the end, maybe the world can never be a completely safe place, but it can be a BETTER place.And you don’t need to be Superman to make it that way.","19,547 followers",Ariel Williams,536,2.8K,23.6M,https://www.quora.com/Which-superheroes-or-villains-are-using-their-super-powers-ineffectively-and-how-could-they-put-them-to-better-use

12,"I kind of agree with the ""all of them"" answer, because not only do writers not want to make characters too powerful, they also probably don't think as hard about a character's powers as someone with those powers would. IOW, if you had Iceman's powers, you'd probably spend a lot of time thinking about them and experimenting with them -- and figuring out how to maximize them. A writer can't put that much time into making a character more powerful, and probably wouldn't want that end result anyway.But some of them do stand out to me. Speaking of Iceman (and as mentioned elsewhere in this thread),I kind of agree with the ""all of them"" answer, because not only do writers not want to make characters too powerful, they also probably don't think as hard about a character's powers as someone with those powers would. IOW, if you had Iceman's powers, you'd probably spend a lot of time thinking about them and experimenting with them -- and figuring out how to maximize them. A writer can't put that much time into making a character more powerful, and probably wouldn't want that end result anyway.But some of them do stand out to me. Speaking of Iceman (and as mentioned elsewhere in this thread), he is manipulating energy (heat) at an atomic level somehow, and that's incredible -- much more impressive than making ice. If he could figure out how to access that energy manipulation directly, he would be the most powerful person on earth.The same principle applies to characters like Cyclops and the Hulk. When Cyclops fires his force beam, Newtonian physics say there must be a recoil -- which there isn't. Where does it go? How does it go there? Ask the same question with the mass that Bruce Banner gains and Hulk loses in their transformations -- where does it come from/go to, and how does it get there? Marvel's explanation is that the missing stuff goes to another dimension -- which means both characters can open and close dimensional portals. Right now they're doing it subconsciously, but if they accessed that power directly they wouldn't need force beams or great strength any more.Then there are characters like Invisible Woman and Green Lantern, who can create anything they can imagine out of thin air. The physics of that is hair-raising, so again figuring out how that works would probably lead to even greater power. But as is, they can beat anyone who breathes by cutting of their air, and any humanoid by blocking blood to the brain by imagining a ball bearing in their carotid artery.In Green Lantern's case, it's amazing that anyone can beat him. Even in the Silver Age, when fighting Goldface (a guy in gold armor), there was an astounding array of indirect ways to beat him: Cut off gravity beneath him, remove the earth's inertia and sling him across the solar system, cut off his air, dissolve the ground beneath him, and on and on. It just takes imagination.And since color is a perception of radiation absorption and reflection, would something still be yellow if you blocked light around it? It would be effectively black. Or heat the air around it until it changes color. Or bring a spray can and spray one spot black and affect that. Seriously, there's no way to beat a Green Lantern with a functioning brain -- which is probably why Hal Jordan got the reputation for being a little dim among comics fans, all of whom could imagine more effective ways to use the ring (and they could remember them issue to issue, which is something Hal Jordan didn't do, because then the strip would be boring).In fact, there's an argument that pulling on a green uniform and fighting crime as a superhero is the least effective use of the power ring. One can imagine a Green Lantern solving everything from cancer to the Mideast from his La-Z-Boy, with no one knowing where all those green miracles were coming from.Ditto with the Flash. A guy who can move at close to the speed of light can't be stopped with a cold gun. Captain Cold would be in jail before he was aware the Flash was present. And that's just if he uses the Speed Force to move fast -- if it was better understood, it could probably be used to freeze time or blow up planets.Or take Spider-Man's spider-sense. It means Spider-Man can, in some sense, see the future. If he could master that ability, it would be a lot more useful a power/weapon than a proportional-strength-of-a-spider punch!But the purpose of comics isn't to make the characters all powerful. It's to entertain. And the more problems and hurdles a hero faces, the more entertaining the story.

There's a reason that the classic ""Five Man Band"" model of The Hero, The Lancer, The Big Guy, The Chick, and the Other (a striker, a smart guy, whatever) is a trope. Characters generally fit into a group as a role. SeeSomeone like the Hulk or Hercules generally fit the same role in a group. They're The Big Guy. They represent physical power, and that's what they bring to a fight scene. Even in their solo comics, the way they generally solve their problems is in a Big Guy sort of way.The reason comics do it that way is because someone who can do literally everything equally well is boring and too powerful (see Superman in the Silver Age) because there's no drama.Now...The flipside is also true. When Grant Morrison took on the relaunch of the JLA back in the 90's, he was told that the JLA membership was going back to the ""Big Seven"" comprised of Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Flash, The Martian Manhunter, and Aquaman. To someone in 2015, Batman seems like an obvious choice, but back then you had some of the most powerful people in the DC universe on tap...why do you need Batman? A lot of Batman's ludicrously over-preparedness started coming into focus outside of Batman's own comic at this time, and hearkened in an age of writers coming up with creative thinking. This culminated with the ""Tower of Babel"" storyline in JLA, where it turned out Batman had elaborate plans laid out to take out every single member of the DCU, especially the JLA, in case they went rogue.But it's always fun to see when a good writer gets on a series. In Morrison's JLA, Wally West apocryphally made Barry Allen out to be a master of creatively using the wishy-washy physics of the comic book world (in the form of ""Flash Facts"") to do things like infinite-mass lightspeed punches that can be delivered a near-infinite number of times a minute to a target.On the other hand, some writers have tried to come up with in-universe explanations for why someone with X power can't do ancillary power Y. The explanation for this is usually something to do with ""Required Secondary Superpowers"" (which is also a trope; seeOne of my favorite characters who had the implications of his powers explored by someone else was Iceman. When Emma Frost was living in his head, she pointed out that Bobby had squandered his powers. He got defensive and pointed out that initially he wasn't so much ICEman as much as he was SNOWman with a slushy coating. She pointed out he clearly had no clue how his powers had to work. Keep in mind that to create the cold to freeze things, you areAnother one was Storm. One author pointed out that while Storm's powers explicitly protect her from the effects of weather (including heat and cold) it does so by overclocking or underclocking her metabolism. When she was stuck in the Arctic with Xavier and Cyclops, her body was dangerously overclocking her to try and fight the cold and it was killing her. In some cases later on, her vastly flexible metabolism was used on at least one occasion to feign death.

Leaving aside cancer research, he could have kept going and invented amazing biological (non-life-threatening) weapons or armor.Spider-Man should have been on a team or had a teammate decades sooner.  He did try to join the FF early on, and was propositioned by the Avengers in the 90s, was briefly on the Fantastic 4, but didn't join a team until sometime after 2003 (when my knowledge stops.)  Spider-Man is probably the BEST teammate a superhero could have.  One the one hand, he has the power and personality to go into the action and distract. On the other hand, he's smart and creative and can have a more strategic approach if there's time.  His Spider-Sense allows him to react quickly and he's great with spontaneity.In any battle, I would put my money on the side that has Spider-Man - not because he's the most powerful, but because he's the best team player.  He would have been a lot more effective in New York had he invested in finding a teammate - practically invincible.  (Don't get me wrong though, I love the loner Spider-Man.)I like what another use said about Batman keeping his opponents' weapons.

Let’s say we used the Wi-Fi(in reality we need a more reliable option) in the smart phone and make every control on the rocket accessible through this small network (Networking of this level wasn’t available at current speeds and at this scale back then).You discover that most of the resources of the phone will be wasted on handling the processing of inputs and generating outputs from/to the communication channel and that you are constrained by the speed of this communication channel which makes it the real bottle neck and not the computing power.The current model of computing inside a car is similar for current rockets (Distributed computing) with hundreds of small computing devices controlling small tasks with redundancies.The conclusion of this answer is that the computers on the moon landing did so much more than computing which makes replacing them with a smart phone just for computational power unacceptable. But the take of the difference in this computational power is that you can build pretty amazing and powerful stuff with a fraction of the effort it needed to be back then so pick up an Arduino or a Rasppery Pi on your way home (or just install Octave on your Android phone) and start experimenting and building amazing stuff (Rockets aren’t out of the question) and never believe that what you have isn’t powerful enough.,"21,733 followers",Glyn Williams,897,9.1K,53M,https://www.quora.com/Which-superheroes-or-villains-are-using-their-super-powers-ineffectively-and-how-could-they-put-them-to-better-use

One wrong calculation — and remember,The thing about the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) wasn’t just that it was among the best technology available at the time — it was — but more importantly, the hardware and software were as bulletproof as it was possible to make them. Thousands of hours had been put into testing them, because everybody involved knew that if it didn’t work correctly, people were going to die.The guy who is selling that $5 Solitaire app in the App Store did not put that kind of testing into his app.Adding to the cost is the fact that the number of customers for the “app” is exactly one. Someone selling a typical app in the App Store hopes to sell to thousands of customers, and so can charge a small amount of money to each customer. By contrast, if you’re contracting for software for a lunar lander, it has to be written for that spacecraft. Custom software gets very expensive.You’re also going to have to develop all the hardware that interfaces the computer with the spacecraft. The Apollo astronauts didn’t just key in numbers into the AGC and get numbers back out — in addition to crew inputs, the AGC gathered navigational information from the gyroscopes and accelerometers and used that information to perform complicated maneuvers by firing thrusters and engines. If you’re going to use an iPhone, you have to develop all this hardware.As the other answers have pointed out, no one would ever approve an iPhone for mission-critical uses like this — iPhones are not built to withstand the physical environment of space. If you’re determined to use an iPhone, you’re going to have to pay Apple to develop a specialFinally, nobody would ever consider building a lunar lander today that only had a single computer. We did it during the Apollo program because the computers were big and heavy and we were willing to take risks that we wouldn’t take today. Today a space agency such as NASA would no doubt insist on several iPhones, all running the calculations and communicating with each other. If one iPhone fails, the other iPhones can take it offline and continue safely. So now you’ve got to develop custom software so that the iPhones can communicate and synchronize with each other. More custom software, more expense.And all of this custom software and hardware has to be tested, tested, tested. And it has to have complete, detailed requirements, specifications, and documentation (Thanks,So yes, an iPhone has the processing power to run an entire lunar mission, without a doubt.
