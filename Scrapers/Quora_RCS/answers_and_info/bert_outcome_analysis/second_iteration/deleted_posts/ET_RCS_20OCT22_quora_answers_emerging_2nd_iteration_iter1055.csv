He isn’t viewed as a dirty cheater. Everybody thinks it’s fine. So what does your friend have against the use of algorithms?Or maybe let’s try a mathematical point of view.There are exactlyBut you ask “surely they can’t all be visibly different from each other? For example, if permutation A were to be just one more move from permutation B, wouldn’t A’s solution be only one move different from B’s?”And guess what; you are absolutely correct. As you try different scrambles and solve them, you’ll find that there is always a certain structure in a more efficient solve solution. Take the CFOP method as an example; It always begins with a cross. This is how an algorithm works.Algorithms are not out there to be used as a cheat method. Instead, they are out there to help you(You might have noticed how I especially highlighted the “easily”. This is because it is actually possible to solve the cube without algorithms. Instead, you could do what Google’s computers did: Generate a unique solution to every single possible combination.

DJT believes in being nice to foreign leaders who are nice to him - regardless of what is in the interest of the nation or its people. DJT cares about what is best for DJT, first and foremost.I have seen racists and white supremacists for years. Obviously, I disagree with what they stand for. However, white supremacists usually believe that they are fighting for a cause that is bigger than themselves. They believe they are fighting for their race as a whole. They often believe they are fighting for God. Whether or not they are or should be fighting for those things - they do believe. A racist has morals, but those morals are bad.Do you believe that DJT cares about a race of people - even if it is his own? Do you believe Trump could name 3 members of the confederacy? Do you believe that Trump would fight for God, or that Trump believes God would fight for Trump. Do you truly believe that Donald Trump has even once in 2017, knelt down and asked God for guidance or assistance? Has Donald Trump even once apologized for anything, or even admitted an error as president? I don’t know that Trump has any morals that extend beyond himself.Donald Trump knows who his supporters are. He knows who is for him and who is against him. He knows that his supporters support confederate monuments, and that the protesters who are against him are also against confederate monuments. It is easy to then assume that Trump likes one group because of their beliefs and dislikes the other group because of their beliefs. Trump cares about their actions - and specifically their votes. Donald Trump doesn’t like black voters collectively as a group. I have no compunction about making that statement. However, he dislikes us because we are against him - not because of our race or his morality (if any). If we showed him fealty first, he would have BLM and the NAACP over to the White House every month. In order for me to call Trump a racist, I would have to concede that he believes in something bigger than his reelection.

He has made dumb moves by the normal standards of human behavior and according to the objectives and criteria that most people use. If you love your country, it’s dumb to run for president when you don’t know anything, and have no coherent vision of where the country needs to go, and lack the ability to concentrate and work hard — and so in that respect, Trump is a disastrous example of the Dunning Kruger effect. But what if you don’t care about your country at all — you only care about yourself? What if all you want is attention and adulation? Then it’s not so dumb. Most people want to be seen as honest and honorable, and so it would be dumb for them to tell transparent lies; to operate despicable scams like Trump University and bribe the Attorney General of Florida not to look into said scam; to have a personal charity that’s a joke and a slush fund, and so on. But — what if you’re shameless and lacking all integrity, and you genuinely cannot distinguish between a truth and a lie — you consider the truth to be whatever is convenient for you in that moment? And what if you have the insight that a sizable portion of the American people don’t care whether you have a sense of honor or not? What if it gives them a frisson and a thrill that you are completely amoral: a hollering, bullying thug? What if you know that you could “shoot a guy in the middle of Fifth Avenue,” and your supporters would continue to worship you? It takes a special kind of genius to understand that huge numbers of people are THAT base, and THAT eager to have a king, a Third World strongman, rather than a US president. Trump has that genius; the rest of us do not.Trump rode that escalator down and launched his campaign saying of the Mexicans: they’re bringing drugs, they’re rapists, etc. And I watched in disbelief and said: Holy smoke! It’s Hitler! He’s just using Hitler’s tactics from Weimar Germany, blaming the Depression and Germany losing WWI on the Jews. Does he seriously think Hitler tactics will work in the US? And then I saw him sweep the Republican field with those tactics! And then, last November …He’s a reality show star, and he has turned our national discourse — and international politics — into a reality show, with lots of conflict and drama, all of it stressful, and scary, and empty, and signifying nothing. He played the news channels like a violin during the campaign. Every “dumb” and “disqualifying” thing he said earned him limitless air time. Real news and real issues in the campaign were not discussed. Russia was feeding him tidbits from the material they hacked and posted to WikiLeaks during the campaign — but they stopped when he attacked the Khans — a Gold Star family. The Russians concluded at that point that Trump was simply nuts and he could not win. But then — it didn’t seem to bother his supporters at all! And the Russians started feeding the Trump campaign Hillary-bashing non-news stories again. Trump, it turned out, was smarter about how low-down the American people are than Vladimir Putin, his mentor, head Watergate burglar and role model!I look at how Germany and Italy went fascist in the 1920s and 1930s — how two European democracies willingly committed suicide and became tyrannies. I look at how Augustus in ancient Rome claimed to have restored the Roman Republic when he had done nothing of the kind — he was just a military dictator. And so was every Caesar after him. I look at what Vladimir Putin did to Russia’s chance to become a democracy — and how much of Russia’s wealth he and his gangster friends have pocketed, (Putin may be the richest man in the world), and how popular Putin is with many Russians. I look at what Erdogan is doing to Turkey and what El-Sisi is doing to Egypt, and what Duterte is doing to the Philippines … These dictators may not have the genuine support of the majority of the people in their countries, but they could not have debased/degraded/destroyed democracy without the tacit consent of huge numbers of people; a sizable part of the population in each of these countries is willing to lose civil liberties and follow a demagogue who says “Only I can fix it.” I spent years studying Latin America, and I’d look at the overthrow of Allende in Chile, a strong democracy, and the installation of the military junta and General Pinochet. I’d look at how things like that went down in Brazil and Argentina …And I’d think: of course, that could never happen in the United States of America! Donald Trump knows better. Our Constitution may turn out to be too strong for him to triumph over in the end, but he has come much farther and closer thus far than I could have dreamed possible, and there is a good 30 - 40% of our population who wouldn’t mind a bit if he declared martial law, said we were in some kind of national state of emergency, and suspended the Constitution — especially the First Amendment. In that regard, Trump is much smarter than I am. We are in a kind of lull now, as we were during the first eight months of W’s presidency. We knew he was shallow and ignorant, and couldn’t talk in a coherent sentence, and was putting people in charge of departments they hated, in order to destroy those programs. We weren’t happy, but we got on with our lives. He’d do stuff like go on vacation for the whole month of August in 2001 and we’d think: well, that doesn’t seem like a good idea, but it’ll probably turn out okay …Then, a few weeks after his first month-long vacation, 9/11 happened. And he was able to spin that into a way to launch a lying war of choice in Iraq, and consolidate power, and earn re-election. Would Trump be able to do the same if his inattentiveness, incompetence and lack of adequate staffing leave us vulnerable and something equally disastrous happens? Or if he causes something disastrous to happen as a distraction from the “Russia thing” and as a pretext to consolidate power? I’ve worried about that a lot:Sometimes I think America would see through him and call him out in such a situation. I go back and forth about whether he could do it or not. But it is always a mistake to underestimate him.He has the brilliant insight that many Americans are happy for our democracy to commit suicide, and it never would have occurred to me that such numbers of citizens could value our Constitution so little! Every time he lies, it batters democracy. Every time he obfuscates, every time he attacks the press, every time he creates a false equivalency between partisan media without fact-checkers and the legitimate media that feature a separation of news articles and editorials and have real fact-checkers on the pay-roll — we move closer to becoming a failed democracy and a Third World country. And his supporters go right along with him. He’s smart enough to know they don’t give a rat’s ass about a separation of powers, a system of checks and balances and the ideals of the Enlightenment that our system of government stems from; I’m dumb enough to be surprised by their behavior, day after day.So, he didn’t fire Flynn, for weeks, though he knew Flynn lied. And he attacks his own Justice Department for the revised, bigoted Travel Ban he signed, and he makes nonsense of their case before the Supreme Court. And he doesn’t bother to hide that he’s trying to make money off of the office he holds and so is his family, and he could care less about the emoluments clause. And he says the House Republican healthcare bill is the best bill ever — and then he says it’s mean. And he leans on Comey about Flynn and himself, and he fires Comey and tells Lester Holt, and the Russians in the Oval Office, that he did it because of the Russian investigation. Were those dumb things to do? Only if he wanted to govern effectively. He doesn’t care about that — he can’t even conceive of what that means. He wants attention. He’s exposing himself as corrupt and as obstructing justice, but he doesn’t care about that, either. It makes for exciting reality TV! The talking heads are buzzing about it. It drives up ratings. Impeachable offenses emerge … and he knows that McConnell and Ryan and the rest of the Republicans will do NOTHING about them. They all care about the “truth,” and whether he is a Russian Manchurian candidate who has destroyed our national security and national sovereignty, about as much as Devin Nunes does. They’ll turn a blind eye to every sign of treason and colluding with an enemy power, and every impeachable, Constitution-degrading offense. Eventually, he’ll probably fire Mueller — and Republicans will turn a blind eye to that, too. Trump is trashing our system, but he doesn’t care about our system or our Constitution. As Mr. Khan pointed out, Trump has never read it. Trump has the wisdom of a psychopath to know that if you violate all norms and operate without a conscience, that very ruthlessness frees you in many situations, and gives you an edge over foolish, naively thoughtful people who are capable of empathy and who try to do the right thing.Republicans everywhere are learning from Trump’s example. Greg Gianforte body-slammed a mild-mannered reporter at least a foot shorter than he was for no reason. He threw the guy to the ground, shouting at him, punching him, choking him, and broke his glasses. Then he and his campaign lied about it to the police and presented the reporter as the aggressor.

I don’t think blowing it up would be an option, that would just cause a torrential rain of very large impactors. Or, there could be some idea that no one has come up with yet.I cannot say exactly what it would be or how it would work, but witness what NASA did after President Kennedy’s challenge to put man on the Moon within a decade - that was without the benefit of super computers (or an army of super computers); 60 plus years of space rocket science; 70+ years of atomic/nuclear science/physics. Further, witness what the astronauts and ground engineers did with Apollo 13 in saving the astronauts from certain death with just slide rules; brain power; and, duct tape.I will bet on mankind’s ingenuity to avoid an extinction event given any reasonable time.
