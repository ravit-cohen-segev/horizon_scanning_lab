1,"The Internet of things is the concept of every gadget that uses electricity having its own access to the Internet with its own IP address. The practicality of this in any general sense ha not been demonstrated, but it's the subject of a lot of hype. It's also a waste of IP address space, and a security nightmare.I once bought a LED lamp that allowed you to change its colors with your phone. But it didn't work very well, and one day the app was updated and I could no longer use it without opening an account with the manufacturer’a cloud service and giving it my life’s personal details.

I decided to switch to an “unconnected” plain light bulb instead. The manufacturer was Awox, it you want to know what to avoid, and I will never buy anything from them again.","3,743 followers",Evan DeFilippis,6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-%E2%80%9CInternet-of-Things%E2%80%9D-and-it%E2%80%99s-practically-use

This is no photoshopped image. It's real.Then where is its head? The piece in front of its feet?Mike’s owner, a farmer name Lloyd Olsen, wanted to have a supper with his family. His wife asked him to bring a chicken.Like everyone, Olsen chopped its head off first. But to his surprise the chicken didn't die. He missed the jugular vein, leaving one ear and most of the brain stem intact.Mike was able to stand and walDon't get freaked out!Because this is beyond what humans think is possible.This is Mike.Did you find anything weird about this photo?Of course it is alive.

Olsen fed mixture of milk and water through an eye dropper, and gave him small grains of corn.Unfortunately, in March 1947, 18 months after Mike’s beheading, he started choking in the middle of the night and died.Truly an amazing bird who lived 18 months or about 2 years without its head.Thanks!Source:",127 followers,Sachin Jha,2.7K,287,14.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-%E2%80%9CInternet-of-Things%E2%80%9D-and-it%E2%80%99s-practically-use
3,"The Internet of Things can be defined in many ways. In my opinion, it's a general term for connecting everyday devices with each other to form a dedicated network for data exchange enabling better use and control over the network's clients. For example. imagine your smoke detector connected to your smart phone alerting you when there's a fire whilst your away. Connected devices can change lives immensely and create a safer home. If you want to see an implementation of this for babies, home and energy monitoring with cool use of smart data, you should check out Evoz's platform (http://myevoz.coThe Internet of Things can be defined in many ways.
