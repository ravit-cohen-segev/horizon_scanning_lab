Whoo, I need a drink. Funny how much things can change in so short a time. Six months ago, I ran myself ragged to answer the question “how do I get into investment banking?” Now all I can wonder is: “How the hell do I get out?”_____________________ike every ambitious college student who ever watched “Wall Street” or “Barbarians at the Gate,” I wanted to be an investment banker. In between classes and crew practice, I studied The Wall Street Journal, the Harvard Business Review, and bootleg copies of The McKinsey Quarterly, dreaming of the day I, too could issue millions of dollars worth of AA-rated bonds to finance the mergers and acquisitions of multinational corporations. As anyone in the world of high finance can tell you, the investment-banking community is a clubby, insular fraternity. Insufferably snotty, their clannish recruitment procedures make membership in Phi Beta Kappa look about as exclusive as Price Club. I didn’t know it at the time, but there was no way I should have gotten my summer job. With hundreds of resumes battling for a dozen or so internship positions at each bank, I was working under some cruel handicaps.Ivy League BluesAn astute friend once observed that “I-banks would rather hire from the bottom of the class at Harvard rather than the top of the class anywhere else.” Alas, this is true. Most investment bankers are alumni of Ivy League schools, and recruit from their alma mater out of a sense of loyalty and nostalgia. In the process, they form an ensconced elite, who preserves its dynasties of wealth through selective recruiting. Old habits die hard, and the habits of money and snobbery die hardest of all.Grade InflationWith no means to subjectively evaluate the hundreds of applications a firm might receive, the first cut is a quick-and-dirty GPA cutoff. As a refugee from the Physics department, I wasn’t going to make the typical stratospheric grade averages. How can I dazzle them with my business acumen if I can’t even get an interview?Who's Your Daddy?Capitalizing on family ties is a time-honored tactic used by well-connected shiftless oafs since the dawn of human history. As is the case for most first-generation immigrant families, my potential nepotistic connections were left behind in a nation thousands of miles away.I didn’t have the pedigree, the grades, or the connections. Strike one, strike two, strike three. Thank you for your resume, Mr. Chang – don’t call us, we’ll call you. Fortunately, the game of life is not like baseball – it doesn't matter how many swings you take so long as you can send one soaring into the bleachers.Only question is: how?Gathering IntelligenceGathering IntelligenceWith publicly traded companies, one can tap 10-K/10-Q filings with the SEC, shareholders’ reports, and other sources of public data. I-banks (particularly regional boutiques) are generally set up as private partnerships, and their receptionists (the only source of corporate data outside of news clips from LEXIS/NEXIS searches) are notoriously tight-lipped.With publicly traded companies, one can tap 10-K/10-Q filings with the SEC, shareholders’ reports, and other sources of public data. I-banks (particularly regional boutiques) are generally set up as private partnerships, and their receptionists (the only source of corporate data outside of news clips from LEXIS/NEXIS searches) are notoriously tight-lipped.How can I scale this wall of information blackout?Enter reconnaissance. Through persistence, patience, and no small measure of luck, I secured a supply of in-house company newsletters form a prestigious investment bank (whose identity shall remain anonymous, for obvious reasons) and scanned it for useful information.Hmm, typical company newsletter blather – “Congratulations to so-and-so’s promotion to Partner,” blah blah blah, “So-and-so’s new baby is taking her first steps,” blah blah blah ... a-Bingo.I picked up the phone and called an old professor friend at the University of Pennsylvania for details – not about “Alex” (“Good morning, how may I direct your call?”“Alex Brown, please.”“One moment,”“This is Alex,”Showtime.I began my rehearsed speech: “Hi Alex, this is Donald Lufkin, calling from theInstant (albeit manufactured) rapport.In the subsequent “newspaper interview,” I tapped a motherlode of inside information: names and biographies of founding partners, office politics, recent and pending deals, whoAfter thanking him profusely, I left with a caveat: “Look, I’m a new writer, and I’m not sure if my editor is going to run this piece or not. If it does, I’ll send you a copy. In any event, I’ll call you whether the piece runs or not. Thanks again for all your help!”Resourceful reconnoiters cover all the bases.I spent the next three days composing a detailed cover letter to the managing director actually in charge or recruitment, detailing the company’s successful deal-making record, naming names, and congratulating them on their recent mergers and acquisitions deal. They must have been impressed – less than two weeks after I sent in my letter, I got an interview, ahead of several Harvard and Wharton students and the son of a U.S. Senator.“How did you know so much about our company?”I smiled cryptically. They didn’t call me “MacGuyver” back in high school for nothing, you know.A few weeks later, I began my career in the world of high finance. Nothing I read in the Wall Street Journal could have prepared me for what was to follow.Pledge Week in the Money FraternityPledge Week in the Money FraternityThe novelty of working in a prestigious investment bank wore off quickly. I-bankers work long hours to justify their obscene salaries, and the new recruits are pledges in this fraternity of wealth. “Face time” was important. Everyone was anxious to show off how much time they spent in the office.The novelty of working in a prestigious investment bank wore off quickly. I-bankers work long hours to justify their obscene salaries, and the new recruits are pledges in this fraternity of wealth. “Face time” was important. Everyone was anxious to show off how much time they spent in the office.This had its absurd moments. Analysts would arrive early, at, say, 6:00 a.m. and deliberately leave notes on managing directors’ desks like: “Came in to review financial models of equity repurchase of Company X – sorry I missed you. Talk soon, David. 5:16 a.m.” or “Need to review pitchbook data for fixed-income offering of Deal J before noon – URGENT. Michael, 4:57 a.m.”This was not what I expected. I entered this world to learn about business and finance, not play “busier-than-thou” games opposite ass-kissing nitwits. But it looks as though the new pledges must sing and dance before they are seen as equals.It has often been said that prestigious firms hire the same kind of smart people over and over again. It’s true: I can see it in my intern associates – every one of them an unimaginative, fearsomely intelligent young man destined to make piles of money doing the most absurd kind of nothing.What do I have in common with these workaholic psychos?What am I doing here?The Price of HubrisThe Price of HubrisI never understood the price of blind faith in spreadsheets until I was working on what was to be my last deal. The firm was representing the buy-side of the acquisition of a small software company in Silicon Valley. Part of an I-bank’s function in its M&A capabilities is the performance of what is called “due diligence,” where, in theory, the bankers diligently study the business to be acquired to determine its fair market value.I never understood the price of blind faith in spreadsheets until I was working on what was to be my last deal.

Part of an I-bank’s function in its M&A capabilities is the performance of what is called “due diligence,” where, in theory, the bankers diligently study the business to be acquired to determine its fair market value.Reality: The analysts and young MBAs are sent to crunch numbers while the managing directors go play golf with the CEO and executive staff.Work in a corporation for a while, and you know how information becomes increasingly obfuscated as it travels through formal communication channels. Practical curiosity being what it is drove me to make a few visits on my own to the firm we were supposed to be evaluating.In an information economy, the most valuable company assets drive themselves home every night. If they are not treated well, they do not return the next morning. These assets can never be boxed in a warehouse or conveniently quantified in an accounting ledger. Somebody should have reminded this fact to the investment bankers.As it turned out, a majority of the truly innovative coding the firm produced was really the work of two junior programmers. Like many creative people, they pursued a number of private projects (in this case, spin-offs and add-ons to the firm’s platform software product). Their requests for funding to help defray the costs of these projects were continually denied. I wasn’t surprised – a quick review of the senior management biographies revealed not a single trained programmer.They were the products of accounting, and finance careers, and saw employees as costs to be minimized, rather than investments to be nurtured.To the surprise of everyone else, three weeks after the deal was consummated, two “minor” employees cashed in their now-inflated stock options and quit the firm, leaving behind a half-completed source code that would ultimately take months for replacement programmers to figure out, a dozen pointing fingers, and mutual accusations of bad judgment. My analysis report on employee dissatisfaction with unresponsive management was left unread.I now understand why I’ve always mistrusted economists’ near-religious faith in numbers to quantify human transactions.A little management foresight and thoughtfulness could have saved the firm, but the leaders were convinced they could run a business through a balance sheet.Already disillusioned, I prepared my resignation letter. The firm was embarrassed, the client was left holding the smoldering ruins of an overvalued acquisition, and I, after two and a half months in the trenches, walked out of the office I fought so hard to enter with several thousand dollars and a hideously expensive Mont Blanc pen in compensation and bonuses.They say internships give you a good idea what you want to do after you graduate. Why, oh why do my internships always show me what I would hate?._____________________I loosen my tie and stare at the four empty shot glasses in front of me.

3,"I've interned/ worked briefly at 3 very diverse companies-Chai Point, a chain of tea stores that was at the time expanding in DelhiAnd most importantly- Social Cops, a tech startup which gave me my first taste of ""Startup Culture"", a feeling which I've been hooked onto ever since.Heres my experience at Social copsThe first thing that struck me when I entered the Social Cops office were the oddly positioned black and white photos with seemingly nonsensical captions on one of the walls.

I was wondering whether this was some kind of voodoo thing until my attention was diverted by Vikas, who was telling me about what I was going to spend my internship doing- couldn’t not pay attention to that.Well it turns out that every new employee at Social Cops is given a nickname- ranging from “Angry Young Man” for Varun Banka, and “Mama’s Big Boy” for Ashwin Ravichandran. And they were oddly positioned because they were arranged in chronological order of joining and according to the person’s height. So much for my Voodoo theory.Let’s rewind a little- 2 days before I started at Social Cops, I was interning at Chai Point (**or you could call it a chain of tea stores expanding in Delhi**). My work wasn’t challenging- I had a nice enough boss, but we didn’t work for more than a couple hours a day, and none of that work seemed important to the company. So I’m extremely glad I met Social Cops (shoutout toAs a business team intern, I pretty much dove into whatever they were doing. Our roles covered Marketing, Partnerships, Research and every other business development related thing you can think of. So from figuring out ways to promote ourselves through Slideshare and Quora, to researching on which companies would be best to partner with for generating scale in our projects, we were doing it all. I was extremely fortunate to have exposure to such a diverse spread of work, and I’m really grateful to my colleagues for mentoring me, and helping pull me up whenever I got stuck. Prukalpa is honestly the greatest, most conscientious boss you can work with, and I’d strongly recommend anyone reading this to see if you fit into any of the rolesEvery Monday, we have a meeting where we set weekly goals for ourselves- called OKRs. While I never achieved any of my OKRs- it is said that if you are able to achieve an OKR, then you set it too low- setting them helped give direction to my work week, and made me more efficient overall. I still use OKRs now for personal tasks, and I still never achieve any of them!At Social Cops, we aren’t expected to show that we’re working all the time- everyone has a natural rhythm after all, and personally, I work better in stretches of focus rather than hours of just sitting in front of a computer. The office had plenty of toys to keep me occupied- we have a parrot drone, raspberry pi, google glass, a playstation and free WiFi. We even have a dart board, smiley balls, and a thermocol spaceship for when we’re in the analog mood. Something for everyone!There was never an unstimulating moment at Social Cops. When we aren’t dodging bullets (of the nerf kind), we can be found distributing gyaan on anything from the Young India Fellowship, to which where to find the best beef in Delhi- our office is foodie heaven, and every time we go out on an office dinner (I’m making them sound fancier than they actually are), a lot of time is wasted spent making sure we go to an interesting place. I’d recommend any Delhiites reading this to check out Ivy and Bean, this lovely joint in Shahpur Jat. Oh and while we’re talking about food- I may be a pretty decent cook, but I’ll probably never be able to make Praateek’s cheese maggi.One of the highlights of the internship was the out of office day we had one Friday. The entire business team worked from Social Offline in Hauz Khas Village, and though Prukalpa and Vikas were sick of the music by 3 O’Clock (I guess it wasn’t as good as the Tech team’s playlist back in office!), it was quite fun working with a view of the hauz khas lake and deer park!One of the highlights of the internship was the out of office day we had one Friday.

When I reflect back on my internship, this feedback was one of the most important learnings I could get as it helped give me perspective on myself and on my work.While its definitely not for everyone, working at a startup is an incredible experience that I’d suggest you consider having. I don’t believe I would have got the depth of exposure that I got here had I done one of the “right” internships at a big consulting firm. Plus I probably would’ve gotten bored out of my mind.I can’t imagine a way I could’ve had more fun, or had better exposure this summer. I’ve met the most amazing people, and made great friends. I’m incredibly grateful especially to Prukalpa and Vikas for taking the time out to give me advice and mentor me.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.7K,9.8K,291.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-career-options-for-mass-communication-students

Moreover, the intern’s bed in the apartment they were sharing did not appear to have been slept in.Brief inquiries were made, and the intern was rapidly located, alive and well…at his desk.Turned out that, given his choice of summer internship, he’d pulled a couple of very late nights, crashed somewhere at the office, then stopped home briefly in the morning to shower (after the roommate had left for his own workday - presumably in an entirely different industry), leaving no trace of his presence in the apartment.So, thankfully, he was not the victim of some heinous crime.

I worked for the family, not the school. I worked with that kid for over four years, and I loved it. The family was always very nice to me and treated me like their own adopted son, even going so far as to help me find a new position when their son passed away and they no longer needed my services.After that client passed away, I took a job with the local school district. I also took other jobs as a one-on-one aide for various kids with various special needs, all of whom I knew through all of my years of working with my first client. A lot of parents were desperate for a male aide for their teenage sons. This was in Chicago’s wealthy North Shore area, and they were all willing to pay me well.By the time I moved on to a more “real” job, I’d been a special education aide for about a dozen kids via their families, and I’d worked at two different schools, also as an aide for students with special needs.But there was one family for whom I worked for less than a month before I quit. I hated every minute of my time working for them.They had four children: three boys and one girl, each with a different special need. This wasn’t a family that was doing God’s work and adopting children with special needs. These were their own biological children. They’d rolled the dice four times with children, and all four of them had some sort of major issue that would prevent them from ever living a normal life. The oldest had Downs with additional cognitive disabilities. The next two had severe autism. Both were nonverbal. One was self-abusive. The youngest, the girl, had severe cognitive disabilities.They lived in a huge house in a very nice area of a very nice suburb. The family was not lacking for money at all. I only met the father once. He was some sort of lawyer and worked a lot. The mother worked from home and did some sort of technical writing for a major pharmaceutical company. Her home office was the only part of their house that was clean. Everything else in their house was not just disorganized, but dirty, grungy, and sticky.It was because the kids were all under the age of 12, all had special needs, and all had a lot of energy. It appeared to me that the parents had just given up on trying to maintain any semblance of a normal, functioning family or clean home years earlier.I felt bad for all of the parents I worked for. There’s something uniquely tragic about having a child with special needs. I felt the worst for this family, though, especially because of how desperate they were to get someone to help them watch their kids. They paid me well, but I couldn’t last there very long. It was too chaotic. Too messy. Too physically and mentally draining. Each kid really needed their own one-on-one aide, and the family had the budget for it, but they could never find four people willing to do it at the same time.When I told them I couldn’t do it anymore, they understood and said that I’d lasted longer than most.I often wonder about those kids. That was almost 20 years ago now, so they’re all adults. If they’re not living at home still, then they’re in a group home somewhere. More than the kids, I wonder what happened to the parents.","8,267 followers",Vikrant Srivastava,1.2K,425,8.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-best-internship-you-ever-had
