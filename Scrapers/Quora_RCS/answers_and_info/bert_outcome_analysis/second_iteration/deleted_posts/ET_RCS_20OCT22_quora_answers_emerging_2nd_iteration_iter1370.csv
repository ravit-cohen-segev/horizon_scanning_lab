That’s GEICO.When I started having migraines and seizures, I went from doctor to doctor and nothing could help. It got to the point I had to quit a really good job because I was having daily migraines. Finally, insurance grudgingly referred me to a neurologist.The MRI showed pronounced bruising on the brain and evidence of previous bleeding.When the doctor prescribed some really expensive medication - it was denied by the insurance company as a “PREEXISTING CONDITION”. Never mind that TBI was pretty damn hard to diagnose in those days before MRI’s were commonly used.For the next three years, all my neurological care and prescriptions were out of my own pocket because PREEXISTING CONDITION. This went on until Obama was elected and got ACA in that eliminated pre existing condition traps which basically mean whatever the insurance industry decides it should mean that day.But there’s another trick they continue to use: prescription drug formularies. Your employer negotiates a set of covered drugs, called a formulary, for your health insurance. Most of your drugs will have a set copay - but it’s completely legal to add a drug by name and specific purpose - but it’s not covered at all by insurance. It’s still on the formulary.I was getting 34 botox injections in my head and neck every 3 months because it’s the only treatment that worked to prevent migraines. I went from 30 migraines a month to maybe 1 or 2. It was a miracle. My expensive insurance which I pay quite a lot for through my employer doesn’t cover it. So, that was about $1200 every time I went in, or nearly $5000 a year out of pocket.That’s where more fun occurs. Theoretically, you have an out of pocket maximum. The exception is drugs on your formulary for which there is no coverage. So, that $5000 a year out of pocket doesn’t count against my max out of pocket per year. It’s a double trap.That’s been some $50K out of my own pocket over the years where I’ve been denied healthcare that’s covered by insurance except that it isn’t because health insurance is a corrupt racket.",UNKNOWN,Another Former Republican for Democracy (AntiRu),897,2.1K,4.2M,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-American-citizens-ever-been-personally-denied-healthcare-in-the-USA
1,"My son managed to almost cut off his finger with a saw. Since he had no insurance he was told he would have to pay $1,200 up front before the Dr. would even begin to take a serious look at it. He went home and splinted it and bandaged it himself. It ain’t pretty, but somehow it healed well enough that he can still work! So not exactly a denial of healthcare, since he would have been treated if he could pay up front. Just standard treatment ( or is that no treatment? ) for the “essential” but uninsured or underinsured workers of the USA.",567 followers,Rachel Casale,7.5K,124,885.8K,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-American-citizens-ever-been-personally-denied-healthcare-in-the-USA

She walked in the room, took one look at me, and asked me why I wasn't in the hospital. I explained the insurance issue, and she told me that I had to go to a different ER and lie so I could be treated. It turns out that I had 3 blood clots in my lungs. They asked me who they could call, because they didn't think I would make it through the night. Obviously, I survived, butWhen my husband became a federal agent, I started being ignored and treated rudely at the hospital. I finally realized that our insurance card, which said government on it, was being mistaken for Medicaid. So I had to start telling them immediately that my husband was a federal agent, or they basically would have left me to die. I also started noticing how often they did this to other people. I am a former paramedic, so I know when something is a medical emergency, and when it is not. I would start up conversations with people who were being ignored, and I discovered that they were ALWAYS people who were either uninsured or insured through Medicaid. These people were critically ill, yet were the last ones seen. After 7 hours of waiting, many simply gave up and left. Meanwhile, young white people were being rushed back with minor injuries. Yes, these people were literally dying in the ER.Healthcare in the US is a joke. We are the only first world country that simply allows people to die because half of us are too stupid to realize that a single payer system would be cheaper than what we have now, and the other half is too selfish to care about other people.",0 followers,Gina Creedon,6.4K,5K,6.2M,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-American-citizens-ever-been-personally-denied-healthcare-in-the-USA

Eventually that debt was written off, but if she had not lied, she would have fewer fingers now.A friend recently resolved a problem for which he did not get proper medical care. He went to the hospital in intense pain, vomiting up even water. They did a scan, found nothing, and recommended a bunch of tests he could not pay for, and they would not do in the emergency room. Over the four month course of his illness, in constant excruciating pain and unable to eat solid food, he lost 50lbs and his job, and became effectively homeless, converting from an employed independent person to a couch surfer. He lost almost everything he owned, because he had no place to keep it. He finally passed a hardened mass from his intestines. He is still experiencing a lot of pain from the damage this mass did, working its way through the pipes, but he can eat solid food now, and is getting better. Intestinal blockage is a serious life-threatening problem, but without the tests he could not pay for, it was not a problem the hospital would address. He is a 6′3″ man who weighs 150lbs, but a month after passing this mass, he is back to working part-time every other day, and hoping to once again live on his own.My son is deaf in one ear from a burst eardrum, from an untreated ear infection, because he could not pay cash at the doctor’s office, and was not seen at the ER until it was ready to burst, which it did, while he was waiting there.The neighbor across the street died of a treatable cancer of the eye, because while he was selling everything he owned, including his home, to pay for treatment, it invaded his brain and gave him a stroke that killed him. Fortunately for the hospital where he died, he had a lot of cash on hand from the too-late sale of everything he owned, so they got paid for his three days of coma dying there.My mother got breast cancer when she was 45. She continued to work full time so her insurance did not lapse, but had to make the choice to sell everything SHE owned, and live on the streets for a year - while undergoing chemo, in order to pay the as-you-go deductible for the care that saved her life. Imagine that one: Enduring chemo on a park bench, and making it to work every single day anyway. She didn’t tell anyone in the family what was going on until it was over, out of shame.That is health care in America.",44 followers,Adam Strukel,2.2K,165,132.6K,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-American-citizens-ever-been-personally-denied-healthcare-in-the-USA

11,"All the time.In the past, people could be denied coverage, period.

People who got insurance through their employers were guaranteed a policy the same as everyone else in that company. But the 20% or so of Americans who were self-employed, or part-time or contract workers, were shit out of luck.Eventually that situation improved a tiny bit, with “catastrophic” policies, insurance companies being required to offer policies for high-risk patients. Catastrophic policies were more expensive than regular policies and had sky-high deductibles, so you basically were paying all your health care expenses out of pocket unless some catastrophe ran them up into tens of thousands of dollars (Hence the name.) I had one policy that literally covered nothing up to $5000. The policy effectively didn’t exist until that point. And most policies didn’t cover 100% after that.High risk patients might be limited to that, or to highly restrictive and expensive policies at best. There was a long list of disqualifiers, and if you had 2 or more, that put you in the high risk category. The listed included things like being more than 20 pounds overweight, and if you ever, any time in your entire life,had received psychological counseling. Didn’t matter if there was a reason (Mom died tragically and you needed help coping fro a few months) or the problem no longer existed (depression successfully treated.)Having always had the counseling-and-weight duo, I was unable to get regular insurance for over 20 years. When changing laws made slightly better policies available, they might have waivers attached. For example, Blue Cross once offered me a policy with a neurological waiver. That is, because I had suffered from depression, they would not insure anything connected to my brain or nervous system. Think about that: insurance that won’t cover brain cancer or nerve dysfunction. Just because I went to a counselor, because i was unhappy. They could disclaim any category they wanted to; high risk patients had no choice.Oh yeah, and insurance companies were notorious for maintaining service until you got sick, then cancelling the policy.The ACA improved on some of that. It is now possible for anyone in America to buy a policy, and companies can’t disclaim conditions on an individual basis. I will give the program credit for that. However the policies are hellishly expensive (My last non-ACA policy was 700 a month, my ACA was 1000), although poor people get financial aid. But the middle class doesn’t. (That 1000 a month is 12000 a year, so figure you had to earn about 16000 just to pay the insurance bill after taxes. Middle class policies were also on the catastrophic mode. They did cover some basic heath maintenance—again, I’ll give the ACA credit for that—but deductibles for pharmacy were separated from the regular deductable, and both were sky high. We’re talking, $6500 for many basic middle class policies. So, if you had a moderate middle class income, the amount of money you might have to pay in a given year BEFORE insurance paid for anything was 12000 premiums and 13000 for deductibles. THAT is the problem with the ACA. It is focused on poor people, but if your income isn’t low eough to qualify, it just throws you under the bus. One man reported that he and his wife brought in $75000 a year, and between premiums and deductibles, they had to pay out 35000 before health insurance covered anything.And that is the issue with the ACA: it is focused on poor people, and totally screws the middle class.And since roughly 80% of the country never encounters this problem, and thinks they never will, they don’t give a fuck. That is why we don’t have some kind of universal health care. 80% of the country—including every single politician with the power to change the system—not only has no need to change the system, for the most part they have no understanding of why its needed. Politicians have even made statements about how getting 80% of people covered is a reasonable goal. There is an entire rank of American society that has been judged “not worth worrying about.”And to wrap up my actual answer, any insurance company can dodge paying for any procedure or medication by declaring it “unnecessary” or “experimental.” My ACA policy will not cover any experimental procedure, a category into which they can shoehorn any brand new procedure. Which means that if tomorrow a treatment for Alzeheimers were approved, they could theoretically refuse to pay for it . Many policies won’t cover name brand drugs, so anything new to the market is not covered.Any time someone asks why the system is not improved, just remember that 80%.Thank you for reading my rant.",5 followers,Kristin Thomas,4.6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-American-citizens-ever-been-personally-denied-healthcare-in-the-USA

Whatever it is, the recommended minimum course of action is to remove that ovary.Why is a 49 year old woman working a job with such crappy insurance? Because fifteen years ago, her husband, who had juvenile diabetes, went into kidney failure. He had an unusual tissue type, so even though he was on the transplant list, they were told that his best bet was probably to find a genetically related donor. Everyone in his family that could qualify as a donor was more than ready to volunteer but none of them was a close enough match. He lasted for seven years on dialysis, growing increasingly more disabled and, in the last three years of his life, needed constant care. Which wasn’t adequately covered by Medicaid, so my friend quit working to take care of him. She drained her financial resources to make it possible.He died, still waiting for a kidney. She was the one who had to make the decision to pull the plug.She was left in a very bad position, financially. She lost their house because she couldn’t make the mortgage payments. She also had an elderly father who dreaded going into assisted living or a nursing home and asked her if she and her adult son would move in with him to care for him so that he could live at home. Due to her financial situation, she and her son (20something) agreed.She and her son coordinated their working hours so that one of them could always be at home with Dad/Grandpa. Everything was going well for a few years, she had a good manufacturing job that paid quite well and had good insurance. Then she suffered an accident on the job due to unsafe working conditions. She was hospitalised for nearly two weeks, it was close to three months before she was cleared for light duty again, OSHA got involved and the company fired her as soon as they could come up with an excuse that had plausible deniability that it was connected to her workman’s comp claim—supposedly she was creating a hostile work environment… even though her alleged victim testified that she did not feel threatened, picked on or bullied in any way, that in her alleged victim’s view, the remark (which had nothing to do with racism, religion or any other protected category) was a shared joke.Nope, had nothing to do with the fine OSHA had levied on the company in relation to my friend’s on-the-job accident, nothing at all. It was all due to her inappropriate verbal interchange with another woman in a predominately male environment about what being able to lift a heavy crate might imply. The other woman was not disciplined. That would have undercut her designated role of victim, I suspect.As all this was going on, my friend’s father was gradually declining. That’s what often happens when humans reach their late eighties. My friend initiated a lawsuit against her former employer but she was emotionally wrung out. Her lawyer was on contingency and very encouraging but could not completely protect her from all the legal demands, of course. My friend ended up accepting a lowball settlement offer that left her with less than $10K in her own pocket. Her lawyer was certain that if she turned it down, the company would come back with a better offer but my friend was just emotionally worn out.Due to the substantial employment gap and the firing on her employment record, my friend found it difficult to find work at her previous income level, at least finding work that would allow her to coordinate with her son’s hours so they could care for her father. She was making less but since she didn’t have to pay for shelter or utilities, she could scrape by on less.She found her niche, though. Working in the healthcare field. Her experience caregiving for her late husband and her father gave her tons of hands on experience and unusual insight into the issues faced by people with disabilities. The pay was crap but taking care of others was deeply satisfying to her. Especially after covid hit. She was an essential worker but, of course, she still wasn’t paid like she was essential. Better than fast food but not that much better.Then two things happened. One is that her previous employer decided she could not flex her schedule to accommodate her father’s needs, so she quit. Her father had to come first. Not a problem, she was immediately hired at a local hospital… well, not by the hospital, by the company that contracted to provide services to the local hospital (put a pin in that).The other thing that happened was that her father’s slow decline intensified. He had been showing symptoms of minor memory loss for years, consistent with age but now it was noticeably increasing. His doctor thought he might have had one or more transient ischemic attacks but diagnostics were unclear between that and Alzheimer’s.He had always been a gruff old man but he started into grumpy territory. He started to become more like handling a toddler—he wanted what he wanted, how he wanted it and he always wanted it now. Reality be damned, if he wanted to do something, he wanted to do it no matter what. He started suffering from falls because he would intermittently decide he hated using a walker even though he had severe foot pain from gout, for instance.One day in July, during an extreme heat wave, he decided he wanted to mow the lawn. He had a riding lawn mower and the grass was in hibernation due to drought and heat but he wanted to mow it. So he got on the mower and started mowing. My friend took the opportunity to clean the house (which irritated him if she did it when he was present) but kept her ear on him. She noticed after about fifteen minutes that the sound of the mower was coming from one place for too long, so went out to check. He was circling in the street, still conscious but clearly not completely cognizant of what he was doing.She got him inside, called 911. He went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a heart attack. He died later than night.Her father wanted to divide his assets evenly between my friend and her brother. He specified that his house and any assets not specifically bequeathed were all to be sold and the money divided evenly. My friend feels this is far—I don’t, since it does not take into account the 16 hours/7 days per week both my friend and her son had been putting in to keep her father out of a nursing home (her brother did nothing but offer advice of the “you’re doing this, that and the other thing all wrong” type). It’s her life, though, not mine.This leaves her in a jam. She has to vacate the house, she doesn’t have enough income to rent a house on her own and she has two cats and a dog. Fortunately, she and her son get along great, so he wants to continue to live together. If they can find a place that accepts pets, she thought she could put her life together. Again.Meanwhile, I had been bugging her because she was having a symptom of what she thought was perimenopause—periods that were increasing in length until she was having one long period with a few days of respite. This is not an uncommon condition in perimenopause and there are various treatments…Finally, to get me off her case, she made an appointment to see a doctor. And found out that it wasn’t something that a simple D&C or uterine ablation or medication could treat—it looks suspiciously like ovarian cancer.And that is when she discovered that her medical insurance through her work only covers preventative care. A very limited amount of preventative care. She works in a hospital but she doesn’t actually work for the hospital, she works for a company that contracts to provide services to the hospital. And that company provides lousy insurance that covers the legal minimum under the ACA. Paying for a biopsy (which is not advised under her particular situation) or ovarian removal (the recommended course of action) is not covered as preventative care. Her doctor is certain that if the ovary is not removed, it will become cancerous if it isn’t already.Yeah, she’s still an essential worker but not essential enough to give life saving preventative medical care to.She has already checked to see if she qualifies for Medicaid. Nope, she makes less than a thousand dollars too much to qualify.Republicans throw around the phrase “death panels” like that is what will happen with universal healthcare. They refuse to admit that death panels are the system we’re already living with right fucking now. If we had a healthcare system that actually served the people of the US, why, the über-rich might lose out on the latest, coolest toys.

After more than a month, they still wouldn’t consider having the procedure done. It was miserable, depressing, time-consuming and painful. It made a significant dent in our limited fertility window. Then we had to wait another 3 months before trying again. After I got pregnant again and my son was born, I left the company I was working for and switched to my husband’s insurance company. I had another miscarriage. They allowed me to have a D & C within a week. The whole thing was over right then and there. I was better within a couple weeks. We could mourn and get on with our lives. I was never able to carry a pregnancy successfully to term after my son was born. We ran out of time. That denial was over 15 years ago.

21,"Data Scientist is necessarily more strategic; whereas, the Machine Learning Engineer is going to be a more tactical role.Data Scientist is necessarily more strategic; whereas, the Machine Learning Engineer is going to be a more tactical role.From a training perspective, the Machine Learning engineer requires much less training — deep as it may be. A Data Scientist may have to have more training (breadth of exposure) and a greater sense of intuition about the real world because their role is more cross-functional and intersects multiple domains. A Data Scientist with a deep quantitative background could replicate a Machine Learning engineer, but a Machine Learning engineer cannot replicate the Data Scientist so easily, because it involves some business skills which are not easily simulated/taught in a classroom.Simply put, a Data Scientist translates business problems into the scientific domain, and sets up the framework for a data-driven solution. A Machine Learning engineer is not likely to be trained for this, nor will they be able to readily do this without a lot of experience. Again, it really depends on the specific educational background of the person and their particular strengths.By their very titles, ‘Scientist’ and ‘Engineer’, we can expect that the ‘Engineer’ role must be subordinate to the role of the ‘Scientist’ — an Engineer has a more well structured workflow. A Scientist has to deal with more ambiguity, given that the primary function is research, formulation, and framework development, as opposed to build.Functionally, there is a huge value in creating a hierarchy and sequence for these roles, because it allows you to source talent more readily, plan appropriately, price for value, and align individuals more appropriately to their strengths. Correctly aligning people with their strengths and expectations also fuels long-term retention and job satisfaction.So contrary to this egalitarian new age myth of the flat organization, titles are not meaningless or arbitrary (i.e., shouldn’t be), they serve a vital function — they explain","26,866 followers",Rohit Malshe,1.3K,327,11.4M,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-American-citizens-ever-been-personally-denied-healthcare-in-the-USA
