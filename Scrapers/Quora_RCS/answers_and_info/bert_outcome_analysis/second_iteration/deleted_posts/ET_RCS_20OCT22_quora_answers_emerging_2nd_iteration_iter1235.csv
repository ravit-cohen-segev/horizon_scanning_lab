1,"I would like to suggest that the central issue is that we’ve decoupled the business decisions our universities make from the risk of those actions. Let’s be clear: student loan debt isn’t high for any other reason than universities charge vast sums for tuition.

Not so in education - there, as universities raise wages and administrative spending, the net result is that students simply take on more debt…schools are thus free to charge whatever they like, without fear of repercussions. Compounded over a generation or two, this is the root cause of the outrageous student loan debt in America.I believe the Wuhan virus pandemic may offer an important lesson here.We’re told by our most esteemed universities that online distance learning can replace in-classroom education with no loss in educational quality. Let’s stipulate that this is true for argument’s sake.Now, if students can learn online, it suggests that it should be possible to create a basic online curriculum at the national level that could be provided to students at a small fraction of the price of current universities.Imagine some national entity (say, the Department of Education) creating an online catalog of hundreds of courses at pennies on the dollar compared to traditional university tuition. Tens of millions could be given college education at substantially less expense than paying tuition, and therefore the requirement for student loans drops dramatically.Indeed, even if you wanted a degree from Harvard, perhaps all the boring core curriculum stuff gets done online at a small fraction of the cost, and your four-year Harvard degree drops in cost by half.This reimagining of higher education is not that big a leap, and it would be an interesting way to educate anyone that wants to learn at a cost that wouldn’t cripple students.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.4K,9.8K,291.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-scholarships-that-can-help-Indian-students-to-pursue-a-masters-in-the-US
2,"Let’s start by identifying the problem correctly.The federal system of student loans is fundamentally flawed.The government insists on giving student loans to any student who manages to graduate high school, regardless of their academic ability or what they intend to study.The result of this foolish, egalitarian policy is that most borrowers will never get a job that will pay enough to make their loan payments.Half of Those Matriculating Today Aren’t College Material.Employers want graduates who can write a coherent paragraph, speak extempore, interpret qualitative and quantitative data, and dLet’s start by identifying the problem correctly.The federal system of student loans is fundamentally flawed.The government insists on giving student loans to any student who manages to graduate high school, regardless of their academic ability or what they intend to study.The result of this foolish, egalitarian policy is that most borrowers will never get a job that will pay enough to make their loan payments.Half of Those Matriculating Today Aren’t College Material.Employers want graduates who can write a coherent paragraph, speak extempore, interpret qualitative and quantitative data, and do research.To acquire these skills, a student needs to have above average intelligence and be highly motivated. With forty-five percent of high school grads going on to college, more than half of them don’t fit that profile.I was a mediocre high school QB. When I went to college, I had the good sense not to embarrass myself and waste everybody’s time trying out as a walk-on. I would have been rudely dismissed from the field in fifteen minutes.However, when it comes to “academic walk-ons,” it doesn’t work that way. The situation is so bad, twenty-five percent of those who matriculate need remedial classes before they can get started in college.Make a wild guess. Why do you think most colleges and universities actively “lead on” academically mediocre students?We don’t need more students attending college. We need, on average, more academically qualified college students.Two Thirds of Those Matriculating TodayForty percent of those who matriculate will drop out.Twenty-six percent of them will graduate with some kind of degree or another, but find they can’t get a job that requires a college degree because the market is saturated, i.e.The Quality of a College Education Has DeterioratedSixty years ago only 7% went on to college.

5,"I don’t see how we can eliminate what we have collectively already borrowed and agreed to pay back.I don’t mind expanding loan forgiveness programs if they are attached to jobs that can be of societal value though.expanding loan forgiveness programs to doctors who go into primary care and move to poorly served areas seems like a valuable way to serve and forgive debt.

Same with law school debt for public service and social related legal work.But those are strategies for bailing out water. We need to plug the hole also.I think there is a great need to teach students just what it means to borrow money. It is beyond me that we teach pre calculus and calculus but we rarely ever teach students what it means to amortize a loan. Students borrow money and have no idea how long it will take to pay back and how much they will actually pay back.I know they aren’t aware because I began teaching a class called “math applications” specifically to teach those kinds of skills. The kids who understand what they’re doing on the spreadsheet are uniformly shocked at how much college will cost them.this needs to happen before anyone borrows money. If I were in charge of policy around loans I would require all students to take a test, similar to a driving test, so that they can prove that they understand just how much they are borrowing and what it will mean.I used to be of the opinion that people should study whatever they want. Now I’m no longer sure. It seems to me that if students take out a government loan at a subsidized interest rate then it is acceptable for the government to stipulate that a subsidized loan can only be offered for particular majors. If you want to major in theatre that’s fine but why should the government, and by extension the tax payers, pay for that?I think people would make different choices if they didn’t get a subsidized loan which would be in their best interest. The idea of a hundred grand in loans for a degree that will not offer any return on the investment is a mistake and 18 year olds should not be incentivized to make that kind of mistake.","114,999 followers",Daveed Phoenix,558,9.9K,159.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-best-way-to-reduce-eliminate-the-1-6-trillion-student-loan-debt-in-America
6,"Clawback provisions between the primary lender (usually the federal government) and universities.Something like:“Should the student default on their student loans within 20 years of graduating, for reasons other than their own death or permanent disability, the remaining balance of the loans shall be charged to the institution that accepted the loan for educating the student.”The charge would be in the form of a fine.

The alumni would still have the outstanding debt on their record. They aren’t being bailed out of their debt. The school is being forced to have some “skin in the game” for giving out overpriced, worthless degrees to under-qualified people.My wife and I still have student loans from when we were in college 20 years ago. Our alma mater got that money back when we were students, and we’ve been paying it back (and then some) to the federal government ever since. Our alma mater has no skin in the game anymore. If we pay back our loans or not, it doesn’t affect our alma mater one bit.And that’s the main problem: universities can charge whatever they want for whatever degree they want to whatever caliber of student they want, and it won’t affect their bottom line, as long as the government provides the student with a student loan. There is no risk to the universities if they overcharge students, over-promise the value of certain degrees, or under-prepare students for the working world. Adding risk will make universities more cautious about their customers, products, and prices.“Do we really want to let this C-student take out $150k in student loans for a degree in Music Appreciation? If, in the very likely event they don’t make much money appreciating music post-graduation, and struggle to pay back that $150k, we may end up having to give it back to the lender. Perhaps we should charge less for this degree, or raise the standards for who we let into the program…”",429 followers,Sukru Tikves,854,298,861.6K,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-best-way-to-reduce-eliminate-the-1-6-trillion-student-loan-debt-in-America

Most of the profits go to the system provider and the educational facility.Hidden Payments Industry That Is Growing RapidlyToday this is still a fragmented industry.  There is a drive for consolidation and the momentum is taking hold.  One of the growing leaders and growing larger every year, with few  challenges is Heartland Payment Systems, of Princeton, New Jersey and their Campus Solutions division.   There of course are others, for example Oracle Financial systems is also a large player but does not offer the wide ranging systems to effectively compete with Heartland.  They are primarily a backend system, however Stanford University's SU PCard is operated by Oracle.  Oracle is looking at becoming more competitive  in this space in the future so I would not count them out.Heartland's Campus Solutions was really formed by the acquisitions of General Meters Corporation in October 22, 2007 and School-Link Technologies, Inc. in October 11, 2011.  General Meters Corporation had a significant portion of many state and private Universities when they were acquired.   The School-Link Technologies, Inc acquisition expanded a market reach to K-12 school systems, both public and private as one of the largest companies in this segment.Rather dry marketing overview of the OneCard product.Rather dry marketing overview of the OneCard product.Heartland created the OneCard system as a customizable solution for just about any education environment. However, there is far more then just Payments involved with these solutions they are really quite complicated and all encompassing. This really creates very high barriers to entry into this market.  There is also a very difficult and long vetting process that most education environments require.  There is always going to be competitive bidding, however on some contracts it is only Heartland bidding since few players offer the depth of product offerings.How Does Campus Solution’s OneCard System Work?In a typical scenario the student is issued a private label Discover debit card issued through the Central National Bank.  This is a prepaid debit card for each student to make on- and off-campus purchases.  They must meet and satisfying Title IV, Regulation E and PCI requirements.Students have mobile and web access to their Discover card information, transaction history and transfers to other accounts through the online portal.  This speeds up the receipt of financial aid refunds 5-7 days sooner than with traditional checks. The debit card anywhere Discover cards are accepted including ATMs.Rather dry marketing overview of the dining aspect of the OneCard product.Rather dry marketing overview of the dining aspect of the OneCard product.The University has back office tools to calculate the direct awards, excess disbursement amounts and payroll distributions, then prepares a simple ACH file and submits it to the bank to load student debit cards.Online & Offline Bookstore ManagementYour Smartphone Is Your Student ID CardThey recently upgrade the system to ultimately fully implement the use of  smartphones. MyPay is a virtual student ID card in lieu of their physical ID.  The MyPay app enables students to make on-campus purchases at bookstores, vending and laundry machines, dining locations, print and copy stations, and more.MyPay can send payment information to the point-of-sale terminals while waiting in a checkout line, allowing cashiers to simply press a button to complete a transaction.The MyAccount is like a bank account app and enables students to manage their OneCard account, check balances, report a lost/stolen card, add funds, purchase services such as campus events, meal plans or parking passes, as well as upload photos for the student ID system.The OneCard Mobile Admin gives the ability to manage the OneCard System from a mobile device with administrative features including viewing student card use information and managing building and room access control for additional security.Revenue ModelHeartland generates revenue from a number of direct and indirect sources.  The Off-campus merchant program has no cost to educational organization and it allows the surrounding town to directly participate in the closed loop side (non Discover) of the OneCard.  This certainly creates a “preferred” merchant list for students and will drive significant traffic to participating merchants.  Merchants can pay from 1.5% - 3% with some commissions returned to educational organization.  There is also the Give Something Back network that allows for fundraising built around the OneCard network and participating merchants.Heartland also generates revenue from the hardware sales, software sales, support, services, etc.  In most cases these systems support themselves by the direct and indirect revenue stream generated for educational organization.Just One Of The Hidden Opportunities Startups In Payments Are MissingI am neutral on Heartland as a company.  There is now doubt they have made significant mistakes in the past.  However Campus Solutions is a brilliant move into this huge market and they have years of head start.As I mentioned there as a bit of a roll up taking place in this sector.   I seem to always surprise Analysts and many startup companies when I point out use cases like this.  Billions of dollars are running through these private networks and most observers in Payments, investment community and the tech media do not notice.There are many other examples that are similar that have just as large of a market potential and not a single new Payments Startup has noticed (I confirm this on a weekly basis).  While most of the startups in the Payments space are focused, rightly so on making the best possible experience and reaching for the lowest hanging fruit on the trees, some of these companies are fully ignoring huge market opportunities because they refuse to study history and value wisdom from industry experts.  By steadfastly wanting to reinvent the wheel all over again and not working with people that really know this stuff, potentially large markets drift by like ships in the  night.In the next few years we will see these types of payment solutions morph to far larger systems with even more opprotunities.","358,196 followers",Sean Kernan,5.5K,5.6K,723.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-best-way-to-reduce-eliminate-the-1-6-trillion-student-loan-debt-in-America

That's what children do. They don't think too hard. They just chase whatever butterfly catches their interest.For example, I went to my friend's apartment to hang out, and I met his room mate. Out of habit of course I asked him what he did, and he said he programmed at Google.Ok. Cool. But I don't particularly care. I can ask him about that anytime. Also I already knew a couple of engineers at Google.However, in his room he had dozens of posters of anime girls. Like this.Including one on his bed.The first lesson about asking interesting questions young padawan: don't make any assumptions and make them as open as possible.Questions I could have asked:Do you like anime? (This is bad because the answer space is yes/no which kind of backfires and starts awkwardly if the answer is no or not really.)Where do you get all of these? (I don't particularly care where, honestly.)Personally I like stories. And most people do too. So I asked him.What's the story behind all of these posters? (Because when you ask people to tell a story, i.e. their interpretation of a sequence of events, it reveals a lot about their personality, outlook, level of optimism/pessimism/etc.)And he said, well, my mother sends me one of these every month saying that she found me a girlfriend. And he said this with a rueful smile in a half joking tone. Slowly shaking his head back and forth.And now I don't care who you are, but this is a way more interesting start than asking about the bikes at Google. The conversation that followed was of course extremely memorable.EDIT: I thought it would be fun(ny) to help this guy get a girlfriend. Also I help people out. It's what I do.

If you want to remember people’s names that you just met, simply REPEAT their name back to them and allow them to confirm it. Once they confirm it, say it to yourself a few more times. Now say it again!Afterward, throughout the conversation feel free to use their name when applicable. Doing so demonstrates to the other person that you have been listening to them. Doesn’t it feel good when somebody remembers your name?People love to talk about themselves. Ask genuine questions about the other person’s interests, goals, or career. Remember to actively listen to how they respond. We as people love to know that we are being heard.Don’t ask questions that lead to a dead-end. That’s how you cut a conversation short and worry about what to say next. To keep a conversation going, ask questions that can be answered more broadly and not just with a simple yes or no. Questions such as “What do you typically like to do on the weekends?” or “What’s it like working for that type of company?” work great.Before ending the conversation remember to ask the person if they would like to connect. It can be exchanging numbers, Facebook, email, or whatever you decide. Make this a habit at the end of your conversations.

After you've initiated contact, make it about them. Ask them a question they'd want to answer. Where I've failed is when I keep trying to hog attention (IE - Be funny or cool guy).
