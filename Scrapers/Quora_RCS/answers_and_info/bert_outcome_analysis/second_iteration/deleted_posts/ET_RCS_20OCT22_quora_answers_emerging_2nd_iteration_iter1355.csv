6,"I think that what President Trump was trying to say was something like: “New Zealand is supposed to have had success against Covid-19: this was widely reported with the intention of making me look bad. But look, the disease has had a resurgence in New Zealand, so by comparison we look pretty good.”That is intelligible, though badly wrong on several counts.NZ did manage to go a little over 100 days without any new cases, which was great, and achieved by a combination of good fortune and a major communal effort. I don’t think anyone who had a clue thought that we were definitively out of danger.I think that what President Trump was trying to say was something like: “New Zealand is supposed to have had success against Covid-19: this was widely reported with the intention of making me look bad.

I don’t think anyone who had a clue thought that we were definitively out of danger. Certainly no one who was paying attention to the Prime Minister thought that, because she said, on more than one occasion, that it was all great, but there would be more cases and we had to keep alert.There was probably a bit of complacency, and a lot of seriously badly organised administration of the border isolation facilities. This didn’t help, but the authorities still haven’t managed to work out where the new outbreak came from. The opposition is attacking the Government over the administration of the border, but interestingly their announced policy is essentially a continuation of the present very strict controls; they just claim they would do it better. There is no hint of the general freeing up of restrictions that many in business want to happen.There is a fresh outbreak, in Auckland we have gone into almost lockdown, and it’s a disappointment. But if President Trump wishes to make comparisons, we ought to make sure people in the USA get a sense of the relative seriousness of the events.This morning I was talking to a collaborator, who teaches at a major US university, with about 10,000 students. The campus has been opened up, with expected results: I think they’re currently running at over 150 cases, with dozens of new cases every day.In NZ, a tiny country of five million people (and a lot of sheep) we have had, in total, in our new outbreak, 78 cases at the last count, and are getting between 9 and 13 new cases a day.It is sad, but it is not “all over” with New Zealand.2020/11/02 Update.This answer is still getting reaction, so I thought I’d add a reference that a lot of people might have missed, with a little commentary.Many people regard NZ as exemplary in its handling of the pandemic, but in fact at least one country did a great deal better: Taiwan has a larger population than NZ, and has had fewer cases of Covid-19 and fewer deaths whilst its social measures have been less stringent (restrictions, but not a full lockdown—though our lockdown was never a complete curfew). The two cases have been studied, by professionals involved in advising the governments, in a very accessible paper here:I should say that this study is of the Lessons Learned kind, comparing two successful strategies; there is critique of the NZ response, but I’m still glad I’m living here rather than most other places in the world.TheBecause politics are relevant, and most Quorans are unlikely to be familiar with the ins and outs of NZ politics, here are a few notes. I have passionate responses to some of these things, but I try to stick to what most people would agree on.One of the strengths of Taiwan has been that it has strong, well prepared central government agencies. Taiwan has transitioned from an authoritarian regime with a strongman central figure, to a functioning democracy; doubtless as a legacy, it has strong central agencies. NZ in the 1980s and ’90s went through a revolutionary transition from a bureaucratic and administered democracy to full-on neoliberalism, a revolution initiated by the Labour party (think Clinton Democrats or Blairite Labour achieving everything their left opponents suspected they wanted). A consequence is that central government has been reduced to policy making, and functional entities have been decentralised, privatised, or set up on a quasi-market driven State-owned pattern. For instance, Taiwan has a central government body for epidemic control. NZ used to, but it was abolished, its functions given to a quasi-market scientific research body, and then contracted out by that body to the Ministry of Health.The Labour party has been moving back from that era, but none of them are what you’d call socialist firebrands. Further, the Government that was faced with the pandemic was not a Labour government, but a coalition of Labour with the Greens (who vary between being LEFT-green and GREEN-left, and are currently more Green than left), and a thing called New Zealand First, which is a populist party of the moderate right (moderate by US standards, anyway), which is regarded as primarily a vehicle for its leader, Winston Peters. Peters was Deputy Prime Minister, and was consistently a voice for giving strong consideration for the economic consequences of all measures; a legitimate point of view, but one that perhaps contributed to initial delay.NZ had a small provision of PPE; an underfunded public health service; a pandemic plan that was based on influenza; and a tradition of muddling through. Taiwan had had experience of non-influenza pandemics, strong central agencies, and a cultural acceptance of wearing masks (and the masks to wear). So Taiwan was ready to go with border closures and moderate-level social measures on December 31, the day WHO declared a pandemic. NZ on the other hand didn’t take any measures until February, started off on a mitigation strategy, and only belatedly went full-on. It is generally believed that the change in strategy was a personal decision by the Prime Minister; she certainly made frequent use of the argument that a strong public health response was, in the long run, the better economic response, too. This was a point she had to make repeatedly, and she seems to have been right.Edited to add:Further editTaiwan comes out better from the comparison, for sure. The government failings in NZ are for the most part not tactical issues of the response in 2020, but the results of long term deficiencies in preparation, for which I have my own somewhat partisan explanation. But it should be said that some of the advantages Taiwan has had are not under the control of any government.Taiwan has extensive economic ties with the PRC, and obvious very close cultural affinities. This means the relevant people in Taiwan were in a position to know there was something going on very early, and indeed Taiwan’s first case was straight outta Wuhan. It’s not impossible that there were people in Taipei who knew as much about what was happening in Wuhan as the authorities in Beijing, if the early cover-up was really a regional party thing. Taiwan had also had experience of SARS, and although the essence of wisdom is to learn from other people’s misfortunes, your own problems have a greater saliency.New Zealand is also unfortunately placed for economic impact. Two very big industries here are in-bound tourism, and international education at both secondary and tertiary levels (yes, education is now an industry here, see my earlier comments on the neoliberal revolution). The first thing you have to do to get control of this disease is close the borders; in NZ, do that and bang goes about 7.5% of GDP, and a larger proportion of overseas earnings, and there’s no very clear path for getting it back. AFAIK Taiwan’s foreign trade is much more in things they make (very well, actually) and that’s less affected.The war metaphor for dealing with this pandemic isn’t very good. The Prime Minister has constantly used a sporting metaphor, which is good communications to get popular cooperation, and comes naturally to her (at school she was apparently a competitive basketball player—It’s not over yet.

One such area where this digitization is mostly required is the education sector as the education industry has been working with the traditional approach for the last 40 years. And we have seen a rapid shift in the perspective of the students and parents as now they are more concerned about their child’s growth and the activities which schools are providing in order to develop the personality of the child. Hence, for schools, colleges and other institutions it is extremely important to have a school management system in place so that they can interact with the parents better. Another such aspect is the enquiries as the school's whole business is dependent on the enquiries and admissions and there comes the requirement of a school management software to automate the admission process and handle the enquiries in a better way. School management systems also help in sending communication to the parents so as to build a good relationship with them. Similarly, there are a lot of benefits a school management system can provide and it is compulsory for every school to opt for it.One such school management software I know is Skolaro which has been dominating the market for a decade now.Few of the essential features of any school management system are -Admission Management - With Skolaro admissions management and registration software both students and parents can easily apply for the school, college and university admission process. Entire flow of Admission is taken care of in this application right from beginning of filling up form to selection for Interview/ shortlisting for Examination to announcement of shortlisted students for Admission to payment of Fees for Admission.Finance Management - Skolaro finance management system enables an Institute to set-up the critical fee management functions applicable across all the departments within the Institute. The module offers flexibility to set-up fee heads and fee structures as applicable to courses across all the departments in the Institute, scholarships, fee concessions etc.Academic Management - Skolaro academic management system significantly reduces the workload and time spent by teachers on manual work. They can create question banks for various courses and upload files, documents, images and media in a variety of formats.Student assessment management system enables teachers to upload, share, track assignments and send reminders to students via online and mobile devices. Students can also make online submissions of assignments from within the system, while teachers can provide grades, and share the feedback with students and parents.With over 50+ modules Skolaro is helping schools implement processes in a better manner. It provides 100% data security. Ensure regular support is provided by the tech and account management team to make sure you are fully capable of implementing the system efficiently at your school.",69 followers,Pulkit Midha,11.8K,52,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-LPU-a-good-option-for-an-MBA

He started coming into our class more frequently, and caught us multiple times. Damn!Next day, he complained all this to our principal. And we got punished that day. While standing outside the principal room in punishment, we were planning our next blueprint to turn on the AC. (Yess, I had a evil mind. hehehe).This time we had a fool-proof idea.We used a black insulation tape.Yes, this simple looking black tape.And guess what,It wasn’t able to identify whether the AC is on or off just by looking at it.But, one thing left. With every AC, there comes a stabilizer.And yes, I did the same damn thing with the stabilizer also. I cut a perfect sized tape and pasted it in sync with the display.After doing all of this in our free period, the rest of the students were not able to guess what I did there.Even our maths teacher was confused for healthy 5–10 minutes staring at the ACs. xDThe gate keeper used to come to our class, peek through the door, checks that AC display is off.

This had started at MIT with Whirlwind ca 1950, and many important early technologies happened on this machine, including: displays, pointing devices, interactive dynamic language, core memory, etc. A lot of engineering was done on these in the SAGE development, and this helped raise all boats.The early 60s also saw a deeper effort to replace punched card accounting machines (PCAM) with computers (this led to more than 14,000 1401 computers being built — and to the way IBM thought about the eventual System 360 in 1964).JCR Licklider started the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) in 1962, and this agency plus ONR and the Air Force did the bulk of funding for visionary long range projects in computing. IPTO alone funded about 16 large research community efforts spread around the country.The first fruits of ARPA funding can be seen by getting — it’s online — the Sept 1966 special issue on “Information” by Scientific American. This special issue was completely written by the ARPA community, including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Ivan Sutherland, Dave Evans, etc. I cherish this because I first met this community in Nov 1966 as a grad student, and this was a great summary of what they had accomplished in the first 4 years.Today we have a paradox. We have enormous amounts of inexpensive computing power but very few ideas out and about: commercialism has produced a boring low-level orthodoxy and created such a monumental stultifying “normal” that I think it is much harder for youngsters to think about interesting things while being suffocated in “really nothing much at all (but no oxygen either!)”.†In the 60s, there was also a boring low-level orthodoxy — especially IBM — but because of ARPA et al. great ideas not only abounded and were being worked on, but many of the ideas were superior — in absolute, not relative, terms — to most ideas in view today. ††When Congress in 1970 made a huge error and used a too broad brush to recast ARPA, ONR, etc., they threw the baby out with the bathwater and left most of the important computing research of the country to the whims of businesses — most with IBM’s fatal disease — and government agencies — like NSF and the new DARPA — that were much too much under the thumb of Congress.In sum, computing in the 60s had a large super exciting part to it — it was a† There are a very few exceptions today to keep us from being totally gloomy, for example:†† Here are a few personal favorite highlights of advances in computing in the 1960s (many more will have to go unmentioned). Many, but not all, funded by ARPA-IPTO.1960• JCR Licklider “Man-Computer Symbiosis” which started the vision that led to ARPA-IPTO funding and much of the personal computing and networking technology of today.• Algol 60, BNF, and Ned Irons’ “Syntax directed compiling”.1961• The Burroughs B5000 (main designer Bob Barton): a two CPU “higher-level” computer with tag bits on every word, unforgeable references, protective memory management and swapping, parallel processing, and a hardware implementation of a “byte-coded” execution engine tailored for Algol-like languages. A “Simula-machine” several years before Simula, and the first system to implement an operating system completely written in a higher-level language. Can’t be too highly praised.• CTSS/MIT one of the first real interactive time-sharing systems as a “computing utility” for a whole community.• Paul Baran at RAND presents first briefing on the possibilities of packet-switching networks1962• Lisp 1.5, John McCarthy, et al. The very important follow-on from the invention of Lisp (can’t be too highly praised) in the late 50s.• JCR Licklider starts ARPA-IPTO with initial funding to MIT for “Project MAC”. Can’t be too highly praised.• “Sketchpad” by Ivan Sutherland at Lincoln Labs. Not just the invention of interactive computer graphics as we know it today, but with “masters and instances” initiated “object-oriented” representations, and used “constraint solvers” as a very high level programming language. Can’t be too highly praised.• Wes Clark’s LINC at Lincoln Labs — arguably the first personal computer that included all the standard features1963• John McCarthy — Situations, Actions, and Causal Laws — a landmark follow up to the “Advice Taker” paper “Programs With Common Sense”. I believe this is the first introduction of the idea of “labeled states” and “situations” as gatherings of “labeled states”. Can’t be too highly praised.• JOSS at RAND, Cliff Shaw. The first truly well designed interactive programming system for end-users• Thomas Evans, Geometric Analogy Solver — my vote for the top thesis from the incredible first round of “real AI” theses from Marvin Minsky’s students.1964• SRI: Engelbart and English invent “mouse” pointing device• RAND: Tom Ellis et al, invent the RAND Tablet, a truly great pointing device• Simula I converted Algol to the language that served as the model for C++ in the early 80s. A great combination of insights (implemented in 1965, and published in the US in 1966).• Meta II by Val Shorre was a wonderful tiny and powerful self-bootstrapping way to create programming languages, including itself.1965• Ivan Sutherland’s IFIPS paper inventing virtual reality and augmented reality.• Butler Lampson’s first designs and writings about systems design, protection, and inter-process communication fomented by the “Project Genie” time-sharing system (which became the SDS-940, and the computer used by Engelbart for “the mother of all demos” in 1968). Butler can’t be too highly praised.Niklaus Wirth — Euler — was a compact detailed runnable example and model of making a generalization of Algol (kind of Algol meets Lisp as motivated by van Wijngaarten). A great set of ideas to learn from, especially if his syntax apparatus was replaced by e.g. Meta-II-in-Euler. Used a small interpretive virtual byte-coded machine modeled after the earlier B5000 hardware.1966• Gab Groner’s great gesture and hand drawn character recognition system at RAND, using the RAND tablet.1967• Dave Evans, Gordon Romney, et al, with breakthrough by John Warnock, University of Utah ARPA Project — Invention of modern continuous tone 3D graphics1968• Doug Engelbart, Bill English, Jeff Rulifson et al — “the mother of all demos” showing the public an elevated rich example of many facets of “personal computing”, idea linking, collaborative simultaneous creating, etc., from a cosmic vision that has largely been lost today. The overall vision and effort can’t be too highly praised.• Ivan Sutherland, Bob Sproull, Chuck Seitz et al. — VR and AV for the first time• Tom Ellis, et al. — The GRAIL System — the first completely pen-based system, recognizing drawings and text to make hyperlinked simulations, etc. A landmark in “intimate computing” and user interface design.• Ned Irons — IMP — the first really workable and convincing most easily fully-extensible language1969• Pat Winston — Learning Structural Descriptions From Examples. This thesis was published in 1970, but the work was done in the late 60s. A truly wonderful piece of work that creates a generalized theory of analogy and representation that was motivated by the previous work of Tom Evans, but breaks new ground and extends the range of ideas into programming languages.• Carl Hewitt — PLANNER — both the spiritual and an actual parent of Prolog and many other inference systems to come that were also programming languages.• Dave Fisher — A Control Definition Language — also published in 1970 but done in the late 60s. This was a powerful comprehensive look at extensible languages — especially with regard to making mechanisms to “manipulate time” using Lisp-like kernel metaprogramming.• Nicholas Negroponte — The Architecture Machine (MIT Press) — published as a book in 1970, but work done in the 60s. By far the best account of the longer future that involved computers. Partly because Nicholas trained as an architect, and partly from his larger take on what was around him, this was the deepest synthesis and look-ahead at profound future possibilities.
