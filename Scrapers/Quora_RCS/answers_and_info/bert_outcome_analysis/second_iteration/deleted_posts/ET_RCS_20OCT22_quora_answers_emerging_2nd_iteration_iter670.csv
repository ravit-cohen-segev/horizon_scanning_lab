When all sites run https, DNS is the only unencrypted traffic. Unfortunately, there is no standard way to learn a DoH server, and not all apps will talk to DoH. Individual applications make connections to preconfigured or manually configured DoH servers, bypassing the OS Based DNS API. This bypass is controversial.DoH Pros:DoH Cons:So, DoH fixes the problem of unencrypted DNS traffic, but breaks the universalized, centralized DNS model from time immemorial.Personally, I like it. I understand the objections and the breaking of the distributed nature of DNS, but the unencrypted nature of DNS makes me itch more than worrying about the concentration of name lookup services into the hands of a small number of players.","36,273 followers",Stan Hanks,607,7.7K,65.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-or-controversy-over-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH
1,"I don’t think people mock Russian engines. To the contrary - they are in high demand. But the problem is that the US Government does not wish to risk the security implications of using a motor made by a potential enemy - so they are now banned from US Military and (I think) NASA use - and even their import has now been banned as a result of sanctions against Russia over the Crimea incident.Unfortunately, the Russian RD-180 is a “workhorse” used in the super-popular ULA Atlas-series rockets - which the US Military has been using almost entirely for a very long time.In an effort to resolve that,I don’t think people mock Russian engines.

The Soyuz capsule used a paper tape reader with the commands for re-entry punched onto paper tape.The Apollo computer was a wonder of engineering - really the start of the whole computer revolution.But the Soviet system was cheap - incredibly reliable - easy to fix with no more tools than a swiss army knife - and it worked.The Soyuz capsule remains the most flown - and demonstrably safest - human launch system in the world (although I think they did replace the paper tape!).But other stories are just nonsense. On that same mission, it was claimed that the famous “space pens” that could write upside down and in zero-g were developed “at a cost of millions” by NASA - but those clever/unsophisticed Russians just brought along a pencil.Sadly (because it’s a funny story) - it’s just not true. NASA didn’t pay a penny for the development of their pens - they were developed by Fisher - and not for space use particularly - and they bought a case of them for not much money.Similarly, the Soviets didn’t use pencils because the graphite dust they produce in zero g would be hazardous to inhale and could short out mechanical switches and such.But these kinds of stories about “clever-but-unsophisticated” Russian technology are often incorrect - and only partially justified.Sometimes “built like a tank” is a complement - other times, not so much so.If you’re buying a pickup truck for construction work - then “Built like a tank” is a strong recommendation…but I don’t think you want your sportscar to be built that way!Sheer brute-force approaches do have their value.","16,402 followers",Chris Everett,766,11K,78.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-or-controversy-over-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH

The Boeing (now ULA) Delta IV uses all American engines and so did the Titan IV before it. Like the Americans, the Japanese take great pride in building their own rocket engines and do a fine job. China is doing much the same.Elon Musk is entitled to his opinion. He is an accomplished, well educated man but not necessarily the top expert on the subject. He is or was wealthy enough to attempt to buy Russian rocket engines a few decades ago which has now become a moot point as his company, thanks to the hired experts and hard work of his employees, builds and develops their own rocket engines.Other people share his view that many Russian engines are the best in the world. Among several other experts, this view is not shared as American, European and Japanese engines have performance aspects comparable if not superior to a similar Russian or Ukrainian engine. You really need to consider that all rocket engines aren’t built for the same purpose. The Russians have never built anything to compare to the performance, reliability and ongoing legacy of SSME (RS-25D) or the RL10 upper stage. Many people today weren’t even born when those man-rated engines first flew and still fly today.Some of the shade being thrown at Russian engines is motivated by national pride. Some of it is a bit of self-loathing at the poor decision-making of the American government and corporate decision makers around the turn of fhe millenium. When the Cold War ended ten years prior, Western nations sought to acquire well-made former Soviet rocket engines at bargain basement prices rather than invest in their own engine manufacturers. This short-term thinking motivated by misguided politics and economics which has had a long lasting adverse impact on the American aerospace industry despite abundant warnings by many. Ironically, it was Elon Musk (SpaceX) and now a growing cadre of other companies that are reversing that trend by restsrting domestic design and manufacturing of rocket engines. Firefly is a notable exception.When comparing anything, you must first establish an objective basis of comparison then gather facts from reputable sources not necessarily just absorb the opinion of a celebrity. Don’t take only my word for it either.

6,"It’s super important to remember that in the main,There’s a super instructive book,Marco Fuxa’It’s super important to remember that in the main,There’s a super instructive book,Marco Fuxa’Enron’s key value creation engine was processing information - usually information that other’s hadn’t thought to correlate - and turning it into probability and forward risk profiles. Let me give you an example.In electricity generation, there are plants that are far too expensive to operate constantly - too many emissions, too inefficient, bad supply chain, whatever. However, they can put serious power onto the grid when needed, so you keep them around. These “peaker” plants are forward indicators about a lot of things. People generally know that, but no one thought to do anything about it.A group at Enron made these devices that put a long range infrared camera, a tiny computer, and a cell phone in a box with a battery. They’d then lease space in someone’s tree, and point it at a peaker plant, and calibrate it. When the plant fired, and the smokestacks got hot, the cell would call a number, and hang up. Every so often someone would come by, pay the rent, and swap the battery.Enron now had info that was super useful, in real time. No one else had it. Think that might have made a difference in how they looked at forward prices on oil, electricity, carbon offsets, you name it?? Damn right it did.That’s just the tip of the iceberg. If there was a piece of information that anyone thought might be interesting, useful, valuable, eventually someone would find a way to get it - in real time - and drop it into the forward risk calculations, and it would come out in pricing.They also did amazing things with contract novation, basically buying long-term out-of-the-money contracts from customers so that they could sell them new fancier in-the-money contracts - and then, somehow, always manage to sell the out-of-money contracts to less desirable customers with even MORE out-of-the-money contracts.Broadband was a huge arbitrage play. My goal was to create an actual forward market for bandwidth, and to allow that to development of derivatives and synthetic derivatives for managing risk. To do that, I created a naturally long position (but much, much thinner than anyone else’s network by an order of magnitude) of fiber in the ground. And I created a huge naturally short position of “science fiction” bandwidth intensive services - yes, video on demand at broadcast quality, in 1998; yes, the ability to slave two AVIDs together across the country and co-edit live broadcast video; yes, the ability to have fully live redundant data centers separated only by speed of light.The dynamic tension between the two was the wedge used to jump start the market. We had real progress being made, hundreds of millions of dollars of bandwidth buys we had ordered, hundreds of millions of sells, that we were driving through our commodity exchange.And it all blew up, because Skilling pinned the credit available to the company to the price of ENE, needed to boost the stock price to raise the ceiling, and went out with… what did the DOJ say? Materially misleading, yeah, that’s it. Materially misleading information to the market.When Blockbuster unravelled - because Blockbuster didn’t have permission from the studios to do the deal they wanted to do with us - and had to be backed out of the 10Q, the questions about that caused a lot of even shadier stuff (like the Nigerian barges Marco talked about) to show up and the whole thing exploded.But man, before the wheels started coming off the bus, it was an insanely creative place. Incredibly bright people making impossible things happen. Hey, let’s create a synthetic derivative crossing weather to carbon offsets! Or since we have that, corn! Or hey, maybe there’s a soybean/carbon offset hybrid…Crazy stuff.I learned an incredible amount there. I lived and died by the RAROC process - risk adjusted return on capital - plus actual mark-to-market which is unbelievably useful if you use it for good, not evil.From the inside, it was no surprise to keep getting “Most Innovative Company” awards.

Our radio sphere represents our “sphere of influence” in the universe. It is within this sphere that humanity’s electromagnetic radiation can be detected.At this point, you’re probably thinking that humanity has a very large “sphere of influence”. I mean, our electromagnetic radiation has been propagating outwards into space for over a hundred years at the speed of light so our radio signals must be all over the galaxy. Right?Heck, our Radio sphere could even span across multiple galaxies right?This being astronomy, I’m afraid it’s now time for a depressing revelation on how infinitesimally small our “sphere of influence” is.Spoiler alert: it doesn’t span multiple galaxies. It’s not even halfway across our own galaxy.This is how far our radio signals have propagated into our home galaxy: the milky way.The little pale blue dot in the image represents our “sphere of influence”. The dot is about 200 light years in diameter. Every radio signal ever produced by humanity (including the ones you used to send nudes to your ex) fall within the little blue dot.If there is indeed anyone outside that little blue dot, they have pretty much no way of knowing about our existence. It’s only within that little blue dot where we can be “heard” or detected.I know you're probably having an existential crisis right now and I’m sorry to add insult to injury here, but there are also over 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe and seeing our harrowing insignificance in our own home galaxy is actually quite dispiriting to humanity’s hopes of someday becoming an intergalactic civilization.So we might as well take good care of our little wet rock.
