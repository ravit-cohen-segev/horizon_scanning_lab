K. M. Birla at his office in Mumbai. The student representatives elaborated upon the fee hike problem in a short presentation and the Chancellor, while making a note of the same, discussed each and every point exhaustively. There was a lot of debate and discussion, following which, both the parties came to a final agreement. The following are the assurances from the Chancellor’s office. These points have been formally verified by the Chancellor's office.1. Student Representatives have discussed the One Batch One Fee Model with the Chancellor sir. But in order to maintain the financial health of the institution and account for the inflation, we agreed that the fees will need to be hiked for subsequent upcoming batches.In the follow-up meetings, the administration has proposed a model where the total fee for a student’s duration of study for the incoming batches would be explicitly mentioned at the time of joining. This amount will be distributed over the duration of the student’s enrolment in such a way that the fees amount will gradually increase reasonably each year but will be economically similar to OBOF Model.This has been proposed primarily because it will be much easier for the students to pay a lower amount in their first year and gradually pay the total fees after accounting for the potential increase in parental income. This will help the student plan their finances and procure loans accordingly as the total amount to be paid for their education will be already mentioned in the circular.A side benefit of the same is that this helps us in attracting students who wouldn’t have been able to pay the amount as per OBOF structure in their first year but might be able to afford it in the subsequent years, thus making sure we won’t end up compromising on quality which is the first and foremost priority of the institute.The administration is currently working on this model and will come up with the figure for the total fees to be paid by the 2019 batch for their entire duration of enrolment shortly.2. Rollback of the fee hike already announced for this year is not possible as the institute finances have already been planned accordingly. But the institute is reviewing the fee structure for the currently enrolled students and shall come up with the exact amount to be paid for the complete remaining duration of the enrolment of the current batches by the end of July.3. Honourable Chancellor Sir has assured an increase in the number of scholarships provided to students.4. The criteria for disbursement methods of Merit-Cum-Need (MCN) scholarships will be revamped to ensure that only genuine and eligible students avail. .5. Increase in the number of scholarships dispensed from the Student Aid Fund (SAF).6. Separate fund allotment to students’ technical projects and the technical teams on campus.7. Efforts to establish soft loans exclusively for students of BITS Pilani with low annual income.8. While BITS offers excellent academic curriculum and infrastructure, as part of the continuous development of the Institute, Chancellor Sir has kindly agreed to the following as well:Efforts to improve the PS-1 projects and number of stations for students during the summer of the second year.Improving the speed and bandwidth of the internet on all the three campuses.Provision of 24*7 Pharmacy and Emergency Facilities as well as upgradation to the existing medical facilities provided on campus. (Specific to Pilani Campus)Improving the functioning of the Technology Business Incubator (TBI) in all three campuses.Improvement in the Connaught Place (Specific to Hyderabad campus) will be looked into.Ensuring additional library space, possibly in NAB. (Specific to Goa campus)Trusting the chancellor and the administration to fulfil all the promises, we, the student representatives are now officially calling off the protests, which we have formally given in writing to the Chancellor.Although the entire protest and the proceedings have mostly been peaceful, there were undoubtedly a few incidents which shouldn't have happened in the first place. We accept responsibility for all of them with humility and will issue a word of thanks and an apology on behalf of all the students to our esteemed Directors and Vice Chancellor. We would also like to extend a special word of thanks to Mr Souvik Chakraborty Sir from the Chancellor’s office for establishing a direct communication channel with the student representatives.-×-×-×-×-×-This essentially means that the 15% fees hike model will be scraped and a new fee model will be established where there will be only marginal fees hikes each year which will be slightly higher than the inflation rate that year.This happend mainly because a majority of the the vision 2020 goals (i.e massive overhaul of the infrastructure and more and more better available amenities) have been achieved.Kudos to both the management and the students for coming at the middle ground and reaching a consensus which satisfies all parties.These reforms will be initiated from 2019 onwards and will usher in a new BITSian era.",568 followers,Rachit Rastogi,661,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-conclusions-were-made-at-the-meeting-regarding-fee-hike-by-Shri-Kumar-Mangalam-Birla-and-student-representatives-of-BITS-Pilani-8th-July

So I thought it’d be a good idea to post this one, the latest milestone my fellow BITSians have achieved.BITS PilaniEDIT 2 - To people testing my acumen on the topics I’ve mentioned in this answer, and are boasting off the vast stretches of knowledge they have acquired on a certain field, I congratulate you on your success and wish for your further growth.Just to make it clear, I’m not an expert in any of these, but I see people around me so obsessed with these areas of studies, that I couldn’t help but include these points in my answer. I want to let people know what a great informative community we have at BITS, and we’re willing to have more of such enthusiasts in our campus(es).Please don’t judge me as an arrogant brat, an indecent snob or other related hideous terms when I can’t respond to your queries that I have least info on.Ciao !",288 followers,Deepak Mehta,1K,3.9K,105.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-conclusions-were-made-at-the-meeting-regarding-fee-hike-by-Shri-Kumar-Mangalam-Birla-and-student-representatives-of-BITS-Pilani-8th-July

In absence of any accountability or explanation from the management, and a lack of government oversight on the institution, owing to it being a private one, it is even more crucial for BITS students and alumni likewise to take matters into their own hands.I wrote the following piece in response to the chaos abuzz at the 3 sister campuses of BITS. And I plan to mail it from my official BITS ID to as many people from the administration as possible. If you are a BITSian too, feel free to use it (the first few paras are personal experiences, but the latter part is generic and can be reused).I am a proud BITSian. I have been, from the moment I set foot into the gorgeous Goa campus, a decade plus one year ago.Everyone knows that college is a major milestone in the life of an individual. It is the place where you transition into an adult. Where you learn to truly be your own person. It’s in those 4 or 5 years that you find your true calling. For me, 2007-11 in that small, 180 acre campus was the most transformational period of my life. I made a lot of mistakes in those 48 odd months, but I am sure that I took something from each one of them. I made friends that I will cherish for the remainder of my life. The start of my first relationship coincided with the start of my first semester. Despite being an average student academically, it did help me lay the foundation for a brighter future prospect. I’d like to think that wherever I am in life right now, is in no small part due to my experiences at BITS.However, for the past few days, I have been reading about the incessant fees hike and the student protest against it. And I am not sure “pride” is what I am feeling right now. It’s a feeling somewhere between sadness and anger.In a country like India, with an immense young population, and a dire lack of a decent educational infrastructure, BITS Pilani used to be at the forefront of how to get it all right. The Birlas were pioneers in leveraging their wealth and status to open up a college of excellence. I might be wrong, but wasn’t it all started with the aim to have a “not-for-profit”, “private IIT”? Something that imbibes the best of both worlds – with the quality of students from IITs and the autonomy that government-owned institutions don’t generally have? Wasn’t it all inspired from the fabled Massachusetts Institute of Technology? Is the vision that Mr. G.D. Birla had so weak that “corporate greed” can destroy it?And yes, I did say “corporate greed”. How else can you justify a 15% YoY increase in the fees since the last 17 years? Has inflation grown at a similar rate in the same time period? Or have the placements? I mean, you can only increase the price if either the costs go up or the utility of your product. If any price hike in a free market is not backed by either of the two, you are sure to be replaced soon.If BITS has always been a “not for profit” org, it is safe to assume that it was so back in 2002 also. Then how do you justify such high and sustained increase in costs? Why isn’t there a duly audited income statement that is published annually?There are ~7000 students at any given point in time across the 3 campuses (ignoring Dubai for the sake of consistency). Considering a hypothetical scenario where the annual fee is INR 2L per student, the total receipts from tuition fees will be INR 140 Cr. Add to that another 30 Cr from the mess fees (I am assuming it is around 3000/month). That brings the total receipts to INR 170 Cr (again, assuming that there are no other sources of income for the college (a point that we will revisit soon)).Considering a 20:1 ratio of students to teachers, there should be about 350 lecturers, professors, and senior professors. If the information provided on the official website (http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/university/fad/TenuredOnCampus [ https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bits-pilani.ac.in%2Funiversity%2Ffad%2FTenuredOnCampus&h=ATO835dE2OL0SnHOwHVDfvFWiTOLXWOqyRiXtMIWDfDLc4HVG90Q-MLh3rZZ9OO1AzIvO_ySlnIIaO5QNW7QJ09Pl6rhxoCgvpBvVe74cQAWrXKT6Q ]) is to be considered, the average pay should be no more than INR 1L per month, or INR 12L per annum. This brings the remuneration to the teaching faculty to INR 42 Cr. Another liberal assumption of an equal number of support staff being paid an average of INR 6L per annum would bring the total to INR 63 Cr.Now here’s the catch. Similar figures for IIM-Ahmedabad (for the year 2015-16) are here. Not surprisingly, staff costs comprise ~50% of the total costs. That would imply that the cost of running the 3 sister BITS campuses should be in the INR 120-130 Cr ballpark annually, leaving another INR 40-50 Cr per annum....",288 followers,Deepak Mehta,788,3.9K,105.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-conclusions-were-made-at-the-meeting-regarding-fee-hike-by-Shri-Kumar-Mangalam-Birla-and-student-representatives-of-BITS-Pilani-8th-July

It took more than a week to get the authorities to agree to a open discussion.Answers to pointed questions have been vague and misleading.All of these further strengthen the troubling assumption that the administration has decided on what it has to do. And there is nothing that can stop them.Being a private university, they are out of jurisdiction of the government, at least in all matters money. In the absence of any shareholders, they have no accountability in terms of their operational efficiency and cost management. In the absence of student representation on the board, on-campus voices are seldom heard. Finally, in the absence of a unified, vocal alumni population, they are not answerable to past students either.BITS is going down a self-destructive whirlpool.They are currently at the peak where they believe that nothing can hold them back. They know that current students have no option. They know that Indian parents, till they can loan money and bleed themselves, will do so keeping their kids’ best interests at heart.What they do not realize is that it will slowly come back. It might take years, but it will happen. Better options will emerge. Quality of incoming students will decline, eventually reflecting in the quality of corporate placements. This will tarnish the brand image scaring away good professors (even considering the lucrative financials of being one). Slowly, like a negative feedback loop, what once used to be India’s best private engineering college would be another cash grab like Manipal, VIT, Symbiosis etc; barely recognizable as a mere ghost of its past.And I will be there, to painfully and reluctantly say, “I told you so.” Wake up, assholes!","2,609 followers",Nakul Agrawal,549,330,1.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-conclusions-were-made-at-the-meeting-regarding-fee-hike-by-Shri-Kumar-Mangalam-Birla-and-student-representatives-of-BITS-Pilani-8th-July

The first tests you'll give and you'll fail badly compared to your expectations. We all are the best from our schools and getting a single digit in test certainly disappoints one.Heart Break. The story of every BITSian guy. Almost every guy has a crush on campus and almost no one is able to do anything about it. You would watch her/him from a distance and keep planning how you would talk to her/him and the next moment you realize she/he has already made a boyfriend/girlfriend.
