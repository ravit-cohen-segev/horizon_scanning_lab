This merit based system stood out from from European’s nobility/clergy dominated governing system that plagued the entire middle-age Europe.

So I won’t say in general we are not a technological innovator.What is missing is the basics like material science, semi-conductors , biological, pharmaceuticals and etc. These things need long term investment , patience, room for error. Which is not so much available in China, therefore we don’t do very well in those areas. We should now start to focus on the long term instead of short term gains, simply because we can afford it. Otherwise, this is how far we can go.","14,228 followers",Saran Udayakumar,2.3K,1K,29.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-not-a-technological-innovator

When you procrastinate, you allow the best ideas to come and finally when you finish something last minute, it has a big chance to be a lot better than things that will be done quickly.I finished high school with the highest scores of the whole school, even though my IQ isn't at genius level (132) and I am the queen of procrastination. I saw other people struggling, and I didn't even have to spend any time home to do school work, I finished everything at school and never even listened in classes. It's enough for me to read something once to remember it.I am now done with school, I didn't get a high degree because I always knew that I will never use it. Now I am a successful entrepreneur and the succes in business came faster to me than I expected.I think that business is where we can have a lot of advantages. We think about every smallest detail, which is incredibly important to run a successful business. We strive to understand how everything works, what allows us to come up with great ideas that have a big chance of working in real life because we already have the wholes system in our head. We find and solve the problems faster than any other type, which is also a big advantage.The only disadvantage we actually have, is procrastinating to the point where we just don't do anything. We don't believe in ourselves. But once we do, we can be the most successful people. Just a little bit of discipline and passion, and we thrive like no one else.Any INTP reading this - please, get yourself together and become who you really want to be. Begin with action, don't wait for motivation. I see so many answers where INTPs seem to not use the power of mind that they have and its a shame. The only thing that stops you from being successful is yourself.

This is why I said they “hide in plain sight.”If you're passionate, you can put forth a more emotional exterior. Other fields require a poker face, but most of the time it's a mix.So my answer is yes, assuming you've defined wealth, power and success then I believe that INTPs are quite capable.Many tech startups are being run by INTPs by the way.

The two year analyst experience is a crucible in which strong foundational skills are forged - skills that may then be parlayed into a variety of future roles, including (popularly) private equity.The banks can do this because banking is a people-intensive business, and they have sufficient economy of scale to train a large number of analysts in a purpose-built program.…Therefore, they let the banks do it for them, and then hire analysts after 2–3 years in banking. Private equity firms are much smaller than investment banks, and their hiring needs are a fraction of those of their banking cousins. It’s simply not economical for PE firms to invest in extensive training for entry-level, untrained hires when the model of taking them from banking programs after a couple of years works pretty well.Most private equity firms that may be willing to take you in untrained are likely going to give you a lower quality experience, with less training (or none at all), and stunt your career prospects.

The chip makers and more specifically Google.Their actions against Huawei are setting off alarm bells in the entire global cell phone manufacturing industry. Most cell phone manufacturers are not US companies. The move to ban the sales of vital chips to Huawei has most likely made all cell phone manufacturers look very closely at their reliance on American chips and technology and therefore their vulnerabilities to the whims of an unpredictable character like Donald Trump. No doubt they are all looking at what steps they can take to reduce their reliance on American chips and their exposure to the whims of US presidents.Huawei is going to suffer enormous damage in the immediate and medium term, no doubt. However the company that is ultimately going to pay the biggest price is Google and it’s Android operating system. In fact I would go as far to say that this is the beginning of the end for Android and ultimately Google.You can be rest assured that right now every cell phone manufacturing companies’ top brass are having emergency meetings to discuss this earth shattering move by Google, its impact on Huawei, the cell phone industry and the impact such a move would have on their own company if the US should do the same to them. I bet they are all feeling highly uncomfortable that by the stroke of a pen, someone as impulsive, thin skinned and unpredictable as Trump can literally destroy their multi-billion dollar companies overnight. Samsung, LG, Sony and all other major cell phone manufacturing companies are most likely going to instruct their R&D departments to start working immediately on developing their own operating systems. You can be rest assured that future devices from Samsung, LG, Sony and Huawei etc will be coming out with their own operating systems. Bear in mind that virtually all cell phone companies are not American companies. Android is not going to survive this - it is going to be gone within a decade.Less or no Android phones means less revenue from Google Play store, less Gmail users etc. Google’s revenue and shares are going to tank.The same for their reliance on American chips. They are going to start making a concerted effort to wean themselves off American chips and seek alternatives. Most likely the alternatives is going to come from China, who is now going to accelerate the development and manufacture of their own such chips.I think ultimately it is going to affect more than just the cell phone and chip industry. The Trump administration’s over eagerness to use such tactics willy nilly is making companies, in all industries across the globe, look at their exposure to, and any reliance they may have on, any American equipment and technology. Steps are going to be taken to reduce that reliance and exposure. Because of these latest moves, overexposure to and reliance on American equipment and technology is henceforth going to be viewed as a major risk. Steps are going to be taken to mitigate this risk, which ultimately is going to result in less and less business for American companies.This is a massive own goal for American business.",22 followers,Joseph Wang,1.1K,28.6K,104.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-not-a-technological-innovator

There used to be a vicious cycle that stunts the growth of Chinese IC industry: bad performance -> no one uses them -> no money for R&D and no chance to test for bugs -> bad performance. So the best way to slow down the development of Chinese IC industry is actually for the US to sell as many IC chips to China as possible. This way, Chinese IC firms will be starved from the capital and talents needed to grow.With the ban on Huawei, this vicious cycle is broken. Going forward, Chinese IC industry will go through a virtuous cycle: more usage -> more money for R&D and more chance to test for bugs -> better performance -> more usage.And Chinese government will have no reservation on showering Chinese IC companies with state support, which is exactly what Trump tries to stop. Now that Trump shows that the US is happy to use governmental actions to crush commercial competitons, Chinese government will have no qualms at all in supporting Chinese IC firms with subsidies and protectionist measures.Globally, 7 out of the top 10 mobile phone makers are Chinese. And just Chinese domestic market alone is 1.4 billion strong, which is big enough for Chinese mobile phone makers to adopt Chinese ICs. After Chinese ICs become better, they will then be rolled out to other developing markets.Once the virtuous cycle starts to kick in, we will witness a meteoric rise of Chinese IC industry. It really doesn’t bode well for American IC industry.In short, if you are looking for what MYOPIC policy is like, you can’t find a better example like Trump’s ban on Huawei and other Chinese tech companies.","66,518 followers",Dima Vorobiev,633,4.2K,138.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-not-a-technological-innovator

Learn to say noLearn to say no more often to guard your time for your highest leverage activities.A saying “no” tip: When someone comes to you with a request that you need to say no to, simply ask them to give you 15 minutes to finish what you’re working on then by the time you come around to find out what they wanted, they’ll often have figured it out on their own.7. Start the day with structured ’me time’:Go through email and social media updates that have piled up overnight and triage the backlog. Knock out quick responses and referrals, so other people can start working on tasks. Schedule the bigger tasks. And delete the stuff that is informational or not important.8. Use checklists for repetitive tasks to reduce errors:Particularly when you are overworked or are operating under time constraints, checklists keep you on track.9. Eliminate personal distractions:Personal distractions could also kill your productivity at work. When you let personal distractions interfere with your work, you would easily lose focus and waste time doing nothing.10. Stand more:Are you feeling a little sleepy around 3pm? Stand up!Is your posture starting to wane? Stand up!It’s simple, but it’s effective.～Bonus tip: Find the real, motivating reason for completing the task.If you experience a slump in your usual productivity, a lack of motivation might be the culprit. Motivation is the fuel for productivity in the face of apathy, and generating it is as simple as tying the task at hand back to a bigger, more important goal.Upvote if any of these could help you.",1 follower,Alex Ferman,5.6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-not-a-technological-innovator

Many engineers propoThere is popular story on working smarter which goes something like this.A soap manufacturing company received many complaints from their retailers mentioning that some of the purchased soaps were empty. There was packaging but there was no soap inside them. Since these soaps were manufactured in lots, the issue was critical as the retailers were paying for empty boxes.This issue is harder to resolve as the whole process is automated by big machinery. The management assembled their technical team and asked to get them a best way to suggest how would they resolve the issue. Many engineers proposed different solutions. They chose the top two:Both these solutions were somehow impractical. It was not suggestive to pass each soap box through a weighing machine as it slows down the manufacturing process since each soap box has to pass through. The second solution requires constant monitoring from a representative which is not recommended.The managers now placed a hefty prize money and asked the people who were working down in the line to suggest something for the issue. One maintenance laborer went to the manager and asked some money in advance for the solution. The maintenance guy said he will return back the money if he didn’t found the solution, but if he did, the manager will require to give him two times the prize money since he is also providing the mechanism for resolving the issue. The manager agreed and provided him some money.As the days progressed, the company heard fewer complaints about the empty soap boxes. Until one day, there were no complaints from them at all. The manager remembered the guy who mentioned he will find a solution. He thought may be it was his work. He met the guy and asked whether his solution worked. He said, absolutely, and asked whether he is receiving any complaints now. The manager responded, no they aren’t. The maintenance guy mentioned he will give him the mechanism once he provides him the agreed prize money. The manager had a discussion with higher officials and gave him his prize money.The whole management was curious on what the mechanism was, whether he used sensors or some machines. The maintenance guy requested only one person to accompany with him. His manager went along. They both stopped at a place where the belt with the soap boxes goes into other machinery where it packs them into boxes.The manager didn’t see anything unusual there. The maintenance guy casually bent down and turned on a switch. A fan, which was right besides the manager, started blowing some air. When it was on full speed, it just blowed away the empty boxes which he placed them for demonstration. He turned off the fan, unplugged it and handed it to the manager while slowly walking away.The moral of this story is pretty simple. If you understand the problem at a very fundamental level, it just requires a lazy ass to resolve it. Also, common sense is the best starting step to find a resolution to a problem. We see this lacking in some people causing them to do great hardship when it can be done with simple common sense.Edit:If it is already posted on Quora or if you have already read it, please down vote the answer.

He optimized everything, checked the past 20 years of weather, made predications about expected rainfall, and planted the best possible crop for his area.The first year was normal, the guy who was planting randomly got a harvest, and the guy who optimized got a better harvest.The next year, there was a freak weather event, conditions changed, it was like nothing we saw in the last 50 years.The guy who planted randomly got his harvest.The guy who optimized got nothing.Either you leave room for errors, a margin of safety, breathing room, etc, or you have at best a one trick pony, more likely a failure waiting to happen.Whatever you are doing, you need to avoid the tunnel vision, take a step back, and look at the bigger picture.You will save yourself a lot of trouble in the long run.",0 followers,Andres Pedraza,21.4K,2.6K,2.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-uncommon-ways-to-work-smarter-instead-of-harder

This may sound like a “work harder” proclamation, but this is what I found helped kickstart the rest of my day!This is the same philosophy as “eat the frog” or “do the scariest thing first” and it has worked wonders for me.What I want you to realize about this is that it can mean anything from doing more in the day, to doing the most difficult thing first to doing everything you set out to do in the morning.There is no greater feeling than getting everything important done before noon! Think about having the rest of the day off AND already having accomplished some insanely big tasks!Motivation is an emotion you can call upon from time to time, but it generally comes and goes as it pleases. In this case motivation makes an exception and stays almost the rest of the day.Not only will you feel extremely motivated, which increases your productivity a lot, but you will also feel super confident, like you are owning the world and all other tasks will be a piece of cake.This is the reason so many successful people get up around 5 or 6 in the morning. The feeling will still be there no matter how early you get up because the world will still get the same amount done by noon regardless of how much you do.What I mean by that is this: Have you ever gone for a morning stroll before most people get to work or before some people get up? Maybe it was a very late night stroll or an early morning rise, but either way there was a calm sense of peace around, right?Compare that how it feels to go outside at noon and you will literally feel the differenc...",0 followers,Liz Huber,1.1K,123,1.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-uncommon-ways-to-work-smarter-instead-of-harder

I would advise purchasing the Asus Nighthawk X6 AC3200.Perform the hardest task of the day two to three hours after waking up: Your most precious resource isn't time. energy in the mind. The only time you have peak mental energy is between 90 and 120 minutes after you get up, and this period typically lasts between 2-3 hours. At this moment, do your most vital chores.Have Your Groceries Delivered: Going grocery shopping wastes time, takes time away from other activities, and can lead to overspending on unhealthy foods. For only a few additional bucks, use an app like Instacart to have your weekly groceries delivered right to your door.Make a Sunday/Thursday Meal Plan and Prepare the Food: Eliminating unneeded decisions is a wonderful approach to speed up the process and increase productivity. Choosing what to eat every day is one of the most wasteful choices. Every Sunday and Thursday, spend two to three hours preparing a healthy lunch. It will transform your life, I promise.Hire Someone to Clean Your Home or Apartment: Success and productivity both depend on a clean environment. Hire a house cleaner as frequently as you can afford to come if you work from home (or even if you don't). Within the first month, it will pay for itself.Exercise for 30 to 90 minutes each day: If you don't have 30 minutes to spare, you should at least exercise for 60. Seriously. Exercise is a required component of your work description, according to the Harvard Business Review on several occasions. It is necessary for mental health and top performance.Use a Dvorak keyboard and a faster mouse: You'll avoid wasting hours of time each year by using these two tricks.Use smart home automation: Purchase a Roomba and set up an Alexa (or comparable device) that enables voice control of various devices. It will help you save a tonne of time and give you Tony Stark-like confidence.Make location-specific tasks: Divide your day into several duties, such as writing, email correspondence, sales letter creation, etc. Next, choose a specific place for each task and ONLY finish that work there. This may be as easy as switching which side of the table you sit on, but it can generate strong mental connections that will speed up your productivity.Automate Your Accounts: You're doing it incorrectly if you spend more than a few hours each month reviewing your finances. Automate your money by following the I Will Teach You to Be Rich procedures, and your bills, investments, and savings will all be handled automatically.Ten minutes of meditation This technique could ""Cost"" you time, but it will pay for itself in improved mental performance and clarity, similar to how sleep and exercise do.Seriously, outsource the things you despise. Pay someone else to do something you detest doing. You'll gain time, stop a mental energy leak, and be able to concentrate on things of greater importance.Plan your week with Google Calendar: You'll be 1,000 times more productive and save hundreds of hours a year if you know EXACTLY what has to be done each day. I'm going to guarantee you'll do more than ever if you use Google Calendar to schedule your whole week.Play video games while watching TV: This is true. If you're the kind of person asking these questions on Quora, you probably don't relax and recharge your body and mind very well. Every night, allow yourself 1-2 hours of guilt-free ""fuck off"" time to do anything you want. Later in the week, you'll be more productive because it will give you more energy.for purposes of this article, further information, resources and references are available at my Quora profile.","3,321 followers",David Haldorsen,815,109,6.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-uncommon-ways-to-work-smarter-instead-of-harder

But the most depressing fact is most of them compete for 700 seats in engineering colleges.I was the lazy one in my class. In term tests I was in the bottom half (even after always copying the MCQ paper from my friend who later ranked in top 10 students). I hated engineering, so life was easy for me. Then one day -to be specific 30th April 2016- I realized that if I work like this I’m not going to be selected for any college whatsoever.For the first time I really panicked. I went straight to the book shop and bought books for inorganic chemistry(as I didn’t have notes)Then I had to solve my problem. How to do A/Ls in just 3 months. My friends who were getting As had been studying for more than 2 years. What could I possibly do? I was not going to give up, this was my only chance.So I learned how top students prepared for exams. They did 2 very important things,Well how can this help me? I have only 90 days. Surely even if I studied daily it wouldn’t be enough.So I asked a simple question.These are the answers I got.Now my task is simple. I have to find more effective and smart methods to do these 2 things.For the next 2 months I did this.So the final term test came and it sucked. My physics and mathematics marks were in mid 40s while chemistry in mid 20s. It was not surprising because I hadn’t complete the part two.Then I started doing past exam questions. I would do a problem/or usually a part of it, then look at the answer, and study the relavent section in a book.Then I would start searching for patterns in the papers of last 5 years. It was confusing at first then it all became very interesting. I found patterns everywhere from calculus to trigonometry and organic chemistry to physical chemistry.To be more specific I’ll give an example. If you rearrange a trig function in a certain way you’ll always get a similar problem in 4 of these papersWhen exam date was getting close it was so hard not to get frustrated. Luckily most of the things went allright and I obtained descent results (not great but OK for me).Note- I’m just an average student. I wanted to work hard during this 3 months but I couldn’t do that. I was a really awful procrastinator.So the bottomline isI wrote this answer just to clarify things in my mind and now I feel better.",2 followers,Richard Muller,19.4K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-uncommon-ways-to-work-smarter-instead-of-harder
