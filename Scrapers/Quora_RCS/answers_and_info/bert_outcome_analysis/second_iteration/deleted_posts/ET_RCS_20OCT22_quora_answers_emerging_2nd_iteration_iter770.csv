While the F-15 may remain in production and service the F-22 may be retired earlier. This will likely happen when the next generation of stealth fighter is in production. And it is most likely due to cost measures. It would be to expensive to upgrade the F-22. While advanced models of the F-15 are ready for production.And interestingly, as well as advanced sensors, stealth and high performance the next generation fighter will also be developed and manufactured with new technologies and methods.The new fighters will also likely have many of the revolutionary technologies of the F-35. Including advanced information management, pilot fusion, battle-space data sharing, and low emission sensors. Using F-35 derived systems could significantly reduce development costs.There are claims that one Gen 6 fighter is being tested.The new fighter will include advanced technologies used in the F-35 but will be larger and more powerful. It will have a very high power to weight ratio. The fighter will have super-cruise, able of maintaining supersonic speed. Weapons will be in bays and will have extra hard-points for fuel and weapons if needed. It will be more of a pure stealth design. It will have advanced passive sensors and high-speed data sharing. With pilot fusion. Providing pilots with superior awareness.Before WW2 the US greatly underestimated the capability of Japanese fighters. This should not happen again. Chinese and Russian technologies will improve significantly. And we may already be underestimating Chinese stealth fighters. The Chinese have already accessed considerable US stealth technology. We can not be certain how much. They likely have access to crashed an F-117, stealth drones and helicopter. And may have access to some western technologies. As well as espionage and hacking.The new fighter will have some SEAD capability. Able to match the F-35. Suppressing enemy air defenses. Possibly with specific SEAD models or modularity with SEAD systems and weapons. Advanced data sharing and management will improve SEAD capability.Stealth technology is facing increasing threats. Other technologies will be needed to support future stealth capability.The design, development and manufacturing of Gen 6 fighters will be revolutionary as well as the fighters themselves. They will continue to evolve through the production process. Some may have specific roles but experience shows that multi-role aircraft are very practical. So they may be built with multiple capabilities able to be added.The development of the new fighter will be much less challenging than the F-35. The F-35 project put many constraints on the development. Requiring a specific combination and size and components. A massive amount of work was required to fit everything inside the F-35 airframe. The next fighter will have all the F-35 technology available and no such limitation on the aircraft structure, size and weight. They will not be required to do vertical landings. Though a conventional and highly automated carrier landing capability is a possibility. They will have twin engines to provide the power needed as well as safety and vertical thrust vectoring.The future development will use rapid prototyping. And more bespoke models will be available. There will also be ongoing changes in design and production. Also molecularity will allow for easy upgrades to systems.They will also have laser or radio energy weapons built in, modular or mountable.So we may see a number of new designs and versions. Designing and testing of new prototypes will be much faster with modern technologies. And the experience of earlier US fighters and aviation research. Especially the computer technologies of the F-35. But will be larger and more powerful than the F-35 and probably two engines. The structure will look much stealthier than the F-35. With very low tail surface or no vertical stabilizers at all. Probably just 2 wings and no tail if they can get such a fuselage to work effectively. With computerized flight control aircraft could be designed in almost any shape. But they will seek to have a very sleek design. Very different to the F-35 that had many restraints on its design.They may come closer to looking like the YF-23 fighter that competed with the F-22. It was a beautiful design but may have been a bit too futuristic to the USAF. The F-22 being a much more conservative design. But still revolutionary in its achievements with stealth technology. The Gen 6 fighter is likely to look more like the YF-23 than the F-22.The most obvious structural difference is likely to be no vertical tail stabilizers or very low angle tails. Closer to being flat. This will improve stealth and efficiency. While fly by wire controls make such a fighter flyable and stable.Just as revolutionary the new aircraft will use advanced design and construction techniques that were not available for the F-22. Including more advanced materials with automated manufacturing and 3D printing. The components will be very precise and of high quality that is needed for stealth. There will be many modular, quick change components to keep them effective. Easily replaced or upgraded. With modular data systems that will be adapted for each mission. The new methods will allow for quick changes in design.Future production of fighters may be aimed at producing aircraft with short-lived lifespans. This is often needed in conflicts where numbers are more important to replace lost fighters. And instead of regular upgrades, the aircraft may be completely replaced. Reducing the need for very long wear in aircraft structures that are very expensive.Future automated factories could include frequent upgrades or modifications for different roles. One factory could produce different models. Replacement parts will also be easier to manufacture after production lines have closed.Computerized machines will be able to be programmed to make a variety of components. The factory may look less like a modern production line until you get to the final assembly. Each machine could make parts for a variety of different designs or models. Depending on what was needed at the time.The aircraft electronics may vary but be compatible with different systems. Allowing for a variety of combinations but inter operating with other systems. A bit like optimizing a custom-built pc computer to suit different roles. And having software that can work them together. And also have alternative data and control sharing units that can alternate as backup units. The controls will have 3 or more different backup systems which are needed in fly by wire aircraft. When an electronic device is damaged other computers will be able to take its place.Also each planned mission could be programmed into the fighter.It is very possible the fighters will have almost full autonomy and could fly unmanned missions if needed.As well as autonomous capability the new fighter could work as an automated wing man or lead another UAV, wingman aircraft. This can help in increasing weapons loads. And provide more protection to manned aircraft.Given the advanced electron control systems and advanced data sharing future fighters would not require much modification to work unmanned. The flight controls are already mostly computer managed. The pilot needs mainly to direct the aircraft and use the throttle. There is also the potential to do automated landings in poor weather or on to carrier decks. There are already UAVs capable of very difficult aircraft carrier landings. The most difficult and dangerous task for navy or marine pilots.Design of new fighters will use years of existing technology and research to aid in design and testing of new aircraft. The computers will run lots of testing with software rather than expensive human testing. The computers can help design complex shapes that can be produced with automated tools. This will help in reducing the weight of the aircraft. And produce complex but economic design features that may not have been possible with older production technology.Fighter production will involve more automated and multi task tools. Many able to make a number of different parts. With quick design changes possible. Also the quality of the structure will be very high with very close tolerances. And very complex and light weight structures.Modularity will be used. But large stocks of parts may not be needed. Spare parts could be built as they are needed. Mostly with automated tools. Smaller production lots would be more economical. And can include upgrades incorporating new technologies.These fighters will also be fitted with energy weapons. Electronics and lasers. Able to target and destroy enemy sensors or other targets.Pilots will have advanced helmet displays that will allow for all-round vision using cameras and other sensors. And provide audio cues for pilots. Computers will process huge amounts of information to give the pilot better awareness. Without overwhelming data for the pilot. The fighter will use high-speed communications to share data with other jets and systems. Stealth will have a priority over fast turning combat maneuvers. The fighter that sees the enemy first will have a major advantage. Fighters will work with drones that will carry extra weapons for strike missions. And the fighter pilot will be able to do the targeting.Modern fighters are increasingly controlled by computers. Especially the F-35 that manages sensor information for pilots. And fly by wire systems. The next step may be to build an unmanned version of the F-35. So much of the F-35 is controlled by computers it may be easy to convert them into unmanned aircraft. Or having some remote control from another aircraft or base. Another option will be a manned system but with a UAV option. Possibly acting as wingman for other fighters. With remote controllers and various degrees of autonomy. Carrying extra weapons, sensors and fuel. Using buddy packs they could do inflight, hose and drogue, refueling if needed.Future F-35s may have an unmanned capability. Others may be completely unmanned with a degree of remote manned control.Some manned fighters may be able to fly complete missions with minimal human input. Operators could just have the option to fire weapons. And orders to change the mission as new threats appear.Unmanned systems will still need to work with human air traffic controllers. So some human intervention will be important. And totally autonomous systems are still controversial. Especially when firing weapons. So having human operators to pull triggers will be an option.Human senses, judgment and complex decision-making can still make human pilots relevant in real-life situations.Some UAVs will act as return trip cruise missiles. Set to attack a target with suggested routes. Unmanned systems are essentially missiles that carry other missiles. Missile technologies could be used to support the development of UAVs. Such as target recognition systems. Rather than smart weapons, they will be brilliant weapons.One of the most significant advantages of UAVs is the ability to carry out very high G forces. Forces that would make a pilot unconscious with a lack of blood to the brains.Hyper-sonic systems will need highly automated systems. They are too fast for human operators to make effective decisions.High G and off-sight bore air to air weapons will be assisted with advanced pilot helmet cuing systems. Giving almost 360 degree targeting while rapidly maneuvering. The helmet supported by 360 degree cameras and sensors around the aircraft.Extremely high speed will not be a priority for most combat conditions. They may be needed in interceptor roles. A supersonic cruise capability would likely be more useful. US combat operations over the past 30 years have shown that multi-role capabilities are very useful. And especially on aircraft carriers. And older models can still be very effective in multi-role combat and ground attack. So having a built-in multi-role structure is useful. That would involve having under-wing stores capability and upgrade-able weapons systems.There is a belief that as production technology improves it will be worthwhile replacing older aircraft than doing upgrades. aircraft may have a limited lifespan design. Being easier to build at first. And greater reliability of newer airframes. But this may not be very practical in reality. Would the defense forces be happy with buying airframes with a limited lifespan or lower quality construction? Choosing between quality or numbers. Short-lived but reliable aircraft. Or longer-lasting airframes that can be upgraded and potentially some rebuild work. The US airforce is still flying many Cold War aircraft. And if you look closely at US aircraft designs many of them were first built in the 50s, 60s, and 1970s. C-130, UH-1, C-5, B-52, KC-135, U-2, CH-47. And the F-15 and F-16s first built in the 1970s. And some of these aircraft upgraded but still in production. The new P-8 is based on an old B-737 fuselage. And a new order of F-15s is likely. And including many airframes that are over 40 years old. Some over 50. Well built airframes have been very useful for the US. And they expect very high-quality aircraft. Despite have new technologies that are far from mature. Like the F-35. Pushing the limits of technology and being complex to maintain. But ultimately will probably prove to be a very reliable aircraft when the bugs are corrected.Boeing.Northrop Grumman.Boeing FA-XX.Lockheed Martin.",UNKNOWN,Tim Kerk.,1.6K,9.7K,4.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-US-design-to-replace-the-F-22-when-it-loses-its-edge-to-the-Chinese-and-Russian-competitors

But they are very clear that it will be controlled and built in Japan.I imagine that both Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as well as others, are working on a future fighter, or fighter options. Boeing is working on an autonomous stealth fighter escort to be a companion to the F-35.There is talk that the new B-21 Raider (Future Stealth Bomber) will have both remote and manned operations, but the Loyal Wingman will take all its cues from its companion fighter.Although now is a time for R&D we are a very long way from building a new fighter. Probably we won't see a new operational aircraft before 2035 or 2040. The F-22 is supposed to last into the 2040s, and the F-35 is anticipated to have a 65+ year life. A great deal depends on the advances made in both aircraft and aircraft detection technology. We never intentionally wait for the other side to build a comporable or even better fighter before we start building a better counterpart.

3,"The answer may not even be an aircraft at all, but rather the ability to network all the available systems in the Area of Operation (AO) together.Consider an experiment done by the Marines while the F-35 was undergoing it’s acceptance testing. The simulation had a Marine F-35B identify and track an incoming missile target, send the information to a nearby Naval installation simulating a warship, and cue and fire a SAM to take down the incoming missile target.In the future, air combat might involve widely distributed sensors and weapons platforms rather than air combat between singular aircraftThe answer may not even be an aircraft at all, but rather the ability to network all the available systems in the Area of Operation (AO) together.Consider an experiment done by the Marines while the F-35 was undergoing it’s acceptance testing.

Ideas like arsenal aircraft, “loyal wingman” UCAV drones and similar technologies will provide the platforms to do so.In the near future, F-35’s will lead the way for F-15X fighters carrying air to air weapons or B-52’s filled with cruise missiles and glide bombs, moving in stealthily to identify and mark the targets. Farther in the future, the F-35 itself will receive an improved engine which will increase it’s loiter time, and laser weapons, providing close in protection against enemy missiles and aircraft, while B-21’s may end up acting as arsenal aircraft for the fighter.The F-22 is already an old aircraft, which first flew in 1997 and came into service in 2005, and exists in very small numbers. Potential adversaries may seek to emulate the performance of the F-22 in their future aircraft, while facing threats from the air, sea, ground and even space from a network of American vehicles and sensors.","6,078 followers",David Tussey,2.2K,1.8K,37.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-US-design-to-replace-the-F-22-when-it-loses-its-edge-to-the-Chinese-and-Russian-competitors
4,The question is as old as the F-22 & about as relevant as the F-22 — ie it isn't relevant at all. There aren’t enough F-22s to matter and it is an old & very expensive bit of gubbery that showed the world what the US could do. The follow-on F-35 is really what the US can do & it very effectively makes keeping the F-22 more of a feel-good exercise than anything else.Russia & China are so far behind the US in this fighter game that you can forget about them building competitive fighters.

6,"At this point, there is no projection, when China, Russia, the Europeans or anyone else will be able to recover the advantage of US fighter dominance:At this point, there is no projection, when China, Russia, the Europeans or anyone else will be able to recover the advantage of US fighter dominance:You could continue this list with maybe more or less minor technologies. But reality is, that nobody invested so much R&D into weapon systems as the US did - hence the advantage cannot be disputed.However the question is, what design will the US use? There is no answer to that. Because we are looking far into the future. Russia likes to deploy its Su-57 until 2028 in rather small numbers. Even though they want to addressed their engines and avionic shortcoming until then, the resulting jet will be not on the level of the F-22 (being then a 25+ years old design) nor the F-35.The UK and rest of Europe also would like to have deployed their next generation jet (if it happens…) in mid of 2030. This is a long time ahead - and it seems not to far fetched to say, that it will be at least very difficult for them to meet the US standards of now.And projected next generation technologies could be implemented without big complications into the F-35 as well:The F-35 is already highly integrated - is totally fly (and control) by wire and has already established encrypted datalinks and a sensor suite, which would make it possible to control it remotely. In this hindsight I do lack the insight why a new airframe should be constructed.The only reasonable design would be an advanced supersonic air supremacy drone, which could be cheaper then a fighter jet (but more expensive than the suggested “loyal wingman” drone), which could be mass produced and flexible controlled by F-35’s, by a ground team as well as controlled by A.I.However the armed forces (and DARPA) definitely have to address the vulnerability of hacking of such a system. But overall this could be an objectively superior system, which could augment the US military. Especially the computer aided flight and combat / lack of physical pilot would resolve into a system which basically cannot be beaten by any existing system. Such a jet could withstand more than 15G’S (a human pilot can only take 9G (positive) over a very short period of time and 2G+ (negative).

The F-35 with all of its variants is the only fighter in the world with world leading 5th generation technology, large numbers of platforms in the thousands, and worldwide basing and support including long runways, very short runways near the battlefield, assault carriers, and CATOBAR supercarriers.There will never be more than maybe 140 combat coded F-22s, and they have serious mission availability and expense issues. The F-22s will remain stateside to help the limited number of F-15C/D/EXs help F-16s guard our strategic targets where stealth isn’t a high priority. F-22s are likely not very relevant today, and it’s very unlikely that money for the upgrades that it needs to become relevant will ever become available from the Pentagon and the US Congress. F-22s have too small of a mission set and too few numbers of platforms to justify the cost of extensive upgrades.In the first half of March 2020, the number of F-35 platforms that are operational will go over 500 with another 500 or so officially funded and on order for delivery by the end of 2022, which is much earlier than the Russians or Chinese will have a viable, 5th generation fighter in full service. The Russians don’t have 5th generation technology, and the Chinese don’t have an advanced jet engine. Neither is likely to have the Block 4 technology that is currently in the early stages of being deployed on F-35s.The F-15EX and all earlier variants may or may not be as fast or as maneuverable as an F-35A in full combat configuration; however, the F-15s aren’t much of a competitor in air superiority tests against the F-35A. We expect the F-35s of all variants to achieve something like a 10:1 kill ratio against advanced enemy fighters, while any variant of the F-15 will be lucky to maintain a 1:1 kill ratio against Russian SU-57s or SU-35s. F-15E/EXs will be great bomb trucks when protected and directed by F-35s and their technology. All of the talk about the new F-15EX is a bone thrown to Boeing. The F-15EX will replace F-15C/Ds in very low numbers and without 5th generation capabilities.The other fighters that are being left out of the US conversation are the 1500 F-16s and F-18E/F/Gs that are carrying the load today. These two fighters are very potent when used in combination with F-35s. These two fighters along with the newer variants of the F-15 should always be deployed with the F-35s to do ID passes, where we want the F-35s to remain completely stealthy, and as bomb/missile trucks to add additional ordinance to the F-35’s weapons load. Wars that don’t have an air superiority issue, like in Afghanistan, can be fought more economically with these 4th generation fighters.",4 followers,Jim Danhakl,1.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-US-design-to-replace-the-F-22-when-it-loses-its-edge-to-the-Chinese-and-Russian-competitors

Many other countries were severely critical against India and many of them also put sanction (Japan, Germany, Sweden, Denmark etc.) [although Russia, UK, France didn’t].The Tejas program was affected by it because technological access was denied.But that couldn’t stop the program. The sanction ended in September 2001The Tejas program helped to create a domestic aerospace ecosystem, more so after the sanction. A lot of standard test facilities such as the LCA mini bird & iron Bird for flight control system Integration, a dynamic avionics integration rig, brake dynamometer & drop test rigs, secondary power system & fuel system test rigs, engine test bed, mobile electromagnetic interference/compatibility test facility etc. had been set up in India from scratch by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA).Then vs Now:The LCA program in 90’s was like a poor child with a poor dad having very low financial capability, establishment, respect and help in the society.GDP (nominal) of India-GDP (Nominal) of India-Tejas current status:The developmental phase is the hardest for any R&D program.

Now Tejas squadron is operational in the air force and battle-ready.“No. 45 squadron operationization ceremony at Sulur AirbaseIndigenous components:Tejas was 75.5% indigenous by number of components in 2016 already and process were on for increasing this number. Out of total 344 LRU (Line Replaceable Unit), 210 were indigenous and 42 among the rest 134 were under indigenisation process.Major imported components:Engine- GE-404-IN20 (USA).Engine- American engine will not receive spares in case of an American sanction. This is the biggest problem Tejas squadron will face in case of an American sanction. But it cannot make the fleet grounded for ever in a theoretical scenario because India is already in advanced stage of Kaveri engine development with the help of France. France is not going to put sanction on India because it’s one of the most time-tested friend and didn’t do so even in 1998.GE-404GTRE GTX-35VS KaveriThe annual report from DRDO informed that Five Kaveri engine prototypes K5, K6, K7, K8, and K9 were tested for about 145 hours in total in 2017 during which some critical and several tests like a transient test from idle to max reheat conditions were carried outRadar- Tejas’ multi-mode radar (MMR) has an indigenous antenna and scanner but an Elta EL/M-2032 processing back end.EL/M-2032Along with that, indigenous Uttam radar is in advanced stage of development.Uttam AESANose cone, aerial re-fueling probe and ejection seat-So overall, an USA sanction on India (which is more harmful to themselves so unlikely) should not be able ground India’s Tejas fleet for long.

While I agree with many of the answers listed here including language, democracy, civilization/agriculture, I echoThere are reasons not to like the moon landing. Much of the competition that drove this singular goal forward grew out of hatred and fear, namely the race between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. But at the same time, people came together in America as they never have before (in peacetime), accepted their small task as part of the whole concept, and applied themselves to achieving the goal in a very short time. Recall that between the first manned suborbital flight (May 1961) and the Apollo 11 landing (July 1969) just over eight years had passed. Think of what has been accomplished in science and engineering over the past eight years. This achievement was, by all accounts, incredible, and points to our ability, while working collaboratively with well-defined milestones, to accomplish most anything in addressing very challenging problems in our modern world.Unlike the era of 1969, we have the opportunity to look beyond competition between superpowers and fears of nuclear armageddon toward a more collaborative effort where all nations and people diverse will participate. We will be all the more stronger and immeasurably more able to face daunting challenges, together. I believe the sentiment was best summarized by the plaque left on the descent stage of the Eagle lander by the crew of Apollo 11:""Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.""Neither flag nor national symbol nor political statement of a single nation appeared on the plaque, only an assurance that the mission was conducted without hostile intention in the hope of fostering world peace through the exploration of space. Although the American flag was planted nearby to honor the country and people most responsible for the success of the mission, I do not believe it was a nationalistic statement. I have little doubt that had the Soviet Union landed first, a similar appeal for peace would have been made on their plaque.I believe we will have many more 'greatest achievements', but they will no longer come from one national identity or one group of people. They will come from many nations and many peoples working together to achieve their goals, one at a time, for the benefit of everyone inhabiting the only home we've ever known (so far), a pale blue marble in a vast ocean of emptiness. The only thing that separates us from the void is acceptance that we're all in this together, and we have the power to choose whether we pursue the highest ideals of mankind or acquiesce and fall forgotten into the countless eons of eternity.","47,946 followers",Jedidiah Benhur Margoschis Wisely,4.3K,168,18.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-US-design-to-replace-the-F-22-when-it-loses-its-edge-to-the-Chinese-and-Russian-competitors
