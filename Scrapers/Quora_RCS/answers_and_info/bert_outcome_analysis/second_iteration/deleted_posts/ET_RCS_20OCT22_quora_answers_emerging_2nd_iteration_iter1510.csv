An additional language means a foreign language, and Spanish is one of them because Spanish is the widely spoken language in India.Career Options after SpanishOnce a person has learned Spanish or has become proficient in it, the option for careers widens up. Since there are companies in the corporate world who set their criteria for the hiring of candidates who knows Spanish. This is because, knowing Spanish becomes important while dealing or communicating with a client who speaks and understands only Spanish, and secondly, it makes the client feel comfortable in communicating in their native language.ExposureAs mentioned above, people who speak only in Spanish feel comfortable communicating with those who know Spanish and understand the same. It gives them a familiar environment and it is also beneficial for the person who knows Spanish. It is beneficial for them because they get exposure to new people, and new surroundings; they get to learn more about everything related to the Spain and Spanish language.Career Options abroadWhen a student is desiring to study abroad in a country which is Spanish Speaking country, prior knowledge of the language is helpful.
