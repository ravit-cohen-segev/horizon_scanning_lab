The average doctor in the US graduates with a student loan debt of $250,000. Some US grads have family money and graduate with no debt. Others graduate with both undergraduate and medical school debt of $400,000.Then doctors have to get post graduate training in order to practice. This includes 3–8 years of residency depending on specialty and 2–3 years of subspecialty fellowship. As one of the more extreme examples of this, I work with a neurosurgeon who after completing her 7 years of neurosurgery residency, she then did a 2 year specialty in spine and then a 2 year specialty in pediatrics. I didn’t ask but I’m assuming that she is starting her career in her very late 30’s, assuming that she didn’t have any gap years to burnish her resume.Medical innovation and the public demand for it is swallowing a large amount of healthcare dollars. PET and MRI scans, Da Vinci robotic surgery machines, tomotherapy radiation units to give stereotactic radiosurgery, and immunotherapy for various cancers are incredibly expensive. For example treating a single patient with CAR-T immunotherapy costs on average $1,000,000.The practice of defensive medicine due to the absence of tort reform in the US also accounts for tremendous cost. Every patient coming into a US emergency from with abdominal pain gets a CT scan, every headache gets a CT or MRI. It adds up.If you cut physician salaries in the US by 20%, you reduce US healthcare costs by 2%.Several years ago, Princeton Professor Uwe Reinhardt (who sadly passed away several weeks ago) wrote an article for the New York Times on the subject of rising health care costs in America. He was surprised when several readers criticized him for not even mentioning physician incomes as one of the salient factors. Reinhardt, also an economist who earned his health care bona fides long ago, responded to the critics with an extensive letter to the editor. HisThe total amount Americans pay their physicians, as Reinhardt reminds us, represents only about 20 percent of total national health spending. Of this total, close to half (editor’s note: higher now), is absorbed by physician practice expenses, including “malpractice premiums, but excluding the amortization of college and medical school debt. These debt figures become all that more important when one considers that in many countries – but not in the U.S. – medical education is free. And consider,” he adds, “that doctors in the U.S. train longer as well with four years of college, four years of medical school, three to seven years spent in residencies and even followed by an additional three years in fellowships.” Even if all physicians took a pay cut of 20 percent, the savings would amount to a minuscule two percent of our health bill. Mr. Baker and other critics are clearly barking up the wrong tree. Reinhardt finished his letter by saying that “such a policy (20 percent cut) would leave an understandably wholly demoralized medical profession to which we so often look to save our lives.”There are also several other relevant issues to consider as well.

3,"This article in Forbes magazine is a good answer to your question. But to sum it up for you, no. Healthcare would not be cheaper if you paid doctors less.Debunking Myths: Physicians' Incomes Are Too High and They Are the Cause of Rising Health Care CostsThe cost of the U.S. healthcare system in 2017 was $3.65 trillion. If you broke that up to every U.S. citizen (including children under 18), we all owe $11,121. That is just for 2017. You owe this money EVERY year.Annual aggregate physician salaries accountThis article in Forbes magazine is a good answer to your question. But to sum it up for you, no. Healthcare would not be cheaper if you paid doctors less.Debunking Myths: Physicians' Incomes Are Too High and They Are the Cause of Rising Health Care CostsThe cost of the U.S. healthcare system in 2017 was $3.65 trillion. If you broke that up to every U.S. citizen (including children under 18), we all owe $11,121. That is just for 2017. You owe this money EVERY year.Annual aggregate physician salaries account for only a total of 8.6% of total healthcare spending. That means for every $100 in healthcare spending in the US, your physician got less than $9. The total cost of all medical providers (MD/DO, PA, NP) in the US amounts to $100 billion; if you do the math, that means about $956 of the $11,121 you as a U.S. citizen owe each year in healthcare costs each year goes to medical provider salaries. So If every medical provider in America worked for free, you still are responsible for $10,165 per year in distributed healthcare dollars.Physician Compensation Eight Percent of Healthcare Costs - Jackson HealthcareIf all doctors only makes 8.6% of the money of healthcare dollars, where does the other 91.4% go? Nursing homes, home health care, hospital services, prescription drugs, medical equipment, among other things. In particular, the cost of hospital services and prescription drugs. Both of these expenses have actually increased while cost of physician services have actually decreased compared to inflation.Analysis of health care spending: Where do the dollars go?Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare systems are no longer physician owned. Now they are owned and managed by non-medical CEOs. Trust-fund babies and venture capitalists buy hospital systems and then hire a huge number of administrators and paper pushers. Since the 1990s, the percentage of healthcare providers and staff (PA/MD/nurse/etc) has gone up about 150%. The amount of administrators and other non-medical clerical staff has gone up over 3200%.The ratio of doctors to other healthcare workers is now 1:16, up from 1:14 two decades ago. Of those 16 workers for every doctor, only six are involved in caring for patients—nurses and home health aids, for example. The other 10 are in purely administrative roles.https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/332372-administrative-job-growth-in-healthcare-isnt-good-for-americaAnd this growth is not driven by an increase in patient demand. This bureaucratic bloat means that there are A LOT of people taking their unearned share from the revenue generated by those who actually provide healthcare. Remember, the only money made in healthcare is from the work done by healthcare staff either directly or under the order of a medical care provider (MD/DO, PA, NP, etc). The cost of non-healthcare related paperwork and administrative salaries in the U.S. healthcare system is about $1.1 trillion.Excess Administrative Costs Burden the U.S. Health Care System - Center for American ProgressSo if you do the math again, of the $11,121 you owe every year to the U.S. healthcare system, $3,351.53 of that money goes to pay for non-healthcare related salaries (remember you only pay $956 to medical providers). So you pay WAY more money to some guy in a suit than to someone in a white coat.As an example, the the CEO of the last hospital system I worked at makes over $11,562,939.And most of the non-medical executive positions (and their administrative assistants and assistant to the administrative assistant and their secretarial staff, etc) literally have nothing to do with healthcare. I’m fact, according to the analysis by the anthropologist David Graeber and his study on modern society and meaningless jobs (later published in the book “Bullshit Jobs”), about 65% of jobs in the U.S. healthcare industry are mostly useless, if not entirely unnecessary. 100% of the “bullshit jobs” in healthcare were entirely administrative. No job involved in direct patient care was considered unnecessary.Bullshit Jobs - WikipediaSo no, any economist who knew anything about the healthcare industry would be able to look at where the waste is and see that none of it is going to waste on physician reimbursement. Physicians are reimbursed the right amount. If you want to pay them less, then you have to forgive and/or pay back their student loans among other things. But trying to make a cheaper U.S. healthcare system by paying physicians less is penny wise but pound (or dollar since we have been talking about the US) foolish.",0 followers,Bruce Epstein,899,3K,13.1M,https://www.quora.com/Would-healthcare-be-cheaper-if-doctors-weren-t-paid-as-much

These days, it's much easier to figure out who is in which companies and get quality deal flow by using AngelList and Syndicates.Early in my investing career, I was fortunate enough to co-invest with Ron Conway/SV Angel and also Josh Kopelman/First Round Capital, as well as with other early PayPal and Facebook folks. Later, I was working for Founders Fund and co-investing with Mitch Kapor. Needless to say, these were top investors, and I was lucky to get into deals with them. But surprisingly it's not that hard to do even for unknown and less rich people.I didn't understand legal structures or valuation well at the time and I was such a small investor that I couldn't negotiate much. But because I was in deals led by knowledgeable and frequent investors, I didn't get screwed with very much.2) Invest small $ in many deals (>20 minimum, ideally ~50-100+).The best way to have a shot at making money is to diversify across a lot of deals. Even for the best investors, it's probably unlikely more than 20-30% of their investments return >1X, and in fact probably <10% return >3-5X or more. Typically in 50% or more deals, you will lose ALL of your money. In other words, returns are *highly* asymmetric, and big wins are very infrequent.In order to maximize the chance of participating in big wins, most people think doing lots of upfront due diligence and evaluation will help them get better returns. I think this is a fallacy, and the ability to detect ""greatness"" early in either founders or companies is extremely challenging.The solution to this is simply to try and get access to high-quality deal flow (see #1; invest alongside experienced folks), diversify into as many deals as possible, and at least aim for a portfolio size of 20+. In my own experience, I was able to pick winners 1 out of 3 times, and big winners (10X+) 1 out of 5-10 times. In my personal angel portfolio of ~15 companies, I was fortunate to participate in early investment rounds forIn addition to providing diversification, investing in lots of companies also is a free marketing campaign: It tells people that you are an active participant in the market, which in turn will increase access to deals and to other experienced investors. Most folks don't understand this and the benefits of a large portfolio are not obvious at first. However, there are clearly network effects that build after you have established a minimum critical mass of investments (say, 7-10 or more) and have co-invested with other knowledgeable people. It’s unclear whether I have gotten any better at selection after investing for more than 10 years. However, over time, larger portfolio size has probably improved my access to deals and returns quite substantially.Lastly, people tend to remember your winners and forget about your losers. This very human psychological factor also benefits a larger portfolio size; ""even a broken clock is right twice a day"", ""even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then"".  ;)3) Develop an area of focus or expertise, and build your brand and network around this.In my case, because I had both engineering and marketing background, and because I had worked at PayPal doing developer community work and e-commerce education, I got access to a lot of financial services startups (like4) Develop a bias towards lower-valuation deals, or higher-valuation deals with other proven metrics and investors.While it's true that some of the very best deals may be priced substantially higher than average, it's also true that some of my best investments were not particularly expensive when I invested. Mashery, SlideShare, Twilio, SendGrid, Lyft, Bitly, TaskRabbit were all done at valuations of between $1M-$3.5M. There were also deals that I passed on due to price, which was clearly a major fuckup on my part, as I should have done them. Most regrettably, I passed on Uber at $10-12M valuation I think, when Travis asked me. Although he wasn't running the company at the time, I still should have invested... Sigh.While it's difficult to figure out when price matters and when it doesn't, my experience has led to my being biased towards less expensive deals on average. Occasionally, I let myself ""binge"" on a few exceptions here and there, when I feel the company has potential and has already proven some specific KPIs. That said, I am as likely as anyone else to get ""FOMO"" (fear of missing out), and can occasionally be enticed into an expensive deal if I see other smart people already investing (""social proof""). While I try to avoid this, it's not always a bad thing, and at the very least having a group of other notable investors along for the ride can help avoid some (but not all) future challenges.Still, I stand by my assertion that a large portfolio of inexpensive deals will likely perform better than a concentrated portfolio of ""high-quality"" deals at higher average price. Then again, other investors may prove me wrong.5) Double-down on winners/traction, but ONLY if you can [afford to] double ownership and there's a reasonable chance for an exit.This last point probably doesn't matter as much as the earlier ones, however it has become clear that when I was able to follow-on at reasonable prices, and increase ownership substantially, this was a winning strategy. However, I also worry that the desire to ""double-down on winners"" may have also caused me to deploy more capital than necessary, and in a constrained capital situation (which most of us live in), it may be more prudent to conserve cash for more new investments, rather than deploying capital into companies where I already owned a substantial position at a lower valuation.Some folks like Peter Thiel (my twice former employer, co-founder/CEO of PayPal, early investor in Facebook, and a pretty smart guy) talk about ""power law investing"" and advocate writing a check as long as the deal is led by an institutional investor (aka a reputable VC). While I don't disagree with Peter that this is a reasonable strategy, not all of us have as much money to invest as he does. In a budget scenario where you have access to a finite amount of capital, you will have trade off decisions to make about whether to follow-on in your winners vs. investing in more new deals.Since many of your ""winners"" may not actually be a lock in for an exit, note that you may double down on a company with improved KPIs and traction, but still with <50% chance of an exit, and perhaps <20% chance of a big win... This raises the bar for when to double down.My personal philosophy is that if we can double ownership for <3-5X of the previous valuation where we invested AND we feel the company has proven some level of ""product-market fit"" and a scalable path to customer acquisition AND there is an adequate amount of growth or revenue AND the company hasn't raised so much capital that it can't be sold for more than the last round valuation AND there is a logical path to an exit/acquirer AND we aren't capital-constrained at the time of the investment, THEN yes, we will double down. As you can tell, there are probably more reasons to NOT follow-on to an existing investment than to double down, so ask yourself a LOT of questions before you commit to your ""winners"".6) Continue to re-evaluate your strategies based on current market conditions and structural changes to environment.While I don't believe I have changed my investment philosophy much in the past ten years, I still have a healthy amount of doubt about any and all of my strategies, and continue to examine whether market conditions or structural changes to the environment may invalidate my prior logic or expectations. In other words: I still don't know shit and I'm scared as hell I'm going to lose my shirt any minute now.But in the meantime...

First, they can find a company because the founder walked into their office with a business plan or cold-called them and told them they have a great idea. Second, they can be introduced to the company by another investor, professional networker, or referral source (lawyer, accountant, etc.). The third is attending an event like AngelConf, where hundreds of potential investment candidates are gathered in one place. The fourth way is that the angel keeps their ear to the ground for interesting developments in particular sectors or regions.Some investors don't have a formal process for identifying deal flow, and others do. I believe that active investor should keep their ear to the ground for interesting developments by following the news in their sector, checking out trends on sites like AngelList, being aware of what is going on locally, and networking with people in the sector. In my experience, the number of opportunities that come from those sources is greater than those that come through formal processes.The community aspect of angel investing has served me well in this regard. There are a number of informal groups in New York where angels meet monthly to discuss business issues and hear pitches. The annual AngelConf event here draws angels from across the country. I'm an organizer for these events and have also spoken at a few other conferences as well as local meetups like Startup Weekends, which bring together students who want to start companies with investors looking for deals. All of these avenues serve to get you connected with people who can point you towards good investments and help make introductions when appropriate.How do angels find great investments?The best investment opportunities are ones that present a large market opportunity. If there is only $10 million of potential revenue, it's not worth the time and trouble to invest in growing a company. You want to look for companies that can grow into multi-billion dollar businesses like Google (which was initially just an algorithm search engine called BackRub) or Facebook (started as a social network for Harvard students). There is no single ""right answer"" about how big the market should be, but the bigger it is, the more compelling an investment opportunity becomes.Another key criterion in my opinion is whether you believe that something has changed so that this startup can succeed where others have failed. The most successful startups will solve problems that have existed for a long time. Identifying whether this is the case requires having domain expertise in the industry and more than a cursory knowledge of that sector's history.Investors who meet these criteria are well-positioned to invest in companies with high growth potential, whereas those without them will flounder because they spend their time chasing after what some might call ""unicorns,"" but others would call terrible investments.How do angel groups build deal flow?In my experience, an active angel group can generate multiple opportunities each month by putting in some time to promote themselves as well as being intentional about how they react when someone approaches them about an investment opportunity or through their informal networks. When I was going out raising money for my first fund, I spoke with other angels and tried to understand what they were looking for. In my case, I felt that most of the angels in New York City had similar deal criteria, so I decided to use the time instead of flying across the country to meet every angel. This time limitation turned out to be beneficial as it forced me to analyze what aspects of a business would make an investment interesting for our group.The best opportunities will come from identifying trends and by soliciting introductions even if you don't have any spare capital available at the moment.As an angel, how should I approach a company that I'm interested in?Before you contact the founder, you might want to analyze the pitch deck or websites of competitors. Don't be afraid to share what your thoughts are with other angels. In fact, one reason why many angels have moved away from using email as their primary communication vehicle is that it's too easy for someone else (who doesn't know the context) to get access and forward the information without permission.",UNKNOWN,David S.

Her English was even poorer than my junior high students who have never been abroad before, since she spent most of the time dating her Chinese bf whose family owns certain business in the China town. So, she ended up going to the community college after several years in the US.There are private high schools that I wanted to send some local kids to, so I asked my agent friend about their criteria, who told me that the chance we can send a kid to the top American private school is close to 0, since you can’t be both rich and qualified. (Many rich kids in our region are super lazy and cannot acquire 98 in TOEFL, let alone a high score in SSAT).I once had a student whose TOEFL is 79(I spent only 15 days to tutor her before she attended the TOEFL exam and she had stayed in the high school for only 3 months). This girl has travelled to 40 countries, published a book, set up a fund to help the Tibetan kids and she was on the waiting list of a famous American private high school. Her mom(a local high official of the party) was so desperate that she decided to give up in the end.So, we can send the Chinese kids to the summer class in Concord Academy, but the odds against being admitted by such private school is rather high. My friends won’t even try to do this.In this case, when we talk about education in a country, we have to categorize the samples and analyse different situations there.My bestie in the college used to tell me how her deskmate would swallow the contraceptive pills while having the class, after which she’d change her outfit and go to the night club and do something like the “after-prom”.But this can never happen in my high school, where most of the kids are selected by the academic performance (the best in the city with 3 million population), so we were too occupied to date anyone, let alone doing something eles. I’ve gotta work on my assignment till 2 am and get up at 6, how can I have the mood to think about developing a relationship with the opposite sex.So, even in China, there’s a huge gap between the top high schools and the average ones. The high schools in China are usually classified as: the average ones, the municipal key schools(市级重点）, the provincial key schools(省重点）and the national key schools (国家级重点）.The best students and resources will cluster in the last category: the national key schools. What’s ridiculous is that Chinese will automatically pay their respect to you when they know that you are from such schools. When there’s only one national key school in a city governing several counties and smaller cities like mine, you’d imagine what kind of competition we had. The students are thought to become the future elites of this country.So, I don’t think Americans should be ashamed of anything. They have renowned high schools like Phillips Academy. You and I need to pay a visit to such schools before making any hasty judgement.","10,663 followers",Katyayani Misra,6.4K,1.4K,42.3M,https://www.quora.com/Would-healthcare-be-cheaper-if-doctors-weren-t-paid-as-much

And the few problems that do exist will not be going away anytime soon, as it is terribly hard to cause a big change in a deep-seated culture like the American high school.","105,634 followers",Dave Consiglio,11.8K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Would-healthcare-be-cheaper-if-doctors-weren-t-paid-as-much
15,"This question obviously comes from an East Asian, most likely Chinese. American culture is somewhat anti-intellectual. There are historical reasons for this. You cannot use Chinese culture to judge American culture as it is the product of very different social conditions. And this also applies to Chinese culture.

And yet we have it.

Our society isn’t a great one in the education department.If we wanted better education, we could surely have it. It’s commonly known that summer vacation is not good for learning. And yet we have it. Sitting for long periods of time is not ideal for many students. And yet we do it. The structure of elementary schools does terrible things to many boys. And yet we keep it. The structure of middle and high schools does terrible things to many girls. And yet we promote it.Our schools are so riddled with inefficiencies and shortcomings that I could write a thousand answers on the topic. But, I can sum them all up into one basic idea:We don’t care about education.If we did, schools would get amazing equipment and top-notch resources. But today, teachers in my building were told we use too much paper.If we did, academic superstars would have a special day where they were lauded by their fellow classmates. But last week, students in my building were pulled out of class to witness signing day, a day where future athletes are lauded by their fellow classmates.If we did, experimentation would lead to techniques that were recognized and used across the profession. But today, in classrooms across the country, teachers were forced to wing it because they had no idea what to do to help their students after years of failed attempts.If we did, parents would call teachers, curiously inquiring about the well-being of their children, and helping design a way forward for them. But instead, I can’t reach half my parents no matter how hard I try.If we did, states would spend billions of dollars renovating and upgrading facilities. But states spend billions of dollars on new sports stadiums instead.There was a time when almost no one in this country graduated from high school. Then, around 1910, we decided as a nation that education was the future. We put our money where our mouth was and built great schools across the country. And we told students, “This is the future. Your mind is your greatest asset. Let’s build it up.”High school has barely changed in the ensuing 100 years, while the world outside has mo...","3,739 followers",Dani Maydan,908,437,2.8M,https://www.quora.com/Would-healthcare-be-cheaper-if-doctors-weren-t-paid-as-much

Yes, you have the friendless and the high school royalty (Varsity Basketball), but it’s not uncommon for people to speak to each other outside cliques— be it simple small talk, or deep conversations. Think of it as separate social groups, but not a hierarchy.I regret the fact that there is a good amount of people in American high schools who act like complete imbeciles and don’t care for their future, but that’s just what happens here. While people blast trap music from cheap bluetooth speakers after school ends for the day here, high schoolers in Japan—or any other country with respectable students, for the most part—probably walk through their hallways calmly and continue with their lives pleasantly.Again, I don’t know what exactly the situation is in Japan concerning high schools (I base my perception of Japanese high schools off of JRPG’s, lol), but I’d say Americans need to get their act together.

Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?II got an admit from the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad for their PGP Class of 2020.Many people have asked me why MBA right now? You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?I have got a lot of accusations, of being money minded, this and that in the PMs in Quora.This is an answer to everyone, an answer which would describe my thought process in taking this particular decision.Before, starting with that, let us understand the structure of the Government’s Bureaucracy. That will help us have more clarity, in understanding my decision.The Government is divided into Levels, according to the 7th Central Pay Commission. There are totally 18 levels, with 03 entry points.Level 01 - 05 - Lower Services - Peons, Constables, Stenos, Clerks etc.Level 06 - 09 - Middle Services - Inspectors, Section Officers, DSPs, Block Officers etc.Level 10 - 18 - Upper Services - IAS, IPS, IRS, Undersecretary etc.Now, I have always aspired for the upper civil services, usually conducted by the UPSC, which deals with the upper management of the Government.This is where most of the “thinking” is done, this is where policies are “ideated” and this is where public policies are “drafted”.An IAS joins at Level 09 during training, and then starts off from Level 10, and has the possibility of having more than 07 promotions in his career of 35 years.This is where I wanted to be, join the bureaucracy, and then rise high enough to shape the policy-making. (Usually around Level 13 or so)Now, I have been working with the MHA for the last two years, at Level 07.This is the middle management services.This is where the policies which are “drafted” by the top echelons are “implemented” on-ground.Working in rural Bihar for the last 02 years, I have understood the exact ground realities, of where exactly it is going wrong, and how the policy drafting needs a bit change, by someone who has actual on-ground realistic experiences.But, a Level 07 employee can grow upto max of Level 10 or 11, where you start competing with junior IAS officers when you are about to retire. (Example Promoted SP vs IPS SP)So, in a span of 35 years, I will get only 3–5 promotions, and that too will be still stuck in middle management, and never reach the “ideation” and “policy-drafting” stages.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” now? Which is where I really want to be.I am not able to clear the UPSC exam. I have tried.I am stuck in middle management, away from home, with an unstable life, mediocre salary, erratic transfers and postings, very few promotions and very slow career growth and strained personal relationships.If I get married to anyone soon, she would want to work in a city, which would again increase long distance and put more strain on the family.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” considering all these factors?The answer came here - Lateral Entry from the Corporate - Lateral entry: Over 6,000 private sector specialists apply for 10 joint secretary posts in government [ https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lateral-entry-over-6000-private-sector-specialists-apply-for-10-joint-secretary-posts-in-government/articleshow/65459546.cms ]And this privatization of the Government by bringing in external specialists is going to increase a lot in the next two decades or so.And they are getting Joint Secretary posts directly, which is a Level 15 post. A direct jump from Level 07 to Level 15, and if I stay I would retire by Level 10.I had to think.I had a plan.A long-term plan, with lots of risks and possibilities of failing.Get into the corporate sector.The lateral entry needs 15 years of total work-ex. I already have 05 years work-ex (Startup, Sabre and MHA)I need to work for 10 years, a decade in the corporate sector, after which I can make a shift to upper civil services - Level 15 in a very short time.And I have seen the 6000 applicants - Some are good, some are okay, not that stellar - I know my work ex in the Central Government in rural Bihar would stand out and would get a chance to interview for the Joint Secretary posts - This is 10 years later I am talking about - 2030 - When I am around 38 years old.So, how do I jump into the corporate sector?Some private job which deals with Public Policy or Development Consultancy or Social Impact or Public Administration jobs ?Also, I need a post-graduation, ensuring all the educational qualifications are in place.So, I made a list of colleges/schools/institutes which would ...","62,821 followers",Akand Sitra,2.9K,371,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/Would-healthcare-be-cheaper-if-doctors-weren-t-paid-as-much

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but I also enjoy the finer things in life and I don’t like to rely on anyone else to get them.I punted. I applied to graduate school and thought about eventually getting a PhD in Art History. I had a 4.0 college GPA, two internships at highly venerated Los Angeles museums, great recommendations from my professors, as well as a published thesis paper. I was certain one of the master’s programs I applied to would accept me. Six grad school applications, several essays, a GRE and lots of waiting led me to being repeatedly rejected by EVERY. SINGLE. PROGRAM. with the exception of McGill university in Montreal who put me on a waiting list.FUCK.Who am I if I’m not some member of the academia, the girl who has bookshelves stacked with memoirs by Caillebotte and Cassat. Who am I if I can’t speak with authority while I tour Europe casually with friends:Internal monologue ensues:Enter, University of Portland Pamplin School of Business.I spoke to their program advisor, did some research, looked into Portland, applied to the school, got accepted because of my GRE score and gpa but needed to work on a lot of prerequisites in the summer term to catch up. I found an apartment, moved, bada bing bada boom.Two years later I became an associate at a top financial advisory firm. Now I’m a portfolio manager. If I went with getting a PhD in art history I would still be in school with no promise of employment after I graduate. I work 8–5 M-F and have full benefits (401k, vacation, sick time, insurance, paid medical leave etc.). I come home from work and my work is at the office, I don’t take anything home with me. I close my office door at 5pm and it’s “see ya tomorrow”. And the best part is, I actually really like my job. It’s fun and I’ve discovered new talents.Is my experience the experience of every MBA grad? No, certainly not. I had a lot of catching up and hard work to get there. I had family support and a full time job while doing school full time. I ate ramen noodles and hard boiled eggs for the better part of two years. I made significant relationships with advisors and professors. I asked the right questions.All in all my student loans amount to about $60,000. Pricey? Yeah, of course. But with my background I never would have obtained this type of job/salary without the MBA. So it was definitely worth it for me.You need to ask yourself, do you want to live to work or work to live?I prefer the latter.","2,730 followers",Victoria Zorzoli,1.2K,77,3.2M,https://www.quora.com/Would-healthcare-be-cheaper-if-doctors-weren-t-paid-as-much
