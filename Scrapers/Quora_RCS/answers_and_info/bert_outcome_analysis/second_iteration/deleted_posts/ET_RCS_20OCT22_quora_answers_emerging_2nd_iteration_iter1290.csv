2,"Here’s my crack at this….In hindsight it seems, at least in my opinion, excessive to have so much paperwork.I mean this series likes smears it on thick when it comes to “busy work”.Most of the recent Hokages have been seen stamping or signing stacks, upon stacks of papers. None of it is filed, stabled, or in folders. Just 4 ft stacks that appear from on high in order to drive the current Hokage “vHere’s my crack at this….In hindsight it seems, at least in my opinion, excessive to have so much paperwork.I mean this series likes smears it on thick when it comes to “busy work”.Most of the recent Hokages have been seen stamping or signing stacks, upon stacks of papers. None of it is filed, stabled, or in folders. Just 4 ft stacks that appear from on high in order to drive the current Hokage “victim” insane.Now modernized I expect Naruto to receive tons of emails, messages and letters from diplomatic figures from all around the world, from fans, from scholars, and teachers. He’d have to answer these by date, importance and/or order. That by itself takes quite a bit of time.The thing is though….the way the series presents Naruto’s method of coping w/ his responsibilities is ridiculous.I’m just gonna be honest…Naruto was trained to be a killer, a fighter, a team player. In no way was he trained to become an administrator, a philosopher, or a manager.Naruto strengths lie in being charismatic, diplomatic and expression. He’s a doer.The Hokage position is literally one of leadership.Naruto hasn’t even trained or lead a team of genins.What experience does he have w/ being a military leader?The series implies he’s “trained” off screen in scholastic subjects concerning his position; while Kakashi was at the mantle.The thing is being a Hokage is more than paperwork. You are literally dealing w/ the military defense and offense of your village. It’s nice if a Hokage is highly educated, because they have to wear various hats. Especially in the past, because the Hokage is essentially a “benevolent” dictator…that’s supposedly voted in.So for all of Naruto’s business….he’s actually only dealing w/ matters concerning the military and ninjas specifically.DelegationThis is where delegation concerning different departments that have been created or maintained over the years oughta be a thing.Just like any branch of government each industry or office has it’s own professionals that are knowledgeable concerning that topic.So, what about a treasury or budgeting office that deals w/ the military spending, equipment, and etc…Forms are filled out, filed and handled there; until it needs to be approve by the Hokage. There should be secretaries, accountants, and trained people to handle this task.What about people who oversee the education aspects. Who comes up w/ the curriculums for the military academies? Who decides on hiring teachers? Who decides what Jonin is suited to train certain genin? The Hokage has the final say, but who delegates? Who has the scholarly, domestic and international experience?Especially now, there are industries in existence that weren’t there when Naruto was a teen. So who decided on this?The Hokage?Was it important or did it concern the ninjas? Who by proper estimate are less then the average civilian.Do these industries need oversight by the Hokage? Or are there departments that deal w/ this? Do they risk village safety, are they violations or are they within protocol?The CiviliansWhat about the civilian side of things.Do the civilians really have anything to do w/ Naruto’s governing? Don’t they have their own council that communicates w/ the secretive ninja’s? Who exist in the peripherial and shadow of the average person.They ask for funding for certain things or permission when events concern the village in it’s entirety, or for security, but overall don’t they run their own industries.If a foreign entity comes into town than yes, they need to see the Hokage, go through the chain of commands and get permission. But if it’s local and self sustaining than what does the Hokage have to do w/ anything?Most civilians would probably consider the business/financial aspects of Konoha’s military to be seperate from their everyday life. Not unlike two very different worlds. The civilians outmatch the ninja’s 3 to 1 probably. They pay taxes, help w/ funding, and so some of their money goes to maintaining infrastructure, roads, food and paying the salaries of their local military. Outside of that, their money and business funnels back to them through industry.And Naruto’s only interaction w/ them has to be during meet and greets, classroom trips, local broadcast, and exclusive interviews. All of which should be excessive by this point. He seems to rarely leave Konoha and most of the locals know him, or are at least aware of him. They’ve had years to satisfy any curiosities.International IssuesNaruto has to communicate excessively w/ the leaders of other countries concerning open borders, trade, exams, and exchange programs.This is important and while Naruto, ultimately, makes the final decisions on these matters. Is he seriously trained for all of this?What experience does he possess to adequately discuss these topics?We can’t suddenly act like Naruto was super informed, educated and interested in studying world history, agriculture and etc….He trained for physical combat and to chase Sasuke. Neither of these apply to his current post. lolSo who does he listen to or get advice from? Who handles foreign affairs on his behalf when he’s too busy or isn't immediately available?Shikamaru may be intelligent, but he can’t be the only person around to ask. I’d see him valuable concerning trade and border patrole, but who estimates how much food is needed that can’t be grown within fire country?Who accesses the other villages when friendly competition is expected?I’d expect Naruto to be able to handle a S class nin or criminal by handing out legal judgement w/ a stroke of pen, and a word, but who handles less important matters like foreign transfer, or international goods over water?PopularityNaruto is a prolific figure true enough. Yet he’s only one man out of many who was involved in the war. Many gave their lives, and sanity to help fight Madara, nd Kaguya. Though Naruto is famous for fighting Kaguya, and Sasuke Uchiha.He helped the war efforts immensely, but all of the countries unified in order to survive.I’d see civilians hearing about Naruto and reading about him, but their lives aren’t connected to ninja affairs. So they’d see another famous shinobi w/ infamous feats. Impressive, but overall…not really concerning them.It’s different for actual members involved in the military. Naruto’s a living legends, not a star. Though after 15 yrs. it becomes common place enough, people have seen his face, spoken w/ him, worked w/ him and etc…New students experience the man they’ve only read about and are influenced by Naruto. He inspires new generations by being a role model, but that doesn’t or at least shouldn’t, take all of his time.In this modern age, Naruto oughta have an agent. Someone who maneuvers his schedule when dealing w/ the public. The Hokage isn’t just powerful, he’s personable, he’s friendly, he’s known, but once again, superficially for the public vs the private military sphere.Clan AffairsThis would be a definite area of interest. Naruto is about making compromises, so making sure clans are satisfied w/ the piece of their pie is a definite job. This is one category solely belonging to the Hokage. Inter-clan relations and all of the headaches associated w/ it.Here the Hokage is suppose to be neutral, as each clan is apart of the villages offense and defense; while certain clans make up key pillars.This is a constant game of checks and balances.Naruto has to constantly keep his ears open and this aspect is shared by no one. The paperwork dealing w/ this is probably ...",0 followers,Lunga Mnisi,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Narutos-Hokage-job-seem-to-be-a-lot-busier-than-previous-Hokage-s
3,"Because Naruto is a more focal character than any other Hokage thus far, so we see more of him working. That’s pretty much it.There’s no logical reason he should actually have a heavier workload. Hashirama founded Konoha, Tobirama most of its institutions, Hiruzen had like two world wars to handle, Tsunade dealt with the whole Akatuki mess and Kakashi managed the continuation of the Shinobi Alliance after the Fourth War. Minato can also be expected to have worked very heavily — not because he had a lot on his table comparatively, but because he was new at the job, so he probably didn’t know hoBecause Naruto is a more focal character than any other Hokage thus far, so we see more of him working.

4,"Simple answer actually, look at the size of the villages now compared to before Kakashi's reign, there are also no longer just ninja living in the villages, they are all popular areas and flourishing, which have attracted regular individuals (more people = more paperwork) the Hokage has to approve individuals visiting/moving into the village.Also note that for the first time in Shinobi history, all 5 villages have a peace pact, and though the Kage all respect eachother, they must also be very cautious of eachother's actions.

Naruto is the link between everybody, without him, peace would not be possible. Also I feel to a certain degree the Kage don't fully trust Sasuke still, they respect him, but only because Naruto puts a lot of faith in him. Being that Sasuke is the only individual able to actually do anything about the Oksutsuki, this tends to put tension between the other villages, relying so heavily on the Leaf village for information. This also means Naruto has to almost constantly be alert. The Suki could literally attack whenever, so he pushes himself past what any other previous Hokage has done to maintain safety for the village (I.e. When he was in the woods training the barrier team before the Chunin Exam Arc). On top of that, he also still runs top level missions here and there.Overall, it's just a really busy time for all of the 5 Kage. They have businesses booming in the villages, tourism, past blood creating tension (the new Swordsmen of the Mist).",10 followers,Bibek Baral,1.6K,75,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Narutos-Hokage-job-seem-to-be-a-lot-busier-than-previous-Hokage-s

6,"Naruto's era of being Hokage seems to be a lot like the post-World War 2 world of real life. There was a time when managing a country was literally that - managing that country. You had to deal with some things outside on occasion, whether that be feisty neighboring countries testing your borders or the British or Spaniards (or America) showing up (or demanding) to trade with you, but most of your concerns were internal.After World War 2, the UN was formed, and international concerns became a common part of any large nation's governmental concerns.Likewise, Naruto's generation has just enduredNaruto's era of being Hokage seems to be a lot like the post-World War 2 world of real life.

There are peacekeeping concerns far beyond Konoha's borders, and Naruto is the face of that peace. He's also presiding over the first era that seems to have active international media coverage…We didn't get as much of a peek into the personal lives and day-to-day operations of previous Hokages like Hiruzen & Tsunade, but I tend to suspect things in the chair were…perhaps not simpler in their time, given the wars…but more narrowly-focused. Their paperwork dealt with internal issues like organizing chuunin exams, making missions, classified information, and squad formations for border protection. Can you imagine the ridiculous amount of documents to sign and details to discuss for that field trip Boruto's academy class took to the Hidden Mist village?Tsunade's era marks the beginning of that transition, so she probably dealt with some of it as well. And Kakashi probably had his fair share of headache-inducing long nights and tense international situations to untangle, but he doesn't have a family waiting for him at home, so it probably was not as noticeable.And, like I said before…Naruto is the international face of peace, not Kakashi. As much as Kakashi played a major role in saving the world from the machinations of Madara, Obito, and Kaguya, Naruto is the one whose role is most known to every ninja. He's the guy who randomly showed up on every battlefield, rooting out the imposter Zetsus that were making it impossible to trust anyone. He used Kurama's chakra to protect each and every one of them on the battlefield and give them some added oomph to their combat abilities. He was the one they witnessed fighting Obito. He was the one they aided, freeing the bijuu from Obito's grasp. And it was Naruto's heartfelt feelings that were transmitted into all of their heads and hearts, inspiring them to keep going when all seemed lost. Naruto is their world's FDR, Churchill, Patton, and the jinchuuriki of the atomic bomb, if you will…The stakes probably feel higher for him in the chair than they did for Kakashi. Naruto practically lives at work sometimes, but I don't know that it's because he isn't managing the work well. I think he's just so passionate about what he's doing, and so uniquely positioned to have a role in all of it, that it's hard for him to stop worrying about what could go wrong when he leaves for the day and spends time with his family.*A footnote worth discussing: I use the term “War to end all wars” somewhat sardonically. In the real world, that was one of the things World War 1 was called, not WW2. World War 1 was such a unique and large affair compared to every war that came before it, that people wondered if the shocking amount of death that had occurred would scare humanity away from the entire concept of war.By the time World War 2 occurred, I think people realized that war wasn't going to stop permanently. Likewise, there were probably dreams of war ending forever after the peace of the First Shinobi World War, but they were back at it 20 years later. The 4th war is a truly worldwide war, so the hope again extends out that humanity might decide that enough is enough. But, it feels as if the only way that can occur is if no one makes any mistakes that restart the cycle of hatred. As we saw throughout the series, it's very hard for someone to give upPart of Naruto's hyper-vigilance is related to this. He's seen where that path leads, and he's been the one to give up on his revenge. But he knows how hard it was to do…and I think he's determined to try and prevent any circumstances from coming up on his watch that might lead to others having to make the same choice. That's a much larger scope of mission for a Hokage than any previous Hokage…and I think that's what makes it seem like so much of a heavier job than it should be.",0 followers,Vegeets,1.6K,114,502.7K,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Narutos-Hokage-job-seem-to-be-a-lot-busier-than-previous-Hokage-s

He looks good in front of people, and everyone listens when he speaks. He is universally respected in his world. Crises that cost his predescessors their lives are handled with a flick of his wrist. But for every document that took a previous Hokage 5 minutes to finish, it takes Naruto an hour. Unfortunately, that paperwork is the vast majority of what it means to be Hokage.Personally, I think it would have been sadly satisfying to have Naruto realize all this, and choose not to become the Hokage, instead finding another role as a protector and inspiration across the shinobi world. That would have shown a true will of fire, to sacrifice his dream for the betterment of all.","1,450 followers",Darian Carmichel,501,355,8.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Narutos-Hokage-job-seem-to-be-a-lot-busier-than-previous-Hokage-s
