They also think that Taiwan belongs to them, so they don’t worry too much if the equipment they need is available in Taiwan. TSMC could also be forced into the position of being a broker to get China the equipment they need. TSMC also may want to help get a Chinese equipment business going, just to help their own position and potentially lower their costs.So, yes, it would make sense for China to continue onMy crystal ball is broken, but I would say that it is likely that China is already working on it’s own semiconductor equipment.

1,"During the administration of President Obama, US prohibited the sales of parts and components for super computers to China. China then made its own parts and components. I can’t remember how long it took. I think the top 3 or 4 fastest super computers in the world reside in China today. These computers were made without any inputs from the US, indeed exclusively from China’s own technology, without any foreign parts and components.I recognise the technology, parts, and components for the super computers are specific-purpose production & use, as distinct from mass production and multiple uses.During the administration of President Obama, US prohibited the sales of parts and components for super computers to China.

So they are not directly comparable with semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. But what is common is that China has plentiful of talents, whose number, sophistication, and expertise, are constantly being refreshed and growing day by day. And its determination to fulfill its technology ambition can only strengthen as impediments and road-blocks are put on its way.US has for long periods tried to frustrate China’s advance in technology. President Trump’s administration is not the first one to do so. It only becomes more flagrant, making claims and charges, and extending the range of products and activities by the liberal use of the “national security” label. There is now even the idea to ban Chinese students from STEM education in the US. This is clearly a low move and an indication of frustrations, that all its attempts have not been effective.US refused to cooperate or exchange knowledge with China on space technology. Still China became the first nation on earth to land on the far side of the moon. It also manipulated the use of its GPS especially on military application. China now has its own Beidou global positioning system. Google banned Huawei the use its proprietary apps. Huawei has developed its own Hongmeng apps. Surely, there are many more.It will of course take time for China to build its own semiconductor equipment and semiconductors, but it will definitely do so. As mentioned above, it has plentiful talents and unshaken determination. It has already the semiconductor industry. Upgrades and advances in sophistication of production and products for high-end applications are frequently reported.Note also that EU countries, Japan, S.Korea, and Taiwan have also expertise and industries in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment, They do not have the druthers of the US and are quite happy to trade with China. So, the world will still go round despite the US belligerence.",1 follower,Xitong Zou,6.1K,3K,11.9M,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-develop-its-own-semiconductor-equipment-industry

For me, it brings up questions about our understanding of technology and the world. It seems that most people visualize UFOs or ET civilizations as linear progressions of our own. For example, we might imagine that UFOs are something like very advanced rocket-ships.In this way, we use things like SETI radio telescopes to look for ET out there. We expect that they have highly advanced versions of our own technology and that we need to develop mechanical propulsion systems or faster-than-light communications or some such thing.However, it is very very important to note that this notion of linear technological process within the physical realm is maybe 600 years old and is only adopted by cultures that are supported by aggressive militaristic empires.When we look to worldviews outside of our relatively immature and demonstrably short-sided culture, we see testimony that indeed humanity has been in contact with ET through both psycho-spiritual experience and physical experiences. You can look to the Hopi, Dogon, and Aborigine to see such testimony.The recent work of the FREE/CCRI institute, which was a survey of 4.5k experiences of the UFO phenomenon, come to the hypothesis that consciousness is primary and that these phenomenon rely on the sort of quantum nature of consciousness.What might technology based in consciousness look like? Well, you could look to the Tibetan Buddhists for an example. There literally cases of telepathy, levitation, and teleportation. These seem outlandish and impossible, but that might be because our own consciousness have been so manipulated by an aggressive empire that we no longer can connect the possibilities here. Actually, the Tibetan Buddhists do have testimony of ET contact, I’m thinking here of the protector diety Rahula.CE-5, popularized by Dr. Steven Greer, does indicate that we can make contact with ET. CE-5 is a protocol for human initiation of ET contact. Sometimes these protocols do involve technology, like the radio contact methodology put forward by Jimmy Blanchette and Mark Sims. Most of the time, the protocol is a simple meditation.I work with public data professionally and I support the citizen-science collection of CE-5 testimonies. There is an overwhelming amount of testimony and I would even say evidence that ET is here and does respond to human initiated contact through consciousness.However, it is very difficult to accept or believe in that evidence. I have literally been shown photos of craft by people who are extremely technological and grounded, I believe in the phenomenon, but I see the photo and say to myself, “that can’t be real.” Consequently, I care less about evidence and more about testimony.Consciousness isn’t an objective experience. It is non-dual, meaning it is beyond the duality of subject and object. The entire world is like the double-slit light experiment. Therefore, it doesn’t really respond to requests for objective evidence. Rather, it invites you to a co-creative and co-participatory journey of self-discovery.","220,211 followers",Franklin Veaux,679,47.3K,779.7M,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-develop-its-own-semiconductor-equipment-industry

Or more particularly why do we think they need to or should contact us? Only one reason springs initially to mind - that existence of intelligent life in the cosmos (essentially ‘our galaxy’) could be exceedingly rare. And that would predicate the approaches from insatiably curious ETs with the expectation that ‘they’ could already know about degrees of rarity? The latter point means to say that they have sufficient hegemony of inquisitiveness for encounters with Earth to not be chance encounters! With the eye-watering vastness of space, any random search by relatively conventional technology (that humans could recognise) would be impossibly long to yield any results at all, whether by ETs on a one-way ‘ark’ mission or a report-back mission (even more implausible). No, for any ETs to be able to have a targeted campaign of enquiry about Earth, they would need to be millions of years more advanced that modern mankind and conducting a campaign “with us humans in mind”.As all good college exam papers then conclude: “Discuss”.",0 followers,Wayne Boyd,1K,5.1K,13.6M,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-develop-its-own-semiconductor-equipment-industry

21,"Sad as it is, I’ll have to admit thatBut what on earth would a socieSad as it is, I’ll have to admit thatBut what on earth would a society without electricity be like? This must have startled you electricity users. Due to the limit of words, it would be too challenging to draw the whole picture of the society. I’ll just go with the lighting functions. (For the rest, a visit to China guaranteed a sudden enlightenment.)For lighting after dawn, if you have any doubt, we Chinese definitely don’t use candles, nor oil lamps, not even lanterns, the light is too dim and the devices are highly dependent upon surrounding environments. What’s more, they are ancient, but we are now living in a modern society. Electricity certainly speaks for modern society in some aspects, yet access to it shouldn’t be identified with access to modern lifestyles. As an exception, as always, we Chinese are able to make use of a mysterious creature for alternative light source and it is called theJust kidding, that’s a totem.A more delicate one.Okay, here comes a real one.Beautiful creatures, aren’t they?Allow me to introduce to you a piece of the ancient Chinese myth, so you will have a basic information of the creature. This story came up inShe gave birth to ten suns, the(Any inspirations?Yes. We did find a way to breed and multiply the raven. The side effects brought by the procedures weakened the raven’s ability to create light and heat, which in turn became a convenience in practical use. So here is how the lighting system goes. By the time each child in China is born, a new-born raven would be bond to the infant. The raven would be his or her “light” in that the ravens are pretty much tiny suns, and it will be each individual’s obligation to care for his or her raven friend.As you can imagine, profound relationships would be cultivated between the creature and human being. I heard that there was an old couple whose ravens suffered fatal injuries and eventually died, and the couple refused with unyielding resistance to live with other ravens. They lived by natural sunlight ever since, for they have lost the light of their lives._________________________________________________________________________________It’s really touching how human could sustain such loyalty towards animal friends in a fast-paced society like this. HOWEVER, the story is made up, by myself.You know, such a dumb question on quora indeed put me in an amazed silence. It’s both hilarious and thought-provoking how some people hold their stubborn stereotypes on China. Which modern society doesn’t have access to electricity? Electricity was introduced to China more than a century ago. It is recorded that the technology was first introduced on May 28th, 1879, where the Electrical Engineer, Mr. Bishop carried out an experiment on an electrically powered lamp. (In fact, ever since 2011, China has been taking the lead in both electricity production and consumption. (Still, I think I owe you many thanks for giving me this opportunity to share the ancient Chinese myth. I was really sincere doing that part, and I cordially invite you to China to witness its rapid development and profound changes._________________________________________________________________________________BTW, remember this?

The first,, also the main reason, it’s too hard to equipment,. barriers to lots of giant machines, electronic towers and lines...etc in there are higher than others regions, if we want transport tools that’s means we also need to dig ways. Can any countries dig ways on these places where beaten track? Obviously no, even you could, you must be pay based on multiples of number 100.

The tickets are also affordable to the common people of China so the ridership is going high every year and has already surpassed 1 Billion mark.India has started a high speed rail project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad which has brought enormous criticisms from oppositions.

In China, the government knows how to get things done. There is corruption too but it's far less than in India. People do have some fear of the government as they do not have a choice of an opposition.

None has come so far.Update:Indian Railways is looking to clock its worst Operating Ratio ever, at around 98.5 per cent in 2017-18, despite best efforts by its book-keepers to make things look better than they actually are.The figure of around 98.5 per cent is a major face saver as it seemed like in the normal course, without some “adjustments”, the operating ratio — money spent to earn every hundred rupees; the lower the better — would cross the 100-per cent mark. Some timely “earnings” and “adjustments” have shown the ratio to be lower, even though it is still worse than the Revised Estimate (RE) of 96 per cent, sources told The Indian Express.In short, the Indian Railways is flat out broke. There’s no recovery of capital costs, and no money for investment.I will not blame Mr. Modi for the mess. The mess has been created by previous governments. However, they have fudged the figures. If the Operating Ratio is more than 100 - say 101 - it means that you spend 101 rupees to earn 100 rupees. Whew!This needs major reforms. Better food, wifi at railway stations. better toilets - good, but not close to solving the problem. Now if the loss was due to high quality service, I could accept it as a form of subsidy. But, that’s not the reason for the loss. Again, Mr. Modi did not create this problem. But, this is what he should be trying to solve - not focus on bullet trains.We need a minister with political clout who has the backing of the PM to come up with plans to modernize all of Indian Railways, and make their financial condition viable. Not necessary to make profits - but such high Operating Ratios plus lousy service for the common man - that’s not acceptable.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,10.7K,5.6K,426.5M,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-develop-its-own-semiconductor-equipment-industry
42,"India should do it on its own. Such projects are long drawn projects because of various issues related to land, environment, financial, and so on.

43,"China has developed its economy rapidly in past decade. They have been running bullet trains since mid-2000s; They have executed manned space missions; They have come up with claimed 5th gen fighter jets (although design seems to be identical significantly to western jets); Their super computers are giving tough competition.India has better industrial & diplomatic ties with Japan. Moreover, neighboring countries always will have either good partnerships or tough competition.

46,"Think of it this way. Is it good to invest in airlines and express trains when more people use passenger trains and buses? And is it good to invest in buses and passenger trains when many villagers still use bullock carts? Should not the government be investing in the fastest bullock carts? That would be absurd.Government should not just plan for 2016, but also for 2030.

Is it good to invest in airlines and express trains when more people use passenger trains and buses?

That would be absurd.Government should not just plan for 2016, but also for 2030. The investments in highways and metro trains 15 years ago are now paying off as we zip through the highways and trains. By 2030, we would have 4 times bigger economy and 20 crore more people in the middle class. How are we going to move them?The middle class of 2030 would choke without fast transportation. Airports would be clogged, roads would be beyond their capacity and express trains cannot move people fast enough. On the other hand, bullet trains can transport people fast enough for them to leave their cars and planes behind.By moving the entrepreneurs and merchants fast enough, we can produce a lot more value to the economy. Would you rather have a productive entrepreneur stuck in a slow moving train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad or be producing something useful on the ground? Again when the merchant leaves the polluting cars and airplanes for an electricity driven bullet train, we can have cleaner skies [assuming in parallel we can move out of coal as a producer of electricity]. The bullet trains can reduce the acute scarcity in availability of train tickets as well as reduce accidents [the alternate is the much riskier car transportation].Two centuries ago people would not have comprehended the need for a train. Horses and oxen did their job well. Now, it is hard to imagine India without its railways. We have to now get into the next era of innovation. High speed trains are the future as we can see in Europe and east Asia. They are far more cleaner and convenient than air travel and much more convenient than regular train travel. It would push both business and tourism.The same answer also applies to why India invests in Mars missions & lunar landings when some basics like water and electricity needs to be fixed. Of course, we have to invest in the basics too, but this idea of sequentially doing things doesn't always work. We have to build the basics as well as the advanced sciences in parallel.Just as a student eats for today as well as studies for the exams to come in a few months, we have to invest our efforts in both present as well as the future. Just as a driver looks both at the traffic ahead as well as mentally plans his route, we have to think both long and short.We cannot let our present cloud our future.Also see:",49 followers,Awdhesh Singh,2.5K,5.3K,218.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-advancement-in-technology-would-we-need-for-extraterrestrials-to-contact-us
