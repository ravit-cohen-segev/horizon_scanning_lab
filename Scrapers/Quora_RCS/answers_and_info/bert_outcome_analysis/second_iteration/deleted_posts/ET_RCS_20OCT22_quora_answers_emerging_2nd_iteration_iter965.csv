The computer is essentially solving a giant matrix equation at discrete time steps..An example is calculating trajectories for space probes, especially if you’re using a gravity assist. You can simulate the path the probe will follow assuming different launch times, locations and rocket performance - each simulation follows the probe as it is affected by the gravity of the planets. With a supercomputer you can do thousands (or millions) of different starting conditions and find the range of possibilities that “work” for a given application.A similar application is simulating the approach to Mars and the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL). There’s always uncertainties in the position measurements on the way there, and you have some opportunities for trajectory correction maneuvers. You can simulate a range of starting points and maneuvers and figure out the most likely successful sequence of maneuvers.I’ve used a supercomputer to evaluate designs for antennas on the surface of the Moon that form a radio telescope. This is a good example of where we want to know how big to make individual elements of the system, so we simulate the behavior of 128 antennas, at several hundred frequencies, while we change the layout and size of the antennas. Here, any one frequency or layout might take less than a minute on a PC, but to do all of them takes hours or days. Using the cluster, I can iterate through a series of trials with a few minutes each and get “the big picture” in less than a day. As R.W. Hamming (the guy who invented Hamming Error Correcting Codes) said some time ago “The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.” - The supercomputer lets me come up with a new way to do something in a week, rather than months.Here’s an article about using supercomputers at TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center) to figure out where Percy should go:",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,1.1K,12.9K,66.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-favorite-fictional-spaceship-that-nobody-else-talks-about

Like any good film SLR camera, it isn't picky, and will operate with any film you prefer.The question then becomes, what film do YOU prefer?That really is going to be your quest, but I can suggest a few liked films that are commonly available to try out and why you might have a use for them.SLIDE FILM.If you are into perusing little tiny and richly colored pictures through a magnifying device, or all your victories arrayed on the light table. Fuji Velvia 50 is an absolute favorite. It makes impossibly rich yellows and turns oranges deeper toward red, which makes it incredible for landscapes and terrible for portraits. Provia 100F is still slide film but a little better for portraits. Slide film is limited in range though, so a scene with super dark shadows and bright, sunlit objects will force you to choose one of the two. No more being lazy and HDR stacking. Oh, wait. You could totally do that. Also, the rich reds and yellows will break your heart. Modern scanning, digital color spaces, computer displays and printing technologies cannot print much of the color you can see in a slide. Remember that with slides, you have no leeway for error. Color problems, exposure mistakes... all are plain to see because there is nothing like a print between you and the film. This makes it great for learning and sharpening your skills.PRINT FILM.Print film is different, and a lot more forgiving. It is made to scan, has wide dynamic range, and is easy to use. Exposure errors also have less brutal effects. Fuji Superia 400 (usually says X-TRA on the front) is super inexpensive, and looks great. Kodak Portra 160 and Kodak Ektar 100 are arguably more serious films that also look really good. The differences are not as pronounced as the slides because there is post processing required to make an image that looks anything like a picture. In this processing, things like white balance and exposure are adjusted. Some print films have ruddy reds, like the old Kodak Gold, but they can all produce a great picture in the right conditions, and many even in the wrong conditions.BLACK AND WHITE FILM.This is a rewarding area. Black and white films are very inexpensive, and the lack of color forces you t oconcentrate on forms, texture and light. That and it's a ton of fun. Once you really master the images, you can fine tune the films by doing your own processing, which opens up another whole world of ideas and discoveries. Arista EDU 100 from freestylephoto is a really cool and super inexpensive film. It has a weird look, like an older technology material. Blues render lighter than reds like older films. It isn't super fast. I wouldn't say it is 100 speed in the first place, and it is grainy for the speed. The film base is an odd color. Why would anyone use it? Because it is awesome. Ilford HP5+ is the standard film you should start with. It is functionally the same as Kodak Tri-X and many people can't tell the difference. Really good, general purpose film that looks nice. Tmax 100 is a very high performance film that is hard to use in small format. Highlights blow out easily if you don't have the right printing equipment. Grain often doesn't look any smaller contrary to claims. On a digital scanner things are even worse. It takes special washing to remove the pink stain after processing. But when you get it right, Tmax pictures have a sharp, metallic realism that looks very interesting. On diffuser enlarging equipment, you can also unlock an incredible range of exposure beyond what you can with condensers and common scanners and excellently smooth tones, smooth grain and sharp details. Although I think it is better suited to large format cameras, Tmax is a very satisfying challenge. Delta 100 and 400 from Ilford are technically like Tmax, but easier to use, and feel to behave in between Tmax and Traditional films like HP5+. Another good one is Ilford Delta 3200. It is super fast and has coarse, but soft looking grain. Not a lot of detail, but very lovely.WEIRD OTHER FILM:You could also try out Ilford XP2, which is not really a black and white film at all. It's a colorless film that is processed like color negative film, so you send it to a minilab like any color film. Super smooth tones, subdued grain. and a scooped out contrast curve, so if you overexpose, the middle tones are bright, like sitting on a cloud, and if you underexpose, the middle tones are darker even when white and black are in place. Could be of interest.The AE-1 was the camera that popularized SLR photography and brought Canon to the forefront. You can drop any of these films in, set the ISO/ASA speed, run out and shoot some pics. It would be best to get about a half dozen rolls of something rather normal, and shoot one at a time to get used to how they do things. Only shoot the next roll after you look at the results from the last roll. After you get really comfortable, then you could try a different film, since you now have experience to compare. Just shooting one roll of each will just be confusing.All the tricks and tips are just about photography as there is literally nothing strange about the AE-1. It is just a camera, so you don't have to worry about knowing anything specific as long as you know the battery is good, and you know how to load and unload the film. There are an almost infinite array of YouTube videos detailing loading and operating the AE-1.Youtube search for loading AE-1Just get out there and make some pics.Very excited for you.

7,"Canon FD-Series SLRs- I sold Canon's AE-1 and other FD-series cameras working at a photo specialty store in the 1970s.

The zoom broke mechanically about every six months, when the front section separated. I tolerated it because of the f/3.5 maximum aperture at all focal lengths, a rarity for zooms at the time.Both cameras used Canon's QL loading system - pull out a 4"" tongue of film, drop the cassette into the camera, close the back, advance a couple frames, and start shooting. It was very simple and reliable. The cameras and lenses were built like tanks.The main drawback of FD-series cameras today is the lack of new lenses.Use Any 35mm FilmMy films of choice were Kodachrome 64, Kodachrome 200 and Ektachrome 64. I sometimes also used Ektachrome 160. The high-speed films were good for shooting pro mountain bike races in overcast light.Slide film has very narrow exposure latitude -  1-2 stops at most. You have to hit exposure close to right or you blow out highlights or lose shadow detail.I started with Plus-X and Tri-X black-and-white film I processed and enlarged myself. That was an inexpensive way for a 13-year-old to shoot. Tri-X especially had up to 8 stops of exposure latitude, but could give grainy results.I never liked print film. It was expensive to process, and you needed prints to see what you had. It was much easier to throw slides on a light table, whip out a loupe, and check out the sharpness and colors you got.Color print film has more exposure latitude than slide film, ~3 stops.Many Film Types Discontinued - Processing May Be Tough To FindToday, Kodak no longer manufactures Kodachrome or Ektachrome. You can still buy Fuji Velvia slide film (E6 processing) and a variety of C-22 process color print films like Kodak Ektar, as well as black-and-white.But the bigger problem is processing. I would find a good color processing lab before investing further in 35mm film camera gear.EOS Film Camera Future-Proofs Your LensesIf you want to use film, I suggest picking up an EOS film camera.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

11,"1. This is more of a lighting trick than a camera trick, although obviously the framing of the shot is very important:Usually when someone in a scene turns on or off a light, they aren’t really turning on or off a light.This is because once a set is lit, with all those specific lights to get a good exposure and artistic mood, turning on a “practical” (the term for a prop on the set that actually is what it is: a lamp, a radio, a fan, etc.) won’t accomplish much or won’t “read” as believable in the scene.

So the actor most often will just pretend to turn off or on a light while a gaffer off screen will turn off/on the actual set and practical lights (usually a brighter bulb in the lamp that needs to be timed with set lights that supplement it) being used to mimic the action on screen.Put another way, a person on a couch with a lamp nearby in real life is not a good image. So in film they will do what’s called “cheating” which in this case means that practical lamp will be used as the imagined source for very nice soft “fill light” on the actor. It might even be used to justify some nice backlight on the actor, some rim light on the shoulder, all things that a simple table lamp in real life won’t provide. So if for some reason that light is turned off, then suddenly a new lighting design is required where other lights, such as moonlight, or a street lamp, will be the main sources of light.So the next time you see someone roll over in bed to turn off the light, most often their hand just goes under the lamp shade and pauses while lights for the set, maybe fake moonlight through the window, whatever, are clicked on/off, with the correct lamp switch2. A pure camera trick from the days of traditional film that I always found clever was the old flip-the-camera-upside-down trick.Now why would you want to flip the camera upside down? Well so that what you were filming would be upside down, of course. And why would you want that exactly? Well when you cut that piece of film into the movie, you can flip it right side up again! Only this will require putting the head of the shot where the tails is, and visa-versa. And this means your shot is now right side up but backwards! Sure you could have used expensive optical printer work to make that traffic on the 405 run backwards, but this does the same thing only cheaper and without adding any more grain to your film! Just double check before you do it that your film has sprocket holes on both edges!3. And finally probably the greatest camera trick in movies doesn’t even use the camera at all. Yes the amazing apple box!This humble piece of equipment is so essential it should come standard with every camera. With this well worn often creaky invention all kinds of magic can be done! But you don’t want to call it magic. No, in the film world you don’t lie, you cheat!Need to cheat an actor in front of the camera so he looks a bit taller? Bring in the apple box. Need to cheat that foreground object up so it makes a better composition? In comes an apple box. Need to get that boom mic out of your shot? Well by all means give that boom operator an apple box or two!

Also, learn to read the technical sheets that every film company produces for each type of film.Slide or positive film: I’ve shot predominantly with slide film since I got my first 35mm SLR. I have a bias towards saturated colors, and my favorite is Fuji Velvia 100. 100F is probably better for skin tones, but I don’t generally photography people. You must be accurate in your exposures—there is far less exposure latitude in slide film than in any type of negative film. The advantage to Velvia is very strong, saturated colors.Kodak is apparently flirting with bringing back Kodachrome, which I used for many years, until I found that the cooler color palette of Ektachrome and Velvia were closer to the way in which I see color. If you shoot film, realistically you will want to scan it into digital form, and Ektachrome and Velvia do very well with that. The quality of prints you get is a function of how good your printer is, Kodak will reissue professional 100 speed Ektachrome later this year, and I look forward to trying it.I haven’t much to say about color negative film, since I use it rarely.Black and white—a huge number of options. I enjoy doing night photography with some of the very high speed films from Ilford. For daylight shooting, I like Fuji Neopan 100. I’ve never gone all the way with black and white to developing and printing myself.

Also, don’t ever open your camera in broad daylight lest you ruin the film that’s out of the canister.A corollary to this is make sure the film is loaded properly. If the film should pop off the take-up spool, it won’t be pulled thru the camera and you won’t have any pictures to develop. So be sure to check that.Load and unload your film in subdued light and then process your film promptly or store it in a cool place until you do.Unlike digital cameras with media cards that can hold hundreds even thousands of shots, you will be limited to about three dozen at most before you must change rolls. So be sure that you bring along enough film because you don’t want to run out and bring more than you think you’ll need just in case because film is cheaper than opportunity!","3,930 followers",Anumeha Sharma,37.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-film-for-a-Canon-AE-1-What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-can-be-done-shooting-with-this-film

Working hard in the right direction is what is going to take you somewhere.There are four ways in which you can approach the direction and become a Film Director.They are not the only ways.You can find your own way when you are there or you can discover some other ways too but overall some part of those ways will go through these ways only, I can assure you that.I have figured out these ways based on my experience and talks with other directors and upcoming directors.Here they are -Point 1 — Become an assistant.If you have any connection in Bollywood or Mumbai film fraternity, I would suggest that you should not waste even a minute doing anything else but join a big director as his assistant.There is no better way than this.I assume that if you already had such connections you wouldn’t be reading this article. So I won’t elaborate much on this.I know many well-connected kids who joined Yashraj and Dharma films as they had god connections inside it.These two production houses in Mumbai today are biggest promoters of nepotism right now.But let me warn you, everything that appears gold is not gold.None of the big production houses pays good and living cost in Mumbai is really very high.Most of the assistants in Dharma and Yashraj comes in their expensive SUVs that even some of the actors don’t have.Most of them are rich kids.So, don’t be disillusioned that you can survive without any help if you will work in Yashraj and Dharma.More than that if you don’t have money, you will never be accepted as a part of their community until you have a very extrovert personality.Being born to a rich and privileged family comes handy in Mumbai.These two production houses are the biggest name and brand in Mumbai and if you have worked even in one project in them than you will never find any dearth of money and work.I worked for merely one day in Yashraj. They needed an assistant for just one day.They had started another big budget movie and most Ads went there. There were only a few days of shoot left so they didn’t bother calling big assistants.They needed interns and I got the job for one day.Again, because I had a connection inside with someone I had worked in a film before.Most of my job later came to me because I had Yashraj name in my resume.Directors would read my resume and then would stop at the mention of Yashraj Films, then look at me, ask a few questions and I was in.There is an assumption that if you work at Yashraj or Dharma than you are good and also rich. This is partly true actually.There are Ads inside which are working there based on pure merit and they are very really good. I, however, don’t know any of them.Most production houses have assistant directors and there is a word called “intern” which is mercilesslyMy advice — Even if you get to work for free in a good production house, go for it.An Important thing — It is not useful to work in just any film to make your resume.The director and the stars in the film matter. If on one hand you have a film which has an arrogant director and huge stars and on the other hand is a film which has decent cast and an unknown director, go for the former one because that film in your resume will get you more work.Tolerate them for some time and your life will be more sorted.However, if you are new in the city and don’t have any work, just start doing whatever comes your way. After all, the beggars can’t be choosers.There are no strict rules about choosing which film you must go with.In India, people remember film names and you are praised to be part of it.In the Mumbai film industry, Film does not matter, production house does.The better the production, the better your resume. Even if you have worked in a major disaster likeNow it does not matter under which circumstances you do what film or which project, just remember this thing — work hard and make great contacts because it is this and nothing else that will give you more work.Don’t just make contacts with people on top like director, producer, Ads but make contacts with everyone on set.You never know who can help you for whatever reason.I once befriended a spot boy. He was working for the whole day and was very hungry. I took him to a restaurant nearby and treated him with sandwiches and tea. He was so thankful to me that later he called me for meetings and get me several works.I once met Nawazuddin Siddiqui and I didn’t entertain him much because he looked like nothing, later he became a big celebrity.Be nice to everyone. You never know who will become what in the future.Point 2 — Direct your own film.This is a tough option.This is not an easy one and is only applicable to crazy ones out there.But as Steve Jobs said -One who is crazy enough to think that he can change the world will be the one who will change it.However, people who are reading it, please don’t take this on ego.This route has its own pros and cons and sometimes it backfires too.It is also not a sure shot way to success. The entire process is very difficult if you don’t have money, connections and if you are a first timer.You will face millions of obstacles, humiliation and resistance from all sides and none of it gives assurance that it can be a success.To begin with, understand what kind of director you want to become.Director of an independent low budget feature film does not win that much accolades in India as they win in other countries. India is not a place where you will be appreciated for your art. You instead be labelled as an “Art Film Director”.Who came up with that name, no one knows but this nametag is a sign that your films do not make any money.Only a commercial director gets easy money to make his next film.There are people I have met in my life who had all the reasons for not doing something.They won’t do anything but rant about how they don’t have any money and how they don’t have any resources to create something.Those people will never be able to direct or do anything in life.For directing an independent film, you need lots of guts, courage, patience and lots of persistence.You have to collect an entire team of people who are willing to work for you literally cheap or for free and then start shooting your movie.The first part of starting to make your own movie will start from faith. If you don’t have faith in your own film, no one else will come to help you out.I went to a filmmaker once to ask him for some advice on my screenplay. At the end of the conversation, he asked me how sure I am about making this film.I tried to give him a diplomatic answer and said 99%. I thought that this amount of surety is enough for making a movie.He told me that my movie will never get made.I asked him why and he said that the day I have 100% confidence in my script, only then it will get made and that day, I won’t have to make any efforts to make it.That script is still lying in my drawer and never got made.Point 3 — Join an ad agency.This one is a really comfortable option and the coolest way to become a director however the route will take a long time.Though one thing is sure, there won’t be any struggle and you will at least live a comfortable life.This is something that is tried by hundreds of ad films directors in Mumbai. Only a few turn up to make films but even if you don’t, you won’t struggle and that’s for sure.How does it work?First, join an ad agency and start working there as a copywriter. If you are young and enthusiastic and ready to work for literally no money, there won’t be much problem you will face getting a job as a copywriter.There is always an opening for a copywriter in ad agencies. The more the better.If they say they don’t have a vacancy, then there are chances they don’t want to hire you or the company is going through a bad phase.With time, escalate up in the agency and become a senior copywriter. Go to meetings, meet clients and increase your network over post-work parties.Then someday shoot some film for some client who does not have enough budget to hire a production house. Voila, your career as a filmmaker starts.This is how you make your showreel.Then leave the agency and start your own production house. Since everyone in the agency knows you and other agency guys also know you (Remember more the networking, better will be the resultsNow start taking work from them and begin shooting your films.The best part of ad filmmaking is that you don’t have to know anything about the direction to shoot an ad film.Most of the ad film directors I have worked with don’t do much and don’t have any idea about how ad films are shot.They rely heavily on the highly knowledgeable DOP who knows that a part of his job along with shooting the ad film will be to help the director in telling what shots need to be taken.Hire a well-experienced Ad (Assistant Director) who can run the set and then relax behind the monitor.Ad will take shots, DOP will shoot and you can comfortably take your name as the director because you know one thing that others on set don’t — How to deal with clients and get ad films from them.But this is just halfway to the goal. This won’t take you far away.After directing a lot of commercials and gathering a lot of money, begin writing the script for your feature film.Since you have directed so many commercials it won’t be that difficult to find a producer for you.Directing commercials also gives you contact with lots of actors knowing whom otherwise is a big advantage.So, get your script ready, contact the actors, meet a financier and get going.If that doesn’t work out, keep directing ad films. It is a nice money-making job.Point 4 — Join a film school.Now this is the safest option on the road. This is like doing engineering or MBA from a good school so that you can land up a job.However, there is no other institute in India of the calibre of FTII and SFTII or Adyar Film Institute in Chennai which not just teaches you but also gives you ample contacts so that you never go without a job once you are in your respective film city.I know people who have been jobless even after that doing a course from FTII, it was because they were terribly arrogant and felt that they are so great that the world owes them everything.They end up getting frustrated and later die in oblivion cursing the film industry.Joining film school is a wise decision no matter people say.There are filmmakers who boast about never being to film school and did everything on their own.Truth is, they most applied for the film school but didn’t get accept.Behind every successful director who boasts about doing everything on his own, there are numerous directors who tried the same thing but just couldn’t make the cut.Don’t be egoistic about going to film school.If you get the chance to learn and master the art at a good film school, do it.Don’t be a Tarantino follower who proudly says he didn’t go to a film school. Going to a film school is the best thing you can do for yourself.But I would strictly advise against going to any private film school in India. They will charge you an exorbitant amount of fees, you won’t learn anything much there and later they won’t help you in getting any jobs.Not that the government-funded institutes will help you in getting jobs but what government colleges have is culture, traditions and love for alma mater.Lots of successful people in Film industry often roams the streets of FTII reminiscing their old days and meet young students, connect with them and when they come to Mumbai help them find their way by giving them work and place to live.Private film schools don’t have that love for alma mater and if seniors ever come back on campus, they are paid to do that, they don’t come back for the love of institution.—These are four methods of entering inside the film industry and get success as a director.I hope my advice will help you gain some perspective because at least now you will have some direction in which way to go and which way not to go.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,526,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-film-for-a-Canon-AE-1-What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-can-be-done-shooting-with-this-film

23,"Mostly varieties of Linux these days. However, there is a school of thought that compute nodes should run stripped-down OSs, so they don’t get in the way of applications so much. One of these is “Compute Node Linux”.HPC programs, which are called “codes” by the insiders, tend not to use the OS very much. They may read or write files, typically from highly parallel filesystems, and they certainly do network I/O, but the attitude of the typical HPC application programmer about the OS is “map me all the memory, give me direct access to the interconnect interface, and then keep out of my way”ThereMostly varieties of Linux these days.

They may read or write files, typically from highly parallel filesystems, and they certainly do network I/O, but the attitude of the typical HPC application programmer about the OS is “map me all the memory, give me direct access to the interconnect interface, and then keep out of my way”There is a phenomenon in HPC called “OS interference”. Suppose that the OS has various housekeeping tasks that run for 0.001 seconds every second or so. 0.1% overhead, no big deal, right? Now suppose the application is a 1000 node parallel program that has to coordinate the progress of the nodes once a second or so. Boom! Somewhere in the system, one of the nodes is ALWAYS out to lunch doing something or other. Maybe running lpd. Who knows? The net result is that 999 nodes are waiting for the 1000th, and that 0.1% overhead is magnified 1000 times! Half of the compute power of the cluster is lost to this tiny OS thing. It is no wonder that HPC programmers hate the OS.Another sore point is the network. On a good day, the end to end latency of an Ethernet hop using 10 Gbps Ethernet, is about 5 microseconds. That is <forever> for HPC. Well designed Infiniband adapters and switches routinely achieve latency below 1 microsecond. At these speeds, it just takes too long to call the OS to send or receive a packet. Instead, HPC networks often use “OS Bypass” in which the application (or more likely a user mode library) can directly talk to the I/O adapter. The software pathlength from the application calling SEND to bits on the wire is often below 200 machine instructions. That just cannot be done with the OS in the way. Even the encoding of Ethernet frames is so bad for latency that it tends to make HPC engineers grouchy. 64/66 codes? Yechh.And don’t get me started about virtual memory. Anytime someone says “virtual” you should think “slow”.",38 followers,Scott Rainey,2.3K,2.5K,6.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-favorite-fictional-spaceship-that-nobody-else-talks-about
