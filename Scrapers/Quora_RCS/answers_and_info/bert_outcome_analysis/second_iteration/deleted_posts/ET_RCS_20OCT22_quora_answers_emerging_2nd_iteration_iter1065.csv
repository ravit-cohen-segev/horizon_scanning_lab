The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation. Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of ta...",167 followers,Tim Brown,805,1.4K,1.7M,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-is-more-advanced-in-terms-of-technology-and-economy-Japan-or-China

6,"Chinas lag behind Japan is essentially on four points(a) Technological Edge -The Distance is getting shorter and shorter as China is spending billions on Research and Development but Japan had an almost 28 year advantage over China from 1964 to 1992 when thanks to being bankrolled with US Money - the Japanese made huge strides in manufacture from small cottage industries to megaChinas lag behind Japan is essentially on four points(a) Technological Edge -The Distance is getting shorter and shorter as China is spending billions on Research and Development but Japan had an almost 28 year advantage over China from 1964 to 1992 when thanks to being bankrolled with US Money - the Japanese made huge strides in manufacture from small cottage industries to mega corporations to billion dollar research.Japanese focus on Engine Technology, Automobiles, Enterprise Servers, Robotics, MLAI etc in which they have a huge edge over China.China still focusses on Mass Manufacture of Mobile Phones or Laptops.Another 15 years to go experts predict before China can bridge the Gap.(b) Research Workforce -The Evolution of the Japanese Research is more long term and successful while the Evolution of the Chinese Researcher is more short term and less successful.The Chinese researcher is like Narendra Modis government. Always wants results in the shortest time and generally messes things up and lies about it in Global Times.This Attitude means that except Foreign Educated Researchers - most local researchers are Harried and work under tremendous pressure which automatically means very little innovation.(c) Uncle Sams Wallet -Tomorrow a Chinese Tech Business needs money for R & D - It can raise say $ 200 Million in a month from Wall Street and Existing Chinese Businesses.A Japanese Businesses needs money for R & D - it can raise $ 500 Million in a week from 10 times the number of sources and investors.The US Government has the softest policies with Japan and the Harshest Policies with China(Its seriously admirable that even despite all that China has so many investors - taking the second spot to Japan in Asia)(d) A Larger Sense of Freedom -It evolved gradually and slowly. First the Samurai ruled the others like Artisans, Merchants and Eta - then gradually from 1876 - the roots of democracy started - selective democracy, then total democracy and today their people are ready for democracy. You dont have too much rabble or dregs in Japan.This means Japan is always everybodys friend while China is always an enemy to many people.Yet it is sure that American influence is huge in Japan. If America cuts off Japan - Japan will collapse. It has not protected its economy or currency from such a contingency.China on the other hand has adequate protections and once they begin to genuinely start Cryptocurrency - they will have an edge unlike anybody else.However that day is still around 10 years away.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-is-more-advanced-in-terms-of-technology-and-economy-Japan-or-China

Here’s why:Japan is old!I mean, there are a million factors that go into economic growth in any given quarter, and those will come along and rise and fall and whatever, but Japan has an overwhelming factor that makes economic growth very difficult, and that’s the aging population.Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world (the average person lives to 84 there) and one of the lowest fertility rates (less than 1.5 children per couple).

They were one of the first countries in the world to have a below-replacement fertility rate (first hitting that point in 1959). And their current fertility is actually an improvement, fertility got as low as 1.3 a couple of decades back,As a result of all of this, a third of the population of Japan is over the age of 60. Adult diapers are now outselling baby diapers in the country, which has never happened in any country in history. That means that the working age population is continually shrinking, while having to care for an ever-increasing population of retirees. Japan tends to resist allowing more immigrants in to bolster the workforce, so you have fewer and fewer workers trying to grow an economy with limited resources.There’s a number, in demographics, known as the “dependency ratio”, which is the ratio between people of working age (15 to 65) to the people outside of that age range. That ratio obviously isn’t the sole factor in economic growth, but it’s a pretty robust predictor of whether a country is capable of it. And Japan’s ratio is bad and only getting worse.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-is-more-advanced-in-terms-of-technology-and-economy-Japan-or-China

I would also take into account the mineral and energy resources available worldwide (and the fact that these are subject to a capitalist global system - not free) as these resources are needed to make the houses/food/energy/medicine that everyone needs.By removing the usual politicians emotional self interest and the affect of corruption etc it would be interesting to see what the supercomputer would come up with as the best solution to feed the entire worlds population, give them a roof over their head, usefully employ them etc and give everyone a reasonable life.I agree “a reasonable life is not a right” but having a crappy hungry dangerous life is not the default. I also agree with capitalism so there will be people at the top and people at the bottom but I am sure the bar at the bottom can be raised a helluva lot higher than it is today.I am 100% sure it would not come up with the sorry mess that we have as a global solution.Shame Bill Gates would spend a few of his billions on this.
