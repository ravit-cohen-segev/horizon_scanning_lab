Mellanox or Intel for NICs, Arista make good switches but there are alternatives.You’re going to need racks, and a lot of power, a power distribution setup of some kind, good cooling, and a suitable space to keep all this stuff.The machines themselves… well, browse through the SuperMicro, Dell, and HP server catalogs and you’ll get some idea.Plus of course, you need storage.

1,"During the initial days of my first year at IIT Kanpur, I used to have a batchmate with whom I played Badminton every evening. I used to win against him every single time, and he kept betting that he would win the next time. He was a very jovial guy, and a good Badminton player.One evening, after playing the game, he said we should play the next morning as well. Since we usually played only in the evenings, I was surprised that he wanted to wake up early in the morning to play, especially since we would have to rush for classes after the game.

I used to win against him every single time, and he kept betting that he would win the next time. He was a very jovial guy, and a good Badminton player.One evening, after playing the game, he said we should play the next morning as well. Since we usually played only in the evenings, I was surprised that he wanted to wake up early in the morning to play, especially since we would have to rush for classes after the game. He jovially said, “Why? You’re afraid you might lose if we play in the morning?”And so we played the next morning as well. That afternoon, he committed suicide by hanging himself in his room.It turned out he was depressed because of the increased academic pressure, and because of not being able to score well in his first semester. He decided to quit rather than be labelled as a failure. Surprisingly, that depression never showed up on his face ever. He always seemed happy.Sushant Singh Rajput’s loss has struck a chord with so many people because it is another indicator that depression is real. There are hundreds of theories revolving around on the cause of his depression. Maybe some of them are true. Maybe not. We would never really know for sure what was troubling him.You never know what a person is suffering through, as in most of the cases, depression never shows up on the face. Depression does not look at success or money. It just happens. It can happen to anybody.However, suicide is still never the solution. And you have the power to prevent that around you.Look out for your friends and family, for any early signs of depression. If you yourself are feeling sad about anything, talk to someone close to you. Vent it out - it always helps.If you see someone around you getting bullied or ill treated, stop that person. This applies not just to physical bullying, but also to online bullying. In a lot of scenarios, bullying is so subtle that it goes unnoticed. Stop that.If you see someone feeling depressed because of academic failures, relationships or any other failures, step up and support them in their phase. However tough the situation might look like, suicide is still never the solution.If someone around you does a good job, appreciate them. Even a small token of appreciation can lighten up someone’s mood.Stop comparing children on the basis of academic success. Stop comparing people on the basis of salaries. Stop comparing people.You have the power.",441 followers,Rohan Jain,4.9K,1.1K,50.5M,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-make-a-super-computer-by-using-only-PC-components

I was numb.But I thought that this pain will subside and I will be back to my happy mood after one or two days but nothing like that happened. His demise shook me and impacted me to a great extent. The more I read about him the more I started feeling guilty about the fact that why didn't I know so much about him when he was alive. Why did I admire other less deserving celebrities more than this gem who was right there in Bollywood working so hard to make his mark in the industry. I started feeling restless.What I also came to know that Bollywood was just an iota in his life. His interests were something else. Being an engineer I could relate to all those topics which he was so much intrigued in. He was so generous that he donated for Nagaland and Kerala floods, donated for a cancer patient kid and sent young talents to NASA.He once quoted James Dean at an award show,“Being a good actor isn't easy, being a man is even harder. I want to be both before I am done.He was both of them. A good actor and a good human being. He was also a bibliophile. He had a Twitter account by the name “The Book Club"" where he recommended some really good books.We lost a true gem and a legend.Rest in peace theI am also posting some of my favourite photos of him.❤🦋🌪💫🌈",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,2.5K,4.4K,123.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Sushant-Singh-Rajputs-loss-seem-to-be-a-personal-loss-to-us

10,"Suicide doesn’tI really admired Sushant Singh. After watchingSuicide doesn’tI really admired Sushant Singh. After watchingInInSushant came across as a very grounded, intelligent and hardworking man. He was originally suppose to be an engineer but decided to transition to becoming an actor. He doesn’t have any connections in the industry. So he had to work from square one, to get his feet into the door. He is a magnificent dancer. I’ve watched one interview of his and was astounded with the answer he gave to the reporter. He told the reporter, (I’m paraphrasing) “if you keep chasing after something, when you achieve it, momentarily you will be happy. Then you will sink into depression. So you keep trying to chase that high. But, if you love what you do, you will have those moments of high, while still enjoying day after day what you do.” I was speechless. These were such profound words, coming from a celebrity who has achieved so much success in his career. I was not expecting this level of wisdom from him.What makes this tragic was that it was merely a mask. You Google Sushant and you will find tons of pictures of him, dressed exceptionally and smiling. During his interviews he appears so proud of his achievement and hard work. His movies have been a success. Sushant transitioned from engineering student, to TV show actor to a full fledged movie star. There was an article that stated, Sushant refused a lucrative deal for a commercial that advertised skin whiting creams in order to enhance beauty. How many celebrities you know, sell out for money and promote a product that is damaging and cruel to their audience? Sushant couldn’t be bought. He understood the impact of these commercials and the message it sends to their audience, especially those who do not have fair skin. (Fair skin=beautiful. Dark skin=ugly.) He gave tons of his fans hope. Everyone loves to root for the underdog. What happens when the underdog gives up?Sushant lost his mother in 2003. He had four older sisters and he was the youngest child. He was in a six year relationship with his ex girlfriend, before the relationship ended. There has been speculation regarding the reasons why he committed suicide. He was given the cold shoulder by people in the industry. There would be elaborate parties and he would be intentionally excluded. His agent passed away on the 9th. Others say, maybe it was murder. What are the odds both he and his agent commit suicide so close to each other?I don’t know what happened. I saw an image circulating of the scene of his death. That’s an insult to his memory. The man died. His dying moment shouldn’t be publicly shared for the world to see. It’s an insult to his family who is hurting, seeking answers and suffering. I heard after his father heard the news, he passed out. He has been taken to the hospital and his health continues to deteriorate. No parent ever wants to see their child leave before them. The poor man lost his wife and now his only son. The impact of these two tragedies must be devastating.Sushant had demons. Demons we may never know about. He didn’t leave a suicide note. There has been updates stating that Sushant has been suffering from clinical depression for the past six months. We don’t know if he has been seeking help from a mental health professional. We know the man lost the battle. We don’t know what demons people are fighting behind closed doors. That smile we plaster onto our face when interacting with the world, can easily be faked.Remember Sushant. Remember all those we have lost to suicide. Remember these individuals who lived a life that had meaning and joy to everyone they interacted with. These lost individuals had family that loved them. Friends, lovers, classmates, coworkers, neighbors, etc.When someone be it family, friend, or even acquaintance comes to you and tells you “I’m not doing well. Can we talk?” Don’t brush them away. Don’t push them aside. You have no idea if this is a desperate attempt at reaching for help, or if that conversation will keep them away from the ledge. It’s hard to pinpoint depression. People that are suffering internally are skilled at hiding it. You won’t know unless they choose to discuss it with you. Always be willing to speak with people in need. You don’t know if you will get a second opportunity to do so.Remember Sushant. As there has been many that we have lost in the past to suicide. Committing suicide shouldn’t be the answer. Help others realize that.",801 followers,Debolina Santra,1K,60,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Sushant-Singh-Rajputs-loss-seem-to-be-a-personal-loss-to-us

He wasn’t some forgotten actor.His last movie, Dil Bechara was and is eagerly awaited by everyone.Every day, we are fighting for our dreams. There might arise a stage where someone might feel that they are done. That’s what happened to Sushant!But we should take his bucket list as our inspiration, not the negative aspects and get demotivated. Like him, I wish to support organic farming now.

They visit your school uninvited, they make everyone fall in love with them, hand out drugs and alcohol, play loud music, and offer everyone a place at their exclusive elite school where they teach you to be the best at only the thing you're good at. They literally have their court orders that they can't be within 1,000kms of a school and why made into their clothing, and they point out the most horrible things they've done to students that went with them, let alone those who refuse. Student get addicted and go with them just by being in the same hallway.Tzeentch:The guidance counselor. Whenever things go wrong they're right there, with advice on how to graduate sooner. The school keeps putting up posters telling you not to listen to the guidance counselor, they have no interest in your future, just in keeping the school running, and the advice puts you in terrible danger. The students who follow the advice get taught in a special classroom and most come out with mutations or like mindless shells of what they once were, but every so often a new guidance counselor that was a student emerges and they seem to have made a decent life for themselves. You end up following the advice even when you try not to.Adeptus Mechanicus:It's like they go to a different school in your school. They only learn trade skills. They're always covered in metal from their studies, or even have cuts with metal in them, and they don't seem to mind. You've never seen them get expelled but you have seen them dragged away to mental institutions. They only speak in jargon, and they're the ones rebuilding the school all the time. You don't know enough to tell them a classroom collapsing isn't adequate construction. You're certain they could make the school safe and run it properly, but they choose not to.",1 follower,Mark Stamp,636,3.2K,24.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Sushant-Singh-Rajputs-loss-seem-to-be-a-personal-loss-to-us

She doesn’t have a family and is socially awkward)...I had fun writing this answer. This is one of those answers where I had to think and properly arrange everything. At the same time, this was really challenging. Most of the characters are so diverse and they’re so much more than cliques. It was really challenging for some characters, like Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, Groot, Falcon… In the end, I couldn’t do ‘",27 followers,Lara Friedrichs,819,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Sushant-Singh-Rajputs-loss-seem-to-be-a-personal-loss-to-us
