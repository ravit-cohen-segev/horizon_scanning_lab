The middle class is vanishing— junk jobs are replacing well-paying careers, costs of living (rent, education, and healthcare) are skyrocketing, and social services, which help with these sorts of things, are being gutted.The result? Debt has become a staple in most American’s lives. What Americans used to finance through hard work at a regular ol’ job (paying for college, a car, health insurance) is now impossible without going into debt.So, you have one “half” of America which is essentially living pay check to pay check, using money they don’t have to buy essential goods, and working in companies where their CEO’s receive paychecks of up to 400x what they make.And then you have the other “half”— the comfortably wealthy— financiers, lawyers, executives, tech engineers, who pay out of pocket for all the expenses that burden the other side with debt and insecurity. This half physically separates themselves from the other, living in gated communities or distant suburbs. They send their kids to elite prep schools or suburban public schools, which are populated largely by other privileged kids— where they are trained to get into good colleges and, later, secure prestigious jobs.Also, the movie touches heavily on Automation, which essentially rendered the vast majority of people unemployable. A decent future government would guarantee these people universal basic income, but if we look at how the US has treated the welfare system over the last forty something years, it is definitely plausible that politicians wouldn’t fight for it. In the movie, the masses copped through joining gangs, scavenging, and getting by on odd jobs— seems oddly similar to how many people live in some cities in modern America.Ok— so the foundation of an Elysium like future is clearly there. But will this necessarily evolve into a world where all of the rich folks live in a giant space colony and blow up refugee shuttles? Eh. Maybe. But it seems obvious that the rich will continue to physically distance themselves from the poor in increasingly extravagant ways. Global warming might not make living on Earth a death sentence, but it will definitely make it more hazardous. The people best equipped to defend themselves against these dangers are those who are able to afford expensive safeguards to protect their homes and bodies. It is not ridiculous to conclude that, in a couple hundred years or so, people may start leaving Earth to live a safer life in orbit or on Mars.I’m not saying that this future is likely— I think that, if the global 1% were to try and horde 100% of the benefits of automation and deny UBI, there would be a massive resistance from voters. Assuming that America keeps its democratic institutions, there would be too much social pressure against this inequality (way more than what there is now), which would make this sort of dystopian future impossible.But again, there is a chance that this pressure never forms. Or maybe it does, and just gets subtly or violently suppressed (hopefully not by hard-ass police robots with stun batons)…","3,068 followers",Phillip Gabriel Alcantara Mercado,5.1K,631,19.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-probable-is-the-plot-of-Elysium-being-a-reality

While I do not believe in the existence of deity, it seems to me the universe lies and will always lie beyond the grasp of any intellectuals on earth, and the universe is just supposed to remain a mystery to the lives on earth.As a kid, while I marveled at the incredible observations by so many scientists of all times and the greatness of human minds, I was also appalled at how insignificant and transient human lives were on a grand scale. The sun in the sky, more than a million times bigger than the planet we are living on, is only one of the 300 billion in the Milky Way Galaxy, which is only one of billions of galaxies in the universe. In addition, multiverse theory proponents say there may even be multiple universes.Just as many questions — how life started on Earth, how mind works, and what the nature of time and consciousness is — philosophers and scientists have been grappling with for thousands of years, the universe is so inherently and profoundly complex that it will forever elude human understanding. Maybe the universe is meant to exist in a way that would never be understood completely.It is depressing to think that there are hard limits in human beings, and nothing demonstrates this better than space exploration.","4,001 followers",Paul Barends,1K,1.4K,10.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-probable-is-the-plot-of-Elysium-being-a-reality

There is a certain gap between the information industry of China and the United States, but it is not particularly large overall.The current Chinese shortcomings are mainly in chips, operating systems, industrial software and large-scale basic software. If the Chinese can integrate their domestic resources and make good use of talents and market advantages, breaking through these shortcomings will not take long.This kind of hegemonic behavior of the United States will certainly cause damage to China, but the Chinese can adopt advanced system design and achieve a high degree of coordination between software and hardware, which can greatly reduce the requirements for the American chips.The Chinese traditional information technology system does depend on the high performance of a single chip, and thus also on the high-end chip manufacturing process. For example, the large-scale business systems and production systems that currently occupy a monopoly position in the finance and telecommunications industries are all US ""IOE"" systems. It is composed of high-performance CPUs from IBM and Intel, Oracle large-scale database software and EMC high-end storage. Each system uses only a small amount (about tens to hundreds) of CPUs, so the performance of a single chip is very important. If the Chinese can’t get rid of the shackles of this traditional system, and they will be firmly stuck in the neck by the aforementioned sanctions by the United States on Chinese high tech companies like Huawei.Relying on the Chinese own existing core technology, chips with 14nm or 28nm technology can still be produced. Although 7nm and 5nm advanced process chips are not available in the short term, this can only affect the mobile phone business, because most technology products use 14nm and 28nm chips more than enough.Fortunately, under the guidance of autonomous independence and innovation ideas, Chinese scientific and technical personnels broke the shackles of traditional thinking and built an original Chinese system by using software to enhance hardware to achieve overall high performance, and it has been used in some key systems successfully in reality.The Chinese system also includes servers, databases and storage. The database software has original core technology, which can aggregate hundreds or thousands of low-end CPU chips into a larger and unified super computing power than American ""IOE"". This technology is unique to China, and there is no similar technology in foreign countries. For users, it is no difference from using traditional foreign systems, even running faster, but in fact the Chinese system uses a large number of low-end CPUs, including domestic CPU chips that use non-latest technology, or those old Intel chips from a few years ago.For example, in June of this year (2020), a Chinese service provider took the lead in using the Chinese system on a large-scale production system, replacing the traditional system of American minicomputers, Oracle databases and high-end storage with 12 old Intel chips from 2014. They replaced two imported minicomputers worth 10 million yuan in the project. The performance of the system did not decrease but increased. It processed tens of millions of transactions every day and has been operating normally for nearly 3 m...",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,9.1K,5.6K,426.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-probable-is-the-plot-of-Elysium-being-a-reality

All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement.Strong FormA good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement.StyleJust as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form.

One of these is the big question, the Theory of Everything. I can't prove it, but on the tip of my brain is the suspicion that this just needs some new, off-the-wall insight, by someone who is brilliant but simply doesn't know any better, that is, what they are supposed to think.Even apart form physics, there are still huge strides of basic insight to be made in other fields, such as Cognitive Science. We still don't have a way to build a device that does what nearly all humans do—process language properly. Part of this is Noam Chomsky's fault, but he's been out of the picture long enough. There are some pretty impressive people like George Lakoff, but they largely go unnoticed.As for the time period, that was all when the population was much smaller than it is now. More than half of the people on the planet were born after I was, and I'm still not very old. There have got to be geniuses out there.Before giving my hypothesis, let's look at the three you mentioned in chronological order.Faraday was almost completely uneducated. He was a brilliant tinkerer. He put on shows of things that went ""zap,"" and people noticed. There are still brilliant tinkerers. They put on demos. Who notices? Occasionally, you'll see a video on Facebook, but that's about it.Einstein was better educated, and his patent clerk job was because he knew something about physics and could evaluate patents. Still, he was a patent clerk. His first big paper, the one that started what would become the Theory of Special Relativity, was short and had no references. It wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in a blast furnace of being published today. An Einstein could ""publish"" on the Internet, but it would be lost in a sea of crackpottery, and nobody would notice.Feynman followed a more canonical path, but he was still weird as all weirdness. I can't help thinking that a Feynman today would be diagnosed and medicated long before his brain had a chance to flower.My hypothesis is that Einstein had it right when he said, ""It is almost a miracle that modern teaching methods have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for what this delicate little plant needs more than anything, besides stimulation, is freedom."" Only it's much worse.Education is Big Business, Universities especially so. They are all about shunting people along this or that approved track to get the desired result. There's all sorts of talk about role models and the like. If there is oneIf that doesn't ruin you, the Big Business that is called Big Business does. I have some indirect personal experience with that. The two greats in one of my fields were Jim Blinn and Jim Kajiya. Kajiya was one of the two independent developers of the rendering equation, the grand unified theory of computer graphics. Blinn had an entourage and groupies who followed him everywhere. But then Hollywood started noticing computer graphics and corporatized it. Kajiya went to work at Microsoft and was never heard from again. He got Blinn to join him. No more entourage, no more interesting stuff, no more groupies. I went to see Blinn talk at San Antonio. The room was packed because of his reputation. The talk was, perhaps, a bit interesting in an esoteric way.There are still geniuses. I count Linus Torvalds as one, even though Linux is a copy of something else. But like all geniuses, he took a radical left turn somewhere along the way, and everything is carefully designed by some very smart people to prevent that from happening.So I'd say ""yes."" Research has lost its sight. Maybe it always had, and people got through by accident due to incompetence at keeping everyone out, but those days are largely gone.If you want to find the scientists of the future, look at the kids who are doing weird things with LEGO blocks and vinegar and get to them before they get chewed up and digested by a system well designed to produce, in Frank Zappa's words, loyal plastic robots for a world that doesn't care.We also would have to do something about economics if we want to fix it.

These people then form an incestuous circle, discussing the same three topics again and again, without conspiracy, just because this is what they know, and this is all that the public hears about, and they publicizing a few people endlessly at the expense of all others.Einstein understood the centralized mass media, and he was good at manipulating it, and at becoming a star. Uncharacteristically for a scientist, and despite his social isolation, he had very strong political skills. In the 1910s, he was famous among Berlin University students for his outspoken pacifism, more than for his science. He was offered the presidency of Israel. He made a much better media figure than other physics stars, like Dirac, who didn't talk, or Schrodinger, who openly had two wives, or Heisenberg, who was a geek's geek, or Bohr, who mumbled unclearly, or Pauli, who was an asshole. Einstein always had a pithy quote, and always exuded good humor.The monopolized media needs exactly one great figure, and in Einstein's case, they accidentally happened to stumble on the best guy. They hardly ever do, so one should be grateful when it happens. It's because the guy who was most media-savvy also, by a fortuitous coincidence, happened to be the guy with the most earth-shattering science. If Einstein were a one legged foul-mouthed sex-offender, we would probably be celebrating 100 years of Poincare's special relativity, Planck's E=mc^2, Hilbert's revolutionary theory of gravity, the Smoulochowski fluctuation/dissipation relation, Compton and Millikan's bold photon hypothesis of 1919, Leo Szillard's letter to Roosevelt. This kind of crap happened in Germany when Einstein was politically out.Today, the media environment accomodates a much larger number of people, and allows a fair distribution of credit to the people who actually deserve it. The funny thing about Einstein and Feynman, is that they come out looking good, they deserve it.

I would put Steven Hawking over Feynman because Hawking had the same kind of pop-culture fame as Einstein.We have reached an information singularity! Everything that is easy has already been done. No longer can you attach your name to an equation in an egotistical manner for simple things like 16th century mathematicians did. Granted you still had to be white to do even that.. lol.So those people got more impact for discovering minor things. Today it is the opposite. No one can have the same impact as people before the internet or hundreds of years ago did. Today even if you do 10x or 100x what Einstein did, you still won’t become as impactful, famous or a cultural icon. After all, when it comes down to it, that’s what everyone is really after. Some sort of fame or cultural icon status like Einstein who was in essence a rock star!So the bottom line is that impact is not what it seems to be but it is subjective. One can argue that if you come up with something really original, the world will recognize it. No.. most likely it will not. Have you ever witnessed this phenomenon?He gets recognized more than you! That’s the world. So recognition is provided for convenience more than anything else. It is like winning a Grammy. If they don’t have anyone in the rock category, they will find the act that closest fits that category and give the rock award to that person, even though that act might not even be rock. Science is the same way, recognition usually goes to the convenient not necessarily the deserving.Most smart people will not get the recognition as Euler or Gauss because nothing can really cause an impact that would change the world at this point. You’d literally have to invent a time machine. It has to be something that extraordinary. But science is not alone, almost every field is in the same boat.All of these things essentially died after the internet came along because today everybody is a star. That is the mantra of social media. So if you have some profound theory, you could self publish that yourself. You no longer have to wait for it to be accepted by a group of PHDs. This actually creates confusion and saturation because everybody has content to share and today everything is essentially ‘content’. Even if you publish a peer reviewed paper, that is content just like social media content.So no one can have that impact that people before the internet did. Today everything is saturated and we have more participants than spectators. Back then you had more spectators; that is, not everybody tried to do everything. Today due to the internet, anyone can learn to play the guitar or sing or do just about anything. So no matter what field you choose, there is saturation; that is, there are 100s, 1000s, 10,000s of people that are good and you got to compete with all of them to get recognition. A single job at Cisco gets 600 applications, you can’t even stand out there and get a job, how in the hell are you going to stand out for most normal things in life where you are competing with something like 100,000 people?The other thing is crab mentality in the sense that people are so desperate for recognition where ever it may be (science, rock star, movie star, etc) that even if you do something completely original, people will steal your ideas and just present them as their own. In the simplest sense, after I write these somewhat controversial answers, I end up reading all the ideas I have stated being rehashed by other people. lol. So that’s the world we live in today. There is an excess of information and everybody wants recognition and they will do anything to get it. No community, science or otherwise can survive this.Finally, most big discoveries and inventions are done by big corporations that have 100s of scientists, so the concept of the lone wolf scientist who uplifts humanity all by himself is dead today. It may actually be that it never happened that way; that is, people always stood on the shoulders of giants but due to politics and convenience, they were allowed to take the credit. Today that can’t happen, the concept of the Lone Wolf Scientist is dead.

""WE WANT WELL ROUNDED STUDENTS"". It doesn't matter if you are genius or not, you will be rejected to those universities because you are not well rounded. You see, if you are interested in science and want to dedicate your life to it, you don't have time to be well rounded. You don't have time to do 20+ extracurricular. You don't have the time to sit and chat with teachers just so they can give you glowing recommendation. Einstein made fun of his teachers and humiliated them a lot of times because he didn't care about recommendations etc. I am not saying that you do no require extra curricular but one of two should suffice. Einstein like playing the violin and sailing(if I remember correctly). From our early days, we are doing things which are uninteresting just so we can be well rounded...If you are doing 20+ activities just so you can make it into a resume then you are doing it wrong. Many people cannot match with Einstein or other great personalities is because they are going into the wrong direction from the start. We are taught in childhood that we should study so that we can land high paying jobs. That is why people kill their passion and talent and chase money. If you remember this quote by Einstein ""Everybody is a genius. If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, the fish will whole life think it is stupid."" Basically, a fish will flourish in water, a lion will flourish in forest, animals will flourish in their set environment. Lets say that you are a fish chasing after money and money is in the forest environment. You might just survive but you will not flourish there. That is a problem that lots of people are facing and failing just because ""They are just not good enough"".There is also some societies where if you are not an engineer then you are a failure. Lets say I was an artist and I flourish in the marshy environment currently. Engineering is in the ocean environment. I will survive the ocean but I will not be good at it. Technology is also playing a part into degrading the brain and making them more lazy. ""I don't want to study, I want to play clash of clans"". When I was a kid, I used to play chess and solve puzzles and brain teasers and these days, my cousin is playing clash of clans.
