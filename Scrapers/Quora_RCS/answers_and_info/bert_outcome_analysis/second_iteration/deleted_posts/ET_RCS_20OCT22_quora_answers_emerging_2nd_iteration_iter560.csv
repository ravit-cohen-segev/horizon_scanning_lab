Think of it like this: if you wish to travel forward one kilometer, you can transition to hyperspace, travel forward one centimeter, drop out of hyperspace, and you will emerge one kilometer from where you began.Objects in normal space project a gravity “shadow” into hyperspace, and an object in hyperspace passingIt’s like driving through an obstacle course not being able to see fifty feet in front of you in a car that only has two speeds: fast and stop. Obviously that’s fine as long as you travel along routes you already know are clear of obstacles, which is all a hyperspace lane is: a clear route through hyperspace that has been well charted. If you travelTravel without the use of hyperspace lanes is a major obstacle in Timothy Zahn’s new Thrawn books, according to which most of the Unknown Regions is too unstable for stable hyperspace lanes to form. As a result, people must travel through hyperspace “jump by jump,” unless they can secure the services of a Force-sensitive navigator who can see further ahead into hyperspace than instruments can and thus steer the ship through a continuous path improvised on the fly.",215 followers,Glenn Rittenhouse,1.6K,2.2K,2.3M,https://www.quora.com/Are-Star-Wars-ships-limited-to-hyperspace-lanes

I think. the idea is that you can only come out of and jump into hyperspace on a certain point near the planet. Theoretically, you could just do a random jump, but you’ll probably die without knowing it, as your remains are scattered across the cosmos in a fine mist, or incinerated by a random star.

It also explains why there is no relative velocity when you drop out of hyperspace. You weren’t really going that fast.This also explains Han’s quote from the original movie, where he brags about making the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs. Parsecs, as we know, are units of distance not time. He was bragging about his elegant astrogation to plot the shortest, but likely most dangerous path in hyperspace.edit: This is also is why they take R2 droids and the like along with them in fighters. They are Astromech droids, and their function is to do those long calculations for cross dimensional trips.

Clearly this might exclude nations so caught up in their own cultural trifles, but no time to worry about them.At which point I think we go STEM education all the way.I like some of the other ideas, particularlyI think the only way we are going to succeed at saving a sizable percentage of the population is to build some form of aThis project would have to occur along the equator to gain the full advantage of the geosynchronous satellite, which limits the facilities locations to being in South America, Africa and Indonesia. In general, Europe and Africa would focus their efforts on the African space elevators, the far east and Australia/New Zealand areas would focus their efforts on the Indonesian space elevators and North and South America would focus their efforts on the South American Space Elevators.Projects should probably proceed in parallel on sites chosen for maximum stability and minimum weather variance. Regarding weather, wind turbine should be placed near each site so that weather variance can be offset ny active stabilization coming from the power generated by the turbines. The Indonesian Stations should probably also be running tidal power systems.In regards to power systems, with the earth doomed, Nuclear power needs to get a stronger green light for earth's quick sprint to the finish line, and environment concerns that have more than a 50 year horizon should be abandoned in favor of powering the construction of the initial space elevators, and ultimately the full space stations.Inflatable structures should be used around the elevators to enable the building of massive protective zones around the space elevator cables. By having the structures be pressurized, rather than free standing, the material needs would be greatly reduced, and the potential sizes of the structures greatly increased.All (or as close to all as geo-politics allows) money formerly devoted to defense should be devoted to gearing up the R&D efforts.World Fusion efforts should declassify and combine forces.Genetic engineering should proceed with the goal of vastly improving the economies.The idea of keeping primitive people in the dark should be abandoned, and people who are trained as missionaries should be purposed to let these indigenous populations know that this world is going to end.Computer resources should be devoted to materials science and advanced molecular self-manufacturing, along the scales of automation that trees do naturally now. The idea is that we keep the elevators sending material up constantly, and the Geosynchronous outpost would be a location of non-stop materials assembly into space station structures.The idea of finding another habitable planet will be put on hold, for now. The arks (yes, more than one, many more) will instead need to be designed to be a permanent homes, but built on scales like we've never before imagined. As a result, a whole set of research projects that need to be spearheaded on earth aimed at producing permanently habitable space stations.And this is along with the research we need to do to get the space elevators off the ground (literally)And there will need to be re-engineering and organized on massive scales.*** After-thought addendum - The space arks themselves ***Several people answered about the need to find a new world, later. I'm going to contend that a set of arks, well-built, would be a better permanent residence, once fusion power was mastered, than earth itself is. So I think the plan isn't an ark, but a new, space-faring way of living in which we build enormous space stations, building the original scaffolds, and seeds, from materials lifted from earth, but filling out the space stations, possibly even after the impact destroys earth, from the materials available in the asteroid belt.So the concept is that these structures will, ultimately, be massive, on a scale that would eventually give us more usable land and ocean mass than the earth does now.So how do we build them? The same research I mentioned above into inflatable materials to build super-massive earth structures would also apply to the scaffolds used to build the space stations. The idea of using inflatable superstructures to build the early scaffolding of the space structures would greatly simplify a lot of the material requirements. This would facilitate the building of enormous superstructures on the ground while requiring minimal material. These structures could be rolled up like a bicycle inner tube, highly compact pre-inflation. And then inflated, once they in place up at the geosynchronous satellite. And since that satellite will be above the 23,000 mile basic orbit, they can use minimal active prolusion to be set free, slingshot like, off to the asteroid belt though carefully aimed to specific locations.As to how much air is needed, we live on the 21% partial pressure of oxygen. Plants don't do much with the nitrogen in the air (which is 78%) mainly just using the 1% CO2. One big savings would be to reduce the air pressure of structure from the sea level pressure here on earth, to 22%. This would reduce the tensile strength requirements of the scaffolding materials to handling 4 lbs per square inch rather than 15 in the non-weight bearing portions.With early successes at building super-massive superstructures, we could mine much of the material needed from the asteroid belt, rather than from the earth itself. And that could also act as a fall back plan should the space elevator approach fail some critical physical or technological limitation, that is, the building of massive inflatable super-structures that will act as scaffolds to be built up from the more gravitationally available material in the asteroid belt, might help to give us both super large, space cannons, and hyper-light rocketry.Ultimately, with the asteroid belt's material at our command, we could have many independent O'Neil cylinders that would have, in total, far more surface area to walk on than the earth has now. However, instead of walking in a situation where between yourself and the center of earth was 35000 miles of planetary layers, you'd be walking on a self-repairing (thanks to the Tree-like nanotechnology) floor that separated you from outer space by about 100 feet of material, the last 5 feet of which would contain the hydrogel like material Nasa researched for making meteorite impacts non-destructive (see comments).The interesting aspect is that, once this is underway, and we've began to master fusion, we could begin to be independent even of the sun itself, meaning we'd be well positioned to survive whatever happens to the solar system.A couple of points on power. An enormous amour of power, now, is used to generate light a night, heat when it's cold, and cold when it's warm. And a lot of our caloric needs come from fighting gravity, keeping warm, and breathing. Breathing in a 22% pressure, pure oxygen environment, and running at below earth's gravity levels might greatly reduce our initial needs while we master our new homes.*** end of addendum ***While this seems daunting, possibly far fetched, I have always been amazed at the speed with which World War II galvanized so many nations to achieve such amazing things, unfortunately for such a decidedly destructive purpose.And what the US was able to do in the 1960s, culminating with landing someone on the moon in an era when pocket calculators were out of the reach of the ordinary person, and computers were owned only by large companies, governments and universities.I actually think we could pull this off, if we had to, and save almost all of the able bodied people around the world.The Manhattan Project happened in a couple of years. The US space race in only 10, and this with technology and world-wide communication abilities that would embarrass a middle-schooler.And there will be a huge freeing up of resources if we don't have to be so much in fear of each other. I've always thought that the biggest impediment to our success in the world is that we've organized so much of it so that it is man verses man, and so little that it is man verses nature.I'm glad we don't have to do this, because there's a lot of great non-STEM things going on in the world, and war time economies are not fun. But I think it's something we could do if we had to. That's what we're really good at, as a species, doing what absolutely positively must be done, when we are given no other choice.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Are-Star-Wars-ships-limited-to-hyperspace-lanes

The Ark Ship has to WORK for the duration of the voyage. Not just the physical aspects of the propulsion (you have to slow down when you get there), navigation (you have to make course corrections to get to the planet specifically), and life support, but also the social, political and economic structures which the people on board will have to live their multiple generations.Given the types of propulsion technology we could reasonably expect to achieve in 40-50 years, we are looking at a journey time in excess of 100,000 years. For comparison, the entire history of human civilization from the discovery of farming is 12,000 years give or take a few centuries.And you cannot plausibly expect anyone to be able to successfully design and build, in just 50 years, a complex system with maintenance contingencies that must function for a time period substantially longer than human civilization has itself existed. We simply wouldn't even have the context required to even try to plan for contingencies that only become likely after 20-30,000 year when we have no experience or record of civilized system enduring for more than a few thousand.Thus generation Ark ships to other stars only become plausible when propulsion technologies can cut down travel time to several thousand years at the longest, not tens of thousands of years, and in 50 years that's not happening, barring the aforementioned unforeseen miracle breakthrough.So tootling around the Solar System for several thousand years, possible. Leaving the sun's domain for another star, no.With that in mind, if we cannot deflect the asteroid, I think our best and most plausible chance is to simply put as many Ark Ships as we can into earth orbit.Unless this is a truly monster asteroid, the earth will recover from the impact faster than it would take for a generation ship to reach the nearest potentially habitable star system. And repairing an asteroid-damaged Earth back to a level where human survival is possible on the surface will likely be easier than terraforming Mars or Venus to a similar level.Staying in earth orbit means we don't have to spend time or resources building an interstellar drive system. Which means we can build more Arks, perhaps bigger Arks, and faster. It also means our life support systems on the Arks don't have to be absolutely 100% perfect, because resupplying raw materials from earth remains an option. Staying at 1AU means you don't need to absolutely require figuring out fusion, as you can use solar power.So, get off the planet, wait out the storm, then rebuild and resettle.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

I came up with an approach that computed a character distribution histogram for every string: you take a 64-bit field, split it up into 16 sets of 4 bits, and then compute the number of characters that are X modulo 16 for X = 0...15. For example, in the string ""hello"", the ASCII values of characters are 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, which are 8, 5, 12, 12, 15 modulo 16. In a 64-bit field, ""hello"" would thus correspond to a 0001 in the 9th, 6th, and 16th sets of 4 bits, a 0010 in the 13th set, and a 0000 in every other set of 4 bits. In the end, every string I had boiled down to a single 64-bit histogram.After computing these histograms for every string in the dictionary, I could compare them to the histogram of the search string and use bit arithmetic to quickly determine a lower bound on the edit distance. For example, if one string has 5 letters that are 3 mod 16 and 0 letters that are 4 mod 16, and another string has 0 letters that are 3 mod 16 and 5 letters that are 4 mod 16, then their edit distance will be at least 5 (i.e. it takes 5 edit edit operations if you replace 'aaaaa' with 'bbbbb'). Because the lower bound was almost always much higher than the distance threshold I was interested in, I could avoid the full Levenshtein distance computation about 99.99% of the time. As a result, I could do my edit distance check against an entire 1m item dictionary in milliseconds, which was very acceptable for the use case I was working on.","12,130 followers",Leo Polovets,4.1K,481,6.2M,https://www.quora.com/Are-Star-Wars-ships-limited-to-hyperspace-lanes

Here's an opportunity to exercise my story telling. Let's see how I do. There is some computer science in this story described at an intuitive level. If you don't skip those parts, it will help to understand what a ""graph"" is in computer science.Since most roads in the hierarchy are minor roads, route calculation algorithms used in the industry were made much faster by not considering most of those roads in the calculation.But there was a problem. How could the reach of each node be computed efficiently? It could be computed by computing optimum routes for every possible pair of origins and destinations for each version of a road map, but for maintenance of a road map of the United States, that would be too expensive.Mission Peak:So I coded it up, the computation of reach bounds and the route calculations using reach bounds. My tests convinced me that it would work well. Then I became convinced that I had something interesting both in the academic world and in the industry. I had never even submitted an academic paper to an academic journal or conference, but I decided I'd try. I found a conference on algorithms called Alenex, learned the procedures for preparing an academic publication, wrote it carefully following academic standards and conventions as well as I could with proofs and some pseudo-code, had a co-worker review it, and submitted it to Alenex for formal review. It was accepted and I flew to New Orleans in January 2004 to present it. Reach-based routing had been invented and presented to the world, and it brought together methods from industry and academia.The power point slides in this story are from my talk at Alenex.http://www.siam.org/meetings/alenex04/abstacts/rgutman1.pdfI later realized that as pure as academia might be, being an academic gives one a little advantage, being a little more savvy about marketing one's own work.Dmitry asked in a comment (below) how this invention advanced my career. There is no clear answer but it's such a good question that I'll expand my story right here.I had only recently joined a team at Yahoo at the time I made the presentation at Alenex. In my four years at Yahoo, I’ll say that the answer is no, my paper did not advance my career at Yahoo.After a few years at Yahoo, I had a chance to move my career in a new direction and believed that my paper would help. I was put in contact with a senior scientist in a research organization with Yahoo. I thought that moving into research might be a good career move for me. I thought that my paper might compensate for my lack of a PhD (I have only an MS in computer science from UC Berkeley) to gain admission to research.Being an architect however is not an easy role - more responsibility than authority - so a talent for persuasion is needed. I sometimes blame myself for making another mistake, something like confirmation bias. I felt that reach-based routing should be used to solve a harder problem in which the map data is very dynamic. Certainly, it was very hard to resist building on previous investments based on my unique understanding of concepts in reach-based routing. I was given the chance to try it with Telenav's research team in Beijing. The results of that research were not considered good enough to continue forward. A diagnosis of the technical shortcoming was not simple, but I have thought about my proposal as a mistake because I believe I lost credibility. I should not have proposed something as speculative as I that.Location of Telenav office that I visited in Beijing:So although the answer is mixed, I can summarize by saying that my paper advanced my career only a little and not always in useful directions, some of which is my own fault.I always want to thank my boss at Wavemarket, Scott Hotes, for giving me the opportunity to invent reach-based routing.","1,447 followers",Bhavik Dhandhalya,782,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Are-Star-Wars-ships-limited-to-hyperspace-lanes

I didn’t know anything about cryptography at that time, so I just put the name of the ciphers in brackets (I wasn’t putting it into work yet, had to find a way to use this awesome tool.

But it really had it’s strength.In memory of this first three hours of glory of mine, that bound me forever to this wonderful machine, I did rewrite some of the ideas I was coding back at that time in Assembly.

You only have to try it. And believe in yourself. They all just cook with water and cover their stuff with important words. But the ideas - are mostly not that big. Yet.

It has at least three ways of trying to get itself to run. If one way doesn’t work, it tries another. At least two of these methods to launch itself were completely new then, and both of them used two independent, secret bugs in Windows that no one else knew about, until this worm came along.Once the worm runs itself on a PC, it tries to get administrator access on that PC. It doesn’t mind if there’s antivirus software installed — the worm can sneak around most antivirus software. Then, based on the version of Windows it’s running on, the worm will try one of two previously unknown methods of getting that administrator access on that PC. Until this worm was released, no one knew about these secret bugs in Windows either.At this point, the worm is now able to cover its tracks by getting underneath the operating system, so that no antivirus software can detect that it exists.

The specific motors it searches for are called variable-frequency drives. They’re used for running industrial centrifuges.

Go to Fry’s or Best Buy today and try to find a desktop not running Windows. Google has to buy shelf space for their ChromeOS products.Windows' dominance is tautological - it is ubiquitous because it always has been.Back when PCs were still relatively new to the consumer market and super modular (the 90s) the biggest expense for building your aunt a new PC would be the Windows license. But as the question states, “Here ya go, Aunt Betty! Gee, $50? Thanks!Linux's learning curve is virtually identical to Windows. But it is virus free. And cost free. And all software is free. There are a LOT of reasons to give Aunt Betty Ubuntu, and if it were her first PC, she would have no idea the difference!By allowing private users to get access to Windows for free means software makers would be choosing between selling to the all-free Ubuntu market or the supposedly paid-for Windows market which isIf you give away 10,000 $10 rewards cards on a busy street corner you can tell businesses ‘We have over 10,000 cardholders in this town alone!’ The businesses will buy in. It ain’t honest, it’s business. And it worked.Clarification: If you give the cards away or allow people to share their rewards card, you have retained the value of the cards. If you reduce the price to $0 you have eliminated the perceived value of the card. Piracy lets them access a larger market without losing the perceived value set by their price.Piracy worked for Windows. Bill Gates’ fortune comes from piracy as much as anything else.But you should always buy a license when you are able. It supports the businesses you love and encourages them to keep making great products.10k Upvote Edit: SecurityOne of the big dangers around pirating an Operating System is that your security may be out of date.

My smart anti-Microsoft classmate [who now works for Google] would remark that while IBM has to spend money on DVDs and free training, Microsoft doesn't even have to spend on DVD cost and training, for the same outcome. The pirates do that job - helping Microsoft get something that other companies spend a lot of money on. Why should Microsoft be angry with that?",2 followers,David Lago,1.7K,90,589.1K,https://www.quora.com/Are-Star-Wars-ships-limited-to-hyperspace-lanes

These people do not represent lost sales because they were never going to buy the product anyway.Edit: Roman Lee [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Roman-Lee ] wrote this in a comment, and it's so good I want to include it in the answer:> From my working experience, MS is no longer targeting the CD/DVD factories in China.

The less users of Windows out there (paying or pirate), the less will be the size of ecosystem.Ecosystem makes or breaks software.And you can’t make ecosystems by yelling ‘Developers’ and running from one end of a podium to another, or by paying money. You need millions and millions of users and legions of developers being attracted to that software due to the number of users.So, as Jeff Raikes states, its much better for Microsoft to let people pirate their software and use it, since it will not only make paying users out of many of you, but also you will also enlarge Windows ecosystem.If Microsoft pursued their copyright more vigorously, those millions of users could have done something Microsoft really, really, doesn’t want - migrate to another O/S.

It’s called the ‘strange-face-in-the-mirror’ illusion (bit of a mouthful, I know).You turn off all the lights in your room except for a dimly lit candle or lamp. Then, you pull up a chair and sit in front of a large mirror.The visual illusion is easy. All you have to do is stare at yourself for around ten minutes, without removing your gaze from the mirror, and ensuring you pick a point to focus on. You can see the effects taking place even after about a minute or so of doing this.What starts to happen is that your face distorts and morphs, and after a while, a lot of people start to see unpleasant, disturbing, and often frightening images.The results, to say the least, are simultaenously intriguing and terrifying.The initial experiment involved fifty people, who all did exactly as what is outlined above.After doing so, the participants began to see strange distortions in their reflection:(These don’t add up to 100% given that these patients are able to see multiple different things - the distortion is ongoing.)The study in general noted that:‘Apparition of monstrous beings produced fear or disturbance. Dynamic deformations of new faces (like pulsations or shrinking, smiling or grinding) produced an overall sense of inquietude for things out of control.’So for what reason does this potentially frightening experience occur?A few articles have stated it’s because of the Troxler effect, which basically is where the brain selects important information and influences our perception. Take this pretty famous example, the Lilac Chaser:If you stare at the cross in the centre for a few seconds, the pink dots will start to disappear.This is because brain classifies them as irrelevant. But the green dot (which does not exist, but is rather another illusion of colour created by the brain) however, is moving, and thus important - so you can still see it, even though you can’t see the others.To supposedly lessen the processing burden on itself, the brain removes its attention from the less important information - from the feeling of our tongue resting on our mouth to the way our clothes feel on our skin.According to these articles, the same thing happens when you’re staring into the mirror. Your brain supposedly gets ‘bored’ because of a lack of stimuli.A participant commented:At one point it looked like something black slithered across the floor behind me (I can’t explain that one).The creepiest moment however, was when my eye (and I swear this happened), looked away and then looked back at me.It appears to be quite a scary phenomenon, although again, the results vary greatly from person to person - although it’s safe to say it leaves most feeling extremely uncomfortable.Regardless of its explanations, it’s something anyone can do - although I really wouldn’t recommend it. It can be a very disturbing experience and I’d advise against it.It’s honestly quite frightening what the brain can get up to when it’s got nothing better to do.If there’s something to take away from this, it’s that it’s probably best to avoid staring into the bathroom mirror at 3am chanting ‘Bloody Mary’.","1,713 followers",Ambica Koul,17.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Are-Star-Wars-ships-limited-to-hyperspace-lanes

It seemed to staff as if Oscar were trying to comfort and provide company to people as they died.Joan Teno, a physician at Steere House, clarified that ""it's not that the cat is consistently there first. But the cat always does manage to make an appearance, and it always seems to be in the last two hours.""After Oscar accurately predicted 25 deaths, staff started calling family members of residents as soon as they discovered him sleeping next to someone in order to notify them and give them an opportunity to say goodbye before the impending death.As of January 2010, Oscar had accurately predicted approximately 50 patients' deaths.I don’t know about you, but this absolutely freaks me out.

For instance, most germs get filtered by mucus in our nose. But Naegleria Fowleri manages to escape.Then it may stumble upon the olfactory nerve cells in your nose. These lead to olfactory bulb. There is a chemical in this area that helps in smelling named acetylcholine.The amoeba can smell this. It enters the olfactory tissue. Here is where a few immune cells attack the amoeba. It usually gets killed. But sometimes it doesn’t get killed. Then tracing the chemical, the amoebaThere it begins to attack the brain cells, and tear apart brain cells for the chemical. It begins to devour brain cells and the chemical. Amoeba multiplies.This is when the other immune cells attack the amoeba. But, while killing the amoeba, they even damage the brain cells.A battle which causes destruction begins. Till now, there is no kind of effect on the victim. But now, this increases body temperature like during fever, but this just makes things worse since Naegleria Fowleri thrives in hotter bodies.Stuff gets worse now. It all starts with headache, nausea etc. Then you get hallucinations, confusion, etc.Soon, the brain swells, but due to bones stopping it to swell further, there is lack of space, and the expansion causes medulla(brain stem) to rupture.This, leads to the death of victims.Within a week after infection, there is death.Survival from this is quite very rare. In most reported cases, the patient dies.But the lucky part is that, this infection is very, very rare. And for the amoeba itself to reach our body, needs to be splashed far up the nasal cavity. Then again, near olfactory tissue, it needs to escape the immune cells guarding, which is a difficult task. They rip apart amoeba and eat it, or use chemicals to kill it.It is quite rare, but due to the increasing water temperatures around globe, cases of this might increase.",63 followers,Lindsay Elizabeth,11K,174,31.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

In our own area, our own group, there could be entire galaxies that go unnoticed by us, invisible.Some of the larger clusters can contain hundreds of galaxies.The Virgo Supercluster is one of these.Spanning 110 million light years, it holds about a hundred galaxy clusters, like our own local group.Then there’s the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, comprised of about 60 superclusters of galaxies.About 1.37 billion light years across, it holds around a tenth of the observable universe.If all the grains of sand, from every beach, every desert, everywhere on Earth were equivalent to the universe, Earth would not even be 1 single grain of sand.93 billion light years across, and housing an estimated 10-billion superclusters, this is the observable universe.We are not even ants in the scheme of things.We are small, microscopic, infinitesimal.Analogies fail here; it is difficult to even attempt to wrap our heads around how tiny our planet is.We are impossibly small, impossibly trivial.Isn’t it scary?",71 followers,Phillip Raihan,6.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

His notorious experiments on patients are shocking, the darkest of which he executed at hospital's bell tower.Karma eventually caught up with the wicked doctor. Eventually, he lost his mind and climbed to the top of the bell tower and flung himself to his death below.4.Many believe that hundreds of thousands of tormented souls still remain trapped on Poveglia Island. A sense of sorrow and suffering continues to permeate from the island to this day.In fact, it has even been said that you can still hear their screams.5.One thing visitors report experiencing is the sensation of being watched. Others report being scratched and pushed by invisible forces.Some entities have even been said to push visitors into walls or chase them down corridors.6.With more than 100,000 plague victims and mental patients buried on the small island of Poveglia, it is no surprise that human bones continue to wash up on its shores.7.Locals to this day claim that the demented doctor’s spirit is still in the tower and will remain there forever and that on a quiet night, if you are listening closely, you can hear him ring the tower bell.8.Years after Poveglia Island's mental hospital was shut down, a family decided to purchase the island, intending to build a private holiday home there. The very first night was filled with such horrors that within hours the family fled, never to return.They reported that their daughter's face was nearly ripped off by an angry resident entity.9.Amid the numerous reports from illegal visitors is the story of a curiosity thrill-seeker who went to Poveglia with a group of friends. Upon entering the abandoned mental hospital, the illegal tourist reported a heavy sense of dread descend around them, followed by a deep voice that warned:""Leave immediately and do not return."" The visitors immediately complied.10.

We loose skin on a daily basis.4. Wow! This is so interesting to us. We’d be curious to know what our own belly button fingerprint says about us!5. Scaphism was a form of ancient torture back in the day. It consisted of the victim being covered all over with honey and then subjected to large amounts of ants and other insects.6. Back in 1888, there was a brutal murder taking place in London. Now known as The Whitehall Mystery. A young woman was dismembered and her body parts were scattered across the city in different locations. The murder was never solved.7. While filming the movie ‘The Exorcist’, many actors got injured, the set burned down, a Priest was brought in several times to bless the set, and the actor who played Burke, Jack MacGowran, died of Influenza.8. In the Czech Republic, there is a church called The Sedlec Ossuary that has decorations made entirely of human bones. This happened because there were too many people in the cemetery to bury everyone, and the church leaders claimed that if their bones became part of the church, it only made them closer to God. Nice propaganda spin there, guys.9. In New York City, more people commit suicide than are murdered.10. Sharks kill about 12 people a year. People kill about 11, 417 sharks—an hour.11. Back in the 1960s, the skeletons in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland were real. At the time, they thought that fake skeletons didn’t look scary enough. So they contacted the UCLA medical department and bought loads of skeletons that were usually used in anatomy classrooms. As time went on, fake skeletons started to look more convincing. Disney claims that they gave the real skeletons proper burials, but many speculate that there could be at least a couple real ones left over on the ride.12. Do you ever wonder what people did before the invention of assembly-line cups and bowls? In ancient England, people used the tops of hollowed human skulls to drink and eat.13. Hundreds of years ago, when people died on the battlefield or elsewhere outside, their bodies often just lay there until they rotted away. As they decompose, their skulls would start to grow a moss called usnea. People believed that this moss contained the spiritual qualities of the fallen soldiers, and they would gather it up as medicine. Apparently, usnea that grew on hanged men’s skulls was seen as the most effective.14. At Harvard University, there is a book bound in human skin.15. Psycho is the first American film to show a toilet on screen. It's also the first American film in which we hear a toilet being flushed. (That's just how repressed Americans were in the 1950s.)16. Ed and Lorraine Warren actually investigated the paranormal, and The Conjuring is an adaptation of the Warrens’ experiences with the Perron family and their supposedly haunted farmhouse.17. Actress Virginia Madsen was really hypnotized for some scenes so that her trance could look authentic in The Blair Witch Project!18. Every seven years, people in Madagascar dig up their ancestors, change their clothes and dance with them in the19. The bodies of members of some Hindu castes are considered too sacred for cremation and so are floated down the Ganges river in India. The Aghori Babas take these bodies and eat them in a ritual as a symbol of triumphing over fear. For them the biggest fear for the living is death, so eating the dead bodies is a way to conquer it. The Aghori do quite a lot of disgusting stuff.20. In Papua New Guinea, the Fore tribe also eat dead bodies. When a member of a tribe dies, the whole tribe cooks and eats the bod. Women and children eat the brain while men eat the flesh. This is done in the hope that the spirit of the deceased will stay close to living family and tribe members. This tradition was technically banned after an outbreak of so-called ""hysteria"" in the 1950s.21. How about we set aside a day to worship the penis? Well, that’s what the people of Kawasaki in Japan have done; they have decided to celebrate fertility and the “power” of the penis. This is also called Shinto fertility festival, Shinto beliefs of openness use of nature and deliberate simplicity. Shinto is a Japanese religion, it focuses on ritual practices to be carried out diligently, to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past. This interesting ritual takes place every year on the first Sunday of every April, with all kinds of phallic activities going on.22. In the Menses rituals of Uaupes, Brazil, girls are brought out naked on the streets and are beaten to death or till they are unconscious. Why? The reason is shocking but easy to guess, as are most reasons related to women opression. If the girls still wake up after this extremely cruel treatment, they are considered 'womanly' and 'worthy' of marriage. So much for proving your worth and even then, somehow it is never enough!23. In some countries, mothers eat their own placenta after giving birth. Why? All of it for the nutrients that the placenta contains. This tradition is followed in China. I'll leave it on you to decide if this ritual is right for the baby and the mother.24. In Denmark, people throw cinnamon on anyone who is single. At least as long as those men and women are over the age of 25. If you are single in Denmark and you hit 30, you get pepper thrown on you.

65,"The Mystery of LamIn the early 20th century, occultist Aleister Crowley conducted the Amalantrah Workings, in which he would attempt to invoke supernatural entities through the visions of his partner and medium, Roddie Minor. Crowley (preferred by him to be pronounced like the bird), was infamous for his presence in the occult scene, titling himself “the Beast 666.”The main focus of his work was the summoning of the intelligence known as “Lam” (meaning “path” in Tibetan). Crowley would go on to have multiple alleged encounters with this being in 1918. His illustration ofThe Mystery of LamIn the early 20th century, occultist Aleister Crowley conducted the Amalantrah Workings, in which he would attempt to invoke supernatural entities through the visions of his partner and medium, Roddie Minor. Crowley (preferred by him to be pronounced like the bird), was infamous for his presence in the occult scene, titling himself “the Beast 666.”The main focus of his work was the summoning of the intelligence known as “Lam” (meaning “path” in Tibetan). Crowley would go on to have multiple alleged encounters with this being in 1918. His illustration of Lam, from that year, is shown below:Does it remind you of anything? Crowley also associated Lam with something known as the Egg, which it purportedly uses as a mechanism for inter-dimensional travel, or teleportation.The description of this vessel is highly reminiscent of many alleged alien encounters reported later on, but the connection is particularly clear in the infamous Lonnie Zamora case. If you don’t already know, Lonnie Zamora was a police officer in the 1960s who claims that he, on a chase to pursue a speeder, witnessed a massive explosion in the wilderness nearby. This led him to abandon the chase and pull aside to investigate, only to discover what looked to be two small men tending to an ovoid craft. Before he had time to gather his wits, the door slammed shut and he saw the ship take off, along with multiple other witnesses later on.Below is Lonnie’s illustration:Later members of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis (Lt. “Order of the Eastern Temple”) did make it abundantly clear that they believed Lam and the modern ideas ofSome members became fixated on studying Lam and the other “trans-mundane” entities (note: the term “extraterrestrial” was coined in 1956, decades later). They made several things clear:Now, this part’s important:Two other members—renowned rocket scientistThe result nonetheless was the expansion of Lam’s portal, as the two were admittedly not as deft in closing the portal as Crowley had been. Only a year and a half later, the age of UFO sightings began withAs the century progressed, the Order under Kenneth Grant cleared up their beliefs on “the Great Old One” (intentionally referred to in the singular). They say the beings operate between the Sirius and Andromeda star systems, and that Lam is actually actively supporting their agenda. It is the Order’s conviction that the Age of UFOs is but a sign of the impending end of our age… whatever that might actually imply.“Colored version of the Whore of Babylon illustration from Martin Luther's 1534 translation of the Bible.”So, in sum, occultists gave early descriptions of what looked to be grey aliens well before they were publicized. Even if you’re not convinced whatever they dealt with was aliens, that’s certainly their belief. Additionally, just before the start of the Age of UFOs and the innumerable reports that brought the concept of the extraterrestrial to the public, OTO members claimed to have permanently opened Lam’s portal. If these events are to be viewed as more than coincidental, this suggests that we have the concept of aliens on its head—UFOs are actually esoteric, occult phenomena, not ones necessarily of science. And, perhaps the most frightening part of all this, the results of the Babylon Working are unknown. No one’s sure whether the new age is almost here, or even if it’s here right now. No one knows whether the moonchild was ever spawned or not. No one outside the inner ranks of the OTO, that is.Coincidence or no coincidence, I think it’s undeniable that these facts at minimum constitute one hell of a story.More information about the Babylon Working:Okay, this is sort of a long-winded exposition of some of the things I’ve learned. Please note that none of these are my personal beliefs.Again, the purpose of the Working was to spawn a moonchild. This moonchild would apparently be the spirit of the Whore of Babylon given in the Book of Revelation birthed from a human womb, seemingly paralleling the birth of Jesus.I’m not much of a Bible scholar myself, but there are a couple things I think should be connected. There seems to be a belief among members of the Order that Lam is a manifestation of what’s called “Lucifer-Gnosis.” Now, Gnosticism and Luciferianism are two very similar belief systems, both believing that the God of the Bible is tyrannical, ignorant, and actually the antagonist.On Luciferianism: The mythos of Lucifer is very common even in Mesopotamian cultures preceding the Bible, always describing a light-bringer, striving for heavenly dominion, often through his pride, but failing and being cast into the underworld by the chief deity. (The character of “Lucifer” in all these traditions is seen as the embodiment of the morning star, or Phosphoros, and gets its meaning from the star’s nature, which is actually just the planet Venus: its brightness, the fact it never reaches the place of the other stars up high, etc.) To those in the Order of the Luciferian stripe, Lucifer was the real protagonist, trying to bring knowledge to humans despite the ignorance brought by God, which they see plainly shown in the myth of Adam and Eve. (The snake, identified with/as Lucifer, encourages Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, for which they are punished by the creator God, and make their own fall from heaven, the original sin)Gnostics believe Jesus to be the hero opposing God, yet both Jesus and Lucifer are interestingly referred to as the “morning star” in parts of the Bible. “Gnosis” is the Gnostic view of spiritual enlightenment/salvation. Gnosticism is fundamentally a rejection of the physical world, which was thought to be created by the biblical God.I also don’t think it’s a coincidence that the Whore of Babylon is what’s being reified. Babylon is portrayed as a wicked city of sin in the New Testament, and Lucifer is also described in Isaiah as the King of Babylon (although some believe the passage refers to an actual unnamed king). Nevertheless, the Age of Osiris will probably be a realignment of humanity away from the biblical God.Other sources:Main source and a great investigative piece by occult journalist Dan Boudillion:For related information, this is a fascinating Vice article I’d recommend:—",0 followers,Bibek Pokhrel,604,54,6M,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

In order to do this, an elderly person, ideally near death, would volunteer themselves to the process of being binge-bathed in honey, and given only honey to eat, until their entire digestive system was honey. Then, when the volunteer died, they would be covered in honey for 100 years. After this century or so, the contents were turned into a candy that was said to heal broken bones.Pexels4.

Two Can Keep a Secret if One of Them Is DeadNo one knows how famed creepy writer Edgar Allan Poe died. At least, those who did know are long since dead, and all firm records of his death have been lost. Poe was found on Baltimore’s streets on October 3, 1849. Eerily, he was wearing someone else’s clothes. He was in pretty bad shape, and died in hospital just four days later. He was never coherent enough to explain what had happened, and he kept shouting “Reynolds” the night before his death. There’s nothing left from his medical records, including even his death certificate. Speculation about the cause of his death ranges anywhere from suicide, cholera, heart disease, epilepsy, and even murder. He was only 40 years old.Flickr2.

Even when her father and the government stepped in to finally bury Philip, their separation did not last long. Joanna ordered him exhumed, leapt at his coffin, and kissed his dead feet.

One of the more sinister devices to come out of this collaboration is what might best be called a “heart attack gun”.The idea is that the weapon shot a small poisoned dart into the intended target. The person who was shot would feel nothing other than perhaps the sting associated with a mosquito bite. The dart would completely disintegrate within a matter of seconds.The poison contained in the dart was designed to cause a fatal heart attack in the victim. The causative agent supposedly disintegrated quickly and was impossible to detect on autopsy.Does this all sound too James Bond-ish to be true?

The Banned TrailerWhen the movie trailer for3. Down to the BoneIn the Czech Republic, there is a church called The Sedlec Ossuary that has decorations made entirely of human bones. This happened because there were too many people in the cemetery to bury everyone, and the church leaders claimed that if their bones became part of the church, it only made them closer to God. Nice propaganda spin there, guys.4. Buzz offThe Japanese Hornet is one the largest and most venomous hornets in the world. A sting from this bug can result in kidney failure.5. Oh Twin Brother, Where Art Thou?In 2015, a young woman began to have headaches. They discovered that she had a brain tumor, and when the doctors removed it, they were shocked to see that it was a lump resembling skin that contained bone, teeth, and hair. But this was no parasitic twin: the mass was called a “teratoma,” or “monstrous tumor.” When the woman was an embryo, some cell tissue fell off and ended up where wasn’t supposed to be, her brain. It then develop hair and teeth while the rest of her grew as normal.6. A Warrior’s BloodIn ancient Rome, some people believed that if they drank fresh, warm blood from a fallen Gladiator, they would absorb their power. They also believed that drinking blood cured epilepsy.7. Horrible Protein SmoothiesIn the 1600s, alchemists were hardcore into finding eternal life, and they came up with some pretty disgusting theories and supposed elixirs along the way. One such alchemist, John French, used to prepare a “brain tincture,” if you can guess what that was made of. He then left the mixture to sit inside of horse manure for six months, until it became a liquid and could be drunk. The worst thing of all? French had plenty of other colleagues trying out similar medicine.8. I Pray the Lord My Soul to TakeFour of the actors in the 1982 horror movie9. Six Feet UnderIn the 19th century and before, being literally buried alive was an ever-present worry, as medicine could sometimes mistake a comatose or otherwise unresponsive patient for a cadaver. Because of this, people developed “safety coffins” that would allow the buried person to alert those above ground that the corpse in the coffin was not, in fact, a corpse.10. A Boy’s Best FriendAround 1904, a boy named Robert Eugene Otto, or “Gene,” owned a strange-looking doll of a boy, who he named Robert. Robert the Doll is said to be haunted, aware of what is going on around him, and even responsible for multiple violent mishaps. Robert’s tale formed the basis for the film11. The Wonders of the Human BodyIn Philadelphia, The Mutter Museum is filled with fascinating and disgusting bits of human anatomy that have been preserved. Mutations, tumors, and medical anomalies are on full display. Just don’t go if you have a weak stomach.12. Wow, Those Look Real!Back in the 1960s, the skeletons in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland were real. At the time, they thought that fake skeletons didn’t look scary enough. So they contacted the UCLA medical department and bought loads of skeletons that were usually used in anatomy classrooms. As time went on, fake skeletons started to look more convincing. Disney claims that they gave the real skeletons proper burials, but many speculate that there could be at least a couple real ones left over on the ride.13. What a ChatterboxJust like dolls, ventriloquist dummies have become a theme in horror movies. One of R.L. Stine’s most memorable villains is a ventriloquist’s dummy named Slappy. Well, if they creep you out, don’t go to the Ven Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. It’s filled with vintage ventriloquist dummies. If you’re scared of dolls, this place is probably your worst nightmare.14. That Could Have Been Bad…In January of 2017, a 100-foot asteroid nicknamed AG13 passed by Earth. It was less than the distance of the moon, and just missed hitting our planet. Scientists only saw that it was coming roughly two days before it could have hit Earth.15. Frozen in TimeMadame Tussaud’s wax museum is famous around the world for frighteningly life-like figures of celebrities. What most people don’t know, however, is that Madame Anna Maria Tussaud got her start by rushing over to grab heads from the guillotine during the French Revolution. She used these heads to showcase her waxing process.16. Devil’s Advocate“The Devil’s Bible,” also called the Codex Gigas, is a legendary Latin manuscript that’s said to be the product of a monk’s bargain with Satan himself. In the 13th century, a monk was about to be executed for his crimes unless he could compose a single, impressive work in one night. To achieve this impossible task, the monk sold his soul to Satan and produced this 165-pound, three-feet-long book. While that’s just a legend, The Devil’s Bible17. Do I Know You?After a stroke or some sort of brain trauma, some people can develop “prosopagnosia,” also known as “facial agnosia.” This is when someone loses the ability to recognize faces. Even if it’s your best friend, you would no longer be able to distinguish a face from anything else. Many people suffering from prosopagnosia won’t even recognize themselves when looking in a mirror.18. Deadly SinsIn the Catholic religion, Purgatory is an intermediate place where souls go that is neither Heaven nor the hot place down below. In Rome, there is a small museum that claims to have documentation of hauntings from people whose souls are stuck in Purgatory, generally manifesting as a burn mark on the pages of the Bible and other objects.19. Haunted Plague IslandPoveglia, Italy is considered to be the most haunted island in the world, as untold numbers of people dying of the plague were quarantined there in the 18th century. In the 20th century, the island was then used to hold a mental asylum, and it currently lies abandoned and undeveloped. Any takers?20. Brain FoodDo you ever wonder what people did before the invention of assembly-line cups and bowls? In ancient England, people used the tops of hollowed human skulls to drink and eat.21. Do the WaveIn 1934, a mountain slide dumped heavy rocks into a lake near a town called Tafjord in Norway, a small, remote town. The slide triggered a 203-foot tsunami that hit Tafjord, killing 40 people and injuring even more. This real-life event inspired a horror movie called22. Moss DefinitelyHundreds of years ago, when people died on the battlefield or elsewhere outside, their bodies often just lay there until they rotted away. As they decomposed, their skulls would start to grow a moss called usnea. People believed that this moss contained the spiritual qualities of the fallen soldiers, and they would gather it up as medicine. Apparently, usnea that grew on hanged men’s skulls was seen as the most effective.23. Massive WavesThe biggest tsunami on record was 1,720 feet tall. It hit Lituya Bay in Alaska in 1958. Scientific evidence shows that this area is likely to be hit with another tsunami eventually.24. Don’t Judge a Book by Its CoverAt Harvard University, there is a book bound in human skin.25. A Long Time ComingAmong the Toraja people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, when a family member dies, they aren’t immediately buried. The Toraja think of death as a process, not a sudden change, and their elaborate funerals can take place months or even years after the death. During this period, the body of the deceased is wrapped in cloth, and is thought to wander around the village until the departed person is finally officially laid to rest.26. Memento MoriVictorian England had a bunch of strange fads. For example, tattoos were very popular, especially with Victorian women. Bizarrely, post-mortem photography was also all the rage. In these photographs, people would take a recently deceased family member and stage them, either in a family portrait or alone, as if the deceased was just sleeping or resting. Sadly, these people still looked totally dead.27. Dead and DazzlingHonestly, Victorian people were really weird. In addition to being obsessed with post-mortem photography of their dead loved ones, they also liked to wear jewellery out of these deceased family members and friends, often incorporating teeth, hair, and bones into rings, necklaces, and the like.28. Bite MeIn ancient China, there was a process of making a “mellified man,” which was essentially mummifying someone with honey. In order to do this, an elderly person, ideally near death, would volunteer themselves to the process of being binge-bathed in honey, and given only honey to eat, until their entire digestive system was honey. Then, when the volunteer died, they would be covered in honey for 100 years. After this century or so, the contents were turned into a candy that was said to heal broken bones.29. Small But DeadlyThe Black Death was serious business centuries ago, and there’s a reason it became an epidemic.30. Two Can Keep a Secret if One of Them Is DeadNo one knows how famed creepy writer Edgar Allan Poe died. At least, those who did know are long since dead, and all firm records of his death have been lost. Poe was found on Baltimore’s streets on October 3, 1849. Eerily, he was wearing someone else’s clothes. He was in pretty bad shape, and died in hospital just four days later. He was never coherent enough to explain what had happened, and he kept shouting “Reynolds” the night before his death. There’s nothing left from his medical records, including even his death certificate. Speculation about the cause of his death ranges anywhere from suicide, cholera, heart disease, epilepsy, and even murder. He was only 40 years old.Source-Thanks for reading.","89,897 followers",Alisha Talks,10.5K,908,102.5M,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

But think about this:A few number stationists (let’s just call them that) once tracked down the location of the Lincolnshire Poacher (the one above) to an British military station in Cuba. It was shortly after closed down.Sometime in the 20th century the police arrested 10 suspects believed to be spies.
