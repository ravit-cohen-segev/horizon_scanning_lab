To reduce the upfront costs, it is recommended that you join a mining pool. Mining pools allow miners to share resources and capabilities. Even still, the high volatility of Bitcoin can add uncertainty to the mining venture, and you must carefully consider that before you decide to hop on the crypto bandwagon.In this year, crypto is growing steadily with many projects in the market. According to latest reviews, HubCoin is one of the greatest choices for long-term holding. Since HubCoin is operated through the use of smart contracts, it eliminates the need for any middleman leading to gamers being fairly rewarded what they are due. It ensures that gamers are properly remunerated through its well defined and structured smart contracts and gamified systems.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-coin-mining-still-profitable
1,"Well yes, of course! Who says only big ones like BTC or ETH can make any profit? I mean, besides, there are projects that have the potential to bring huge profits to investors, but very few people know about them. Let's talk about COTI, ARK, CSPR... or Luminos, an utility token that is used throughout the supply chain of nickel mining.

I mean luminos is an upcoming cryptocurrency exchange, after listing on exchanges can be profitable at 100x.AbouWell yes, of course! Who says only big ones like BTC or ETH can make any profit?

I mean luminos is an upcoming cryptocurrency exchange, after listing on exchanges can be profitable at 100x.About Luminos, this is a project with a very good foundation and a lot of potential. They also try hard to develop more in many other fields such as gaming (VICE) or platform called Fandoms that allows artists, musicians, and other content creators to market and sell their digital work and services to their fans, generating revenue through the platform's subscription service, auction, or NFT sale.There's a thing that I really like about this project is that it protects any content uploaded to the blockchain from censorship or removal by any central authority, ensuring freedom of creation and distribution by the decentralized blockchain technology, which is currently unavailable anywhere else.
