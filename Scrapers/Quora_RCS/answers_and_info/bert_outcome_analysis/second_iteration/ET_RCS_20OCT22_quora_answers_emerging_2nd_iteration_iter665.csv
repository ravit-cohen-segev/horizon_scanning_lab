Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.",241 followers,Sonali Kerketta,22.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-other-premiere-scientific-research-institutes-in-India-apart-from-IISER-and-IISc

The first was that Seymour Cray was a genius of a computer architect. The second was that he was willing to burn a lot of power.I heard him speak once at Stanford, just wow. You can study the machine designs yourself.The other factor I know a little about. The Cray machines were built with emitter coupled logic, which was very very fast, but used a lot of power compared to other circuit designs for logic gates. The transistors in ECL operate in their linear regions and never saturate. This lets them switch very fast, much faster than other schemes, but the downside is that they are always using a constant amount of power, even when just sitting there. ECL designs are usually careful to always have balanced circuits, so when current increases somewhere, it decreases somewhere else, which leads to constant current power supplies.. A third design point is that ECL gates are capable of driving low impedance loads, which lets you arrange the wiring of the computer as transmission lines. You get incident wave switching, which cuts wire delays in half, again at the expense of power.It is a general rule of thumb that you can build a computer with a clock cycle that permits about ten gate delays between clock edges. The Cray 1 ran at 100 MHz, which, more or less, requires 1 nanosecond gates at a time when most people were building computers out of TTL with 10 or 15 nanosecond gates, plus TTLs horrible signal qualities and asymmetric output stages. Schottky TTL was a little faster, but with even worse signalling, because the high switching rates would cause glitches everywhere in nearby high impedance wiring.ECL signalling is usually 50 ohm transmission lines, with beautifully smooth switching transients. A moderate level of discipline among the board designers can get you reliable logic boards without any drama.In the same way that true expert generals study logistics, Cray studied power and cooling, the logistics of computer systems.",UNKNOWN,HB,40.7K,64,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-lesser-known-facts-about-Indias-first-supercomputer

There is the method of how to let go and clean your mind and how to recover and find your true mind within.Deep inside our mind, there are so many thoughts that we accumulated from our lived life. For example all the past (the moments you had a conflict with other, memories that you failed, etc), worry about the future, etc. These kinds of thoughts make us hard to put into action. Also, prevent the brain from working sharply and intuitively.

Since we all know that what we do not use is likely to wither and waste away, it is very important to do stuff that can make the brain smarter and faster. Making your brain smarter and faster doesn’t always mean that you have to keep studying or become a reclusive bookworm. There are many simple tips and tricks that can make your brain faster, sharper, and smarter and they usually involve lifestyle and dietary changes alongside some behavioral traits that can flex the grey matter. So here are the easy ways to make your brain faster and smarter.1. Work your memoryMemory is the most important part of a smarter and faster brain. For students, whatever you read during the day, make sure you read it immediately at night before sleep. This is because; the brain consolidates all of this new information during rest. This allows the brain to store the things you read before sleeping in its limbic area. Memory can also be developed through sights, sounds, touch, and smells. Our sense organs are connected intricately to the brain’s limbic area. So any particular sound (songs) or smells (aromas of cooking, the fragrance of perfumes or essential oils, etc) can transform you to a different time and place. Many students actually learn faster while diffusing certain aroma-therapeutic oils (2. Make associationsYour brain helps you memorize and recall things by using 3 concepts – associations, imagination, and location. So, if you wish to remember the 5 Great Lakes, you can use the acronym HOMES to remember Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior.3. Make goalsMake achievable goals; they need not be huge ones. The important thing is to try and do a bit every day. Just keep at it and your job every day is to ensure not breaking the habit.4. Eat foods that boost brain powerThe best foods for the brain are omega 3 fish oil, proteins, B complex, Curcumin, Ginseng, and Gingko Biloba. Take these supplements under the guidance of your doctor. Avoid coffee and tea. Choose foods with Low GI such as cereals, brown rice, fruits, vegetables, legumes, etc.5. Think positive and stay happyPeople who think positive are naturally more creative and their brain is also more receptive to ideas making it sharper and smarter.6. MeditationPeople who meditate are likelier to have a sharper, smarter brain according to this7. Play brain gamesTop brain games8. Do mental mathInstead of whipping out the calculator, do a little mental math while you are at the grocery store. Try and total up the amount for items purchased. These simple tips can keep your brain sharper.9. Read every dayReading can do amazing things for your mind and brain. According to a10. Listen to musicMusic might not make your brain smarter and sharper, but it can certainly give it a11. LaughMan can be distinguished from other animals because of his ability to laugh. So laugh every day for boosting your brainpower.12. Sleep wellA13. Too much technology hurts your brain powerAccording to s Dr. Sandra Bond Chapman, a neuroscientist, too much of technology is making our brain attention deficit. So slow down, keep your ‘smart’ devices switched off from time to time, and certainly do not check your email before bed.14. Slow downThe fast-paced lives we lead and make our kids lead is not good for the brain. Slow down, dig deeper and take a break from time to time.15. Avoid multi-taskingDo one task at a time always. Whatever you do, do it 100%.16. Stretch and challenge your brainTeach your mind to construct deeper level, abstract ideas. For example, when you just attend a meet, try and construct a newspaper-headline describing it.17. Live your passionWhen you do something you enjoy, the brain’s juices motivate it into becoming stronger and smarter. So invest time in your hobbies.Published by","66,016 followers",Niklas Göke,55.9K,235,32.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-lesser-known-facts-about-Indias-first-supercomputer

At the time, I didn't know who his father was.Maybe not.John, the son, disappeared and we lost touch. I last saw him I think in 1988.Maybe they are mentally strong. Maybe not.Often many of us are very good at constructing masks and it is never really known what is deep inside of us. What we keep hidden for fear of death if others were to find out.But I can tell you what is most in common with some of the people I have encountered and maybe then you can tell me if you think these are qualities of mentally strong people. I would like to know.All of these things...anyone can do. Anyone can learn to be mentally strong and change the world as a result.Wealth, health, success, strong relationships, and freedom seem to be byproducts of the traits listed below.Here's my trick:I list, for each item, 1-10 on where I rank and then I add them up. So somewhere between 0 and 100.Then every day I try to improve by 1.A) RELATIONSHIPSThe mentally strong people I know, the ones who have achieved the most in life, have ALL had incredibly strong relationships.Friends, spouses, partners, and so on. I've interviewed billionaires, well known movie directors, athletes, scientists, artists. All have believed in the saying ""you are the average of the five people you spend your time with"".If you build up strong relationships, it means they are supporting your ideas, adding to them, helping you execute them, and not constantly fighting you or dragging you down.B) HONESTYThis is not religious but math. The brain takes up 2% of the body's mass and burns up 25% of the body's calories each day. One in four calories you eat goes to fuel your brain.When you lie, one side of your brain has to deal with one set of lies. And the other side of the brain has to deal with the other set of lies. So to be at optimal mental strength you now need twice as many calories. This is impossible.So the best way to be mentally strong is to be honest so all of the fuel in your body can be used efficiently at propelling your brain from strength to strength instead of fighting off the attacks on your weaknesses.C) IT'S NOT ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT YOUWhenever a girl broke up with me, it never seemed to be about me. That's ok. That was a line to make me feel better.I guess I should be grateful for the many people who tried to make me feel better by blaming themselves.But true mentally strong people constantly are focused on others. They are solving problems for other people.They don't think, ""How can I make money"" since money is just pieces of paper fueled by a mythological story.They think, ""What are problems in the world that I can solve?""They think, for instance, healthcare is a mess. And since we all know ""prevention is the cure"", how can I develop a product that helps with prevention and diagnostics.And, if you were a genius like Elizabeth Holmes, you would drop out of Stanford, make a company called Theranos, and do exactly that.That is just one example.Mentally strong people are always solving other people's problems. The problems of the individual get solved as a byproduct of solving the problems of the many.D) READINGI've interviewed over 150 people now for my podcast. Here is one question nobody ever hesitates on: What are the last books you've read?Do you know why mentally strong people read? I have my guess.We all have one life to live. But when you read, you get to absorb the curated life of another person in just a few days.So if you read a lot, your one brain can hold onto the critical points of potentially thousands of other incredible people. You can bathe in their lives and come out a stronger you.I asked Freeway Rick Ross, the largest drug dealer ever, what books he read in prison that turned around his life.He couldn't read or write before prison. But then he taught himself. He told me instantly: ""As A Man Thinketh"", ""The Richest Man in Babylon"", and ""Think and Grow Rich"".I asked Tim Ferriss, author of The Four Hour Work Week. He said, ""Radical Acceptance"", ""Essentialism"", and ""The Effective Executive"".All 150 people I have interviewed gave answers instantly. I have no doubt if I ask them again next week they will all have different answers. I have never met a mentally strong person who wasn't a voracious reader.E) HEALTHBecause the brain burns so many calories, you have to have health in other areas of your life.It's hard to be mentally strong, to be creative, to execute, to change the world, if you are sick in bed.This is not being judgmental towards those sick in bed. Sometimes we just get sick. We can't help it.But almost everyone I've ever dealt with in business or in life who has gone on to greater and great successes all acknowledged the importance of constant healthy transformation of their bodies.This doesn't mean lift 500 pounds. It means sleep eight hours a day. It means eat well (which simply means: less on processed foods, more on vegetables, and exchange your 15 inch plates for 10 inch plates), and move.Movement doesn't mean running a marathon. It might just mean walking a lot.Our paleo ancestors got their exercise from walking and climbing on their daily hunt for food. This kept them healthy enough to be our ancestors so I thank them every day for that by following their model.F) CURIOSITYIf you are talking to someone and they say something interesting but you don't understand, do you interrupt them and ask them what they mean?Sometimes I'm afraid to ask questions because I don't want to seem stupid or I don't want someone to be annoyed at me or I'm feeling shy.The only way to learn new things is to ask questions and be curious. Find the people who inspire your curiosity because those are the ones you will most learn from.Then ask them questions.The more stupid you feel asking a question, the more you HAVE to ask the question. If you feel shy asking one question, then ask TWO questions.Every mentally strong person has this one thing in common: the things they most remember that has changed their lives have been the answers to questions they asked.If they never asked those questions, their lives would not have changed.G) LEARN, SAY, REPEATWe think we learn in school. We take a class and a brilliant professor gives a lecture and we supposedly leave the class smarter.But here is the science. Within 45 minutes of leaving a class, college students have already forgotten 80% of what was said in the class. By the next day, they have forgotten just about 100%.Here's how to remember: First you hear something. If it interests you, write it down as a note (carry a notebook. I carry a waiter's pad because they are cheap).Then use it in a conversation within an hour. Then use it in a conversation the next day and then the next.NOW there is a decent chance you have learned it. Because you build various connections in your brain that have now been programmed with that nugget of information. That's how learning takes place. Mentally strong people learn how to learn.H) THE IDEA MUSCLEPeople say ""ideas are a dime a dozen"". This is simply not true. Ideas are ""a dime for three"".Go ahead and try. Come up with 10 ideas for surprises for your spouse's next anniversary. The first three are easy. But, for me, then it gets harder and by #7 I'm counting the list over and over again to see if I reached 10.If you get hit by a bike and are stuck in bed for two weeks recovering, then when you leave the bed your leg muscles are so atrophied you need therapy to walk again.The same with the idea muscle. It needs to be exercised every day or it will atrophy.How do you exercise it? Pick a theme, any theme will do, and write down ten ideas a day. Every day.I can tell you that when I was broke and suicidal and scared I started doing this. My life has changed 100% every six months since then. It's been incredible. Like magic.I wrote this and shared this with others. Now I get emails from people every six months telling me how their lives have changed.When I was interviewing the rapper Coolio he told me he wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before he had his first hit. A year after his first hit he had the best selling song on the entire planet.When he described that song to me he described which elements from which musicians who came before him that he meshed together to create his hit.This is called ""idea sex"". When you are an expert in one category and an expert in another then you are the greatest in the world at the intersection.What about execution? Execution ideas are just a subset of regular ideas. If you have an idea you want to execute on, then your idea list the next day should be, ""What are the ten next steps I need to take?""Should you then take them? I don't know. Mentally strong people probably make those lists 100 times a year and only need to execute on one of them to change the world.Give yourself permission to have bad ideas. It's only through diligent mining of the universe inside of you that you find the gems that will light up the world.I) PERMISSIONMentally strong people give themselves permission.Why did the Google guys come up with the 8th search engine and think theirs was special? Why did Elizabeth Holmes think it was ok to drop out of the best school in the country to pursue a business dream?Why did Henry Ford, after failing twice at car companies, think it was a good idea to start a third car company. Why did the Wright Brothers think it was ok to make a plane with spare parts from their bicycle shop when the government was spending tens of millions?They all gave themselves permission to do something that has never been done before.They all gave themselves permission to have many bad ideas.They all gave themselves permission to risk their reputation and the forked tongues of the people who would fight them.They gave themselves permission to slip and fall and get up and dust themselves off and try again. And again. And again. And again.They gave themselves permission to love something so strong that every neuron on their brain would light up and conspire to make their dreams come true.If you don't give yourself permission to create a new world, chances are nobody else will.J) PRESENCEI regret so many things from my past. Maybe that one time I lost all of my money, I could've used it to help my father live a little bit longer than he did.And all of the time I am anxious. Will I give a good speech. Will this business I invest in work out? I hope it does. I don't want to go broke again.Time traveling seems exciting but it isn't. You can time travel all your life and then suddenly you are dead without ever having lived in the present moment, the only moment that exists.Whenever mentally strong people find themselves time traveling they take a step back. They said, ""What can I do right now to help others"" instead of wasting time regretting the past or worrying about the future.Worry and regret never solves tomorrow's problems and only drains away energy from today.Presence will always solve this moment's problems.Mentally strong people solve problems, love people, are curious, stay healthy, have idea sex, are honest with you, and make the world a better place.I hope each day I can improve a little on each level. And if I run into you on the street, maybe we can wink at each other. We're on the same team.",16 followers,Chris Wojcik,5.9K,388,12.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-my-brain-sharper-smarter-and-lightning-fast

Environment factors like healthcare and nutrition, home environment and parenting also contribute to one’s intelligence in adulthood.So, if you’re now an adult and you want to become smarter, you should pick up healthy habits that train your intelligence and nourish your mind, and persevere with them Some people are born smart, but most intelligent people do daily routines to maintain their intelligence, which is specifically the ability to think critically, solve problems, and adapt to changing environments. Whether they work in creative industries, business industries, or any other field, they push and challenge themselves daily.You can refer to some of the following ways.- Set clear goals, learn how to manage time, create challenges for yourself, and participate in new activities to refresh your life and think more in retrospect. This not only makes your life interesting but also stimulates the brain to work more flexibly.- Apply knowledge flexibly, learn something new and recall it every day. Continuous mental work increases brain acuity.Oh, and if you want to learn and memorize something fast, here are some useful tips from the Grand Master of Memory in Singapore, Nishant Kasibhatla. In this video, he shares his special formula that will help you remember any kind of information – in a stress-free way.- Practice and maintain a positive mindset such as: reading books, listening to classical music, having deep conversations with friends, and getting to know optimistic people, etc. These activities will help you learn from others’ experiences without actually going through them, thereby stimulating creativity in the process of studying and working.- Create a habit of reading books - read seriously, read as much as possible. Reading books will nourish your intellect thanks to the amount of knowledge accumulated through reading.- Build relationships that are meaningful to you. And a special way to do it is to share. Learning something new is important, but sharing that knowledge will make what you've learned actionable and meaningful.

In a nutshell, IQ is a ""fixed mindset"" concept. She recounts the story of how IQ tests developed, and explains that it was never meant to be a fixed measure of anything.This is not a new idea: back in 1983, Howard Gardner proposed his ""But what does this say about how we can develop our thinking skills?Well, for one thing 'computational' speed is not the key issue: your brain already works faster, and can handle far more complexity, than any computer can. And ""concluding stuff"" needs qualifying: we want to draw the 'right' conclusions. But what does 'right' mean?Let's unpack this starting with a simple metaphor that summarises my understanding, and embodies the findings from neuroscience and cognitive psychology research (which we come to later).Navigation as a metaphor for thinking skillsTo state the obvious, a boat skipper's goal is to get from A to B. A racing skipper wants to do this as fast as possible, whereas a cruising skipper wants the crew to enjoy the journey.So he plans how to do this by studying his maps (strictly speaking these are called charts). He tracks the weather patterns to anticipate wind and sea conditions, looks up tide tables to understand the impact of heights of tide on his departure from or entry into ports, and uses tidal atlases to figure out the effect of currents on the boat during his journey. Using simple trigonometry, he can then plot a course that takes into account boat speed resulting from expected wind and tide.Whilst a modern yacht has lots of electronics that make it easier, the basic principles haven't changed in thousands of years of seafaring. To make any navigation decisions you need to know your direction and speed of travel, your last known position, and you need a set of maps that cover the waters you will cross on your way from A to B.The function of the brain is to navigate from moment to moment, through known and unknown waters. To do this, it must make predictions: what will happen if I do X or say Y? It uses mental maps of how the world works, based on both theory (from trusted sources) and experience. And your brain's maps are unique to you: nobody has exactly the same maps as you.These maps are stored in your memories, scattered across your brain's neural network. However, as the adage goes, the map is not the territory. It is a representation, based on your current knowledge and experience. Your maps can be expanded and updated. And they can be wrong.Your stream of consciousness is mostly filled with the same old thoughtsTo state the obvious, we experience life as a stream of consciousness from moment to moment. Our notion of our self as a fixed identity, is a construct in memory called ""me."" Who I am is a story I tell myself, based on memories that serve the projects I am pursuing at any point in time. Deep stuff, I know... but this does get very practical!If you examine your thoughts in reflection, becoming self aware as you pay attention to your thoughts (writing them down is a good way of playing with this), you will notice that you have the same thoughts much of the time. The stories we tell ourselves tend to repeat, as they embody our values and beliefs.You will also notice that you don't like all your thoughts, or that many thoughts are self-defeating. Freud might have said this is your ego talking.All of this is what I think of as (rather crudely) the crap in my head. It's often a mess in there. To think clearly, I have to clear it. So how do you get out of this loop of old thinking, and start learning and thinking in new ways?In a word: practice. Practice is where mastery comes from, in any field of human endeavour. This is as true of the physical craftsmanship of a master joiner making bespoke furniture, as it is of a research scientist searching for the next breakthrough in quantum theory.But what can you practice to improve your thinking skills?The power of questionsEverything stored in your brain is what Professor Beau Lotto calls your ""personal history."" You can only perceive what is conceptualised in personal history, and so to see things outside of your experience you have to learn. But how do you go beyond what you already know?Professor Beau LottoThe process of seeing things differently begins with a question that you ask yourself. The process of ""seeing yourself seeing"" is the essence of self awareness: it enables you to question your assumptions, and challenge your 'old thinking' on a person or problem.The reason this is difficult is that the brain is wired to automate as much as possible, out of sight of your conscious mind. TheAnd the problem gets worse: as Lotto pointed out in his lecture, ""the brain hates uncertainty!"" And that feeling of confusion and brain fog that you get when you try to muddle through unfamiliar learning territory? That's what uncertainty FEELS like.My favourite bit of Lotto's talk (I don't know if it's in his 2017 book, ""Deviate: the science of seeing differently"" as I've bought it but haven't actually read it yet) was when a real ah-ha moment slapped me into conscious awareness. Do you know which human activity is the ONLY activity that we undertake, where the purpose of the activity is the activity itself? It's called play. We play in order to play. Think about it: all other activities have a purpose beyond the activity.Why does this matter? Well, play is also the only activity where we do not resist uncertainty! We actively embrace it. As Lotto pointed out, if you knew the outcome of a game of tennis, what would be the point in playing?The key point is this: questions create the feeling of uncertainty, which the brain struggles with. Unless you invoke a state of play. Playing with ideas, not struggling to achieve anything, will unlock the right mental state in which to question yourself.The problem with our conclusionsTo draw better conclusions, we need better inputs. One of the things that cognitive psychology tells us is that our brains don't handle probability well, which is a problem for predicting anything!That neural network that is your memory works through association: each neuron is literally connected to thousands of other neurons. But those associations create a bias in our thinking that can corrupt our prediction-making machine. Here's an example from a research project byWilliam is a short, shy man.As Kunda comments, ""one is tempted to guess that William is a classics scholar. After all, he seems so much more similar to our image of classics scholars that to our image of farmers.""But the flaw in our reasoning is simple statistics: we ignore ""prior probabilities of outcomes"" in favour of making simple associations. In other words, there are more farmers than the handful of classics scholars in society, and so it is more likely to find a farmer who matches William's description than a scholar who does.What this points to is one of many cognitive biases that operate outside of conscious awareness. A great book to get an overview of cognitive bias is ""In short summarySelf awareness is required to know your own mind, and its processes and biases. Asking yourself questions, and playing with ideas, leads to new discoveries and to seeing things in new ways. This replaces 'old thinking' with new insight.Regularly engaging in this type of learning will expand your maps of how the world works, and with practice you will use them unconsciously. This is the essence of mastery, acquired through practice. It applies to thinking skills, but also to any other type of intelligence.Practically speaking, you have to decide what to focus your questions on. This will guide your practice and questions. Being smart or intelligent is only ever specific to a certain domain: it's kind of meaningless to compare the intelligence of an astro physicist with that of a footballer or a master shipwright. They have different personal histories.Your future personal history will be the product of the questions you ask yourself, and the practice you put in.

The infamous slogan to become confident.Have you ever wondered what is it, that you make in the above sentence?You make clarity.Once you are clear about something, you naturally seem confident.You don’t have to be confident. You just have to be clear.For example,Do you need to be confident or you need to see the road clearly?You just need to see the road clearly and simply cross the road.Similarly, let’s say you are an engineer. You just need to have clarity about how a machine or a code works to be a good engineer.Then you can modify the machine or the code in whichever way you want as per your specifications and requirements.Clarity is the direct result of intelligence.Intelligence arises in you the moment you realize that you know nothing.It is natural to be intelligent only if you are not told from childhood by everyone around you to live the life in ways they find it true.In this sense, the biggest destructor of intelligence is religion.So, how do you become intelligent very fast?I think you know the answer if you have read this far.
