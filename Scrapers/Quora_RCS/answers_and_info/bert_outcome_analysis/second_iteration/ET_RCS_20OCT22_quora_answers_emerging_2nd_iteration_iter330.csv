The high-level waste that usually gets media attention is in the form of solid fuel pellets inside zirconium rods, which after cooling for five years can be loaded into concrete and steel containers for transport or storage.If transported to any of the proposed storage or disposal sites in the arid southwest, there is essentially zero chance of it ever migrating into the environment. Compare that to the tons of toxic (and some radioactive) particulates and carbon dioxide that fossil plants discharge into our air, and it is clear nuclear fission is millions of times “greener” than fossil plants.The only real problem with high-level waste is the government's inability to meet its commitments for handling it. This flows from the widespread ignorance among the general public about radiation in general and the tendency of politicians to prey on that ignorance for short-term gain.Although fusion power plants would likely be cleaner than the old fission plants, we should not be reluctant to deploy what is already a million times better than what it would replace. Many of the new fission plant designs produce less (or no) high-level waste. Some are capable of burning the existing high-level waste for fuel. Many of the smaller new designs feature “inherent safety,” in that the meltdown scenario is not just unlikely, it is physically impossible.– Dwight B.Hi, Dwight, and thanks for sending in your note. Energy production is one of our favorite topics atAs a reminder for new readers, nuclearOf course, this has trade-offs. Fission creates nuclear waste that can poison our environment if it’s not properly stored. And many people associate this technology with high-profile nuclear meltdowns from fission reactors.In fact, I was living and working in Tokyo during the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima back in 2011. I sent my family to the southern part of Japan to be safe while I guided my company through the crisis.I had radiation meters in my office so that my team could understand that they were safe, and the radiation hadn’t spread to Tokyo. There were, however, periods when there was the risk of radiation clouds depending on the weather and winds, and when that happened we needed to stay inside.This was an unbelievable experience to have gone through. It was one that I could have never imagined. And it was all avoidable.There were terrible management failures on the part of the power company in Japan. This resulted in the reactors not being safely shut down in advance. And there were faults in the plant design that also could have been addressed sooner to prevent the meltdowns.So some people might be surprised to hear that I am not at all against nuclear fission. I believe nuclear fission is one of the few technologies that could get the world off fossil fuels, reduce carbon emissions, and provide baseload power for our electrical grids 24/7.In fact, third-generationfission reactor technology has been around since the ’90s. These designs are far safer and even more efficient than the reactors the U.S. currently has online. Yet these third-generationreactors are mainly being built in India and China, not here in the U.S.And fourth-generation fission reactor designs are even more economical and safer than third-generationreactors. Technologies like sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs), gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs), very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), pebble bed reactors, and molten salt reactors (MSRs) all show great promise.Nuclear fission technology is based on mature technology and releases no CO2 into the atmosphere. So why isn’t the entire Western world building third- and fourth-generation nuclear fission reactors?The answer is politics.Ignorance and negative emotions around nuclear fission technology are very real, even if these reactions aren’t based on logic. The media coverage and popular sentiment against fission technology tend to be visceral despite the technological advances.Yet those same people think that they are doing something good for the environment when they drive their electric vehicle that is fueled by electricity that comes from natural gas (carbon). It is completely absurd.Due to the “bad politics” of fission, I don’t believe that we will ever get the approvals to upgrade our infrastructure with modern, safe fission technology. This deeply saddens me because we have had a clean and carbon-free solution available for decades and we haven’t used it.We could have literally been at a stage of zero carbon emissions today had we simply adopted third-generationnuclear fission technology. And you are correct – there are safe ways to store the waste that is produced. There are even ways to use or recycle that waste in existing reactors.Fusion, on the other hand, is an easier sell to society. After all, it’s the power of the Sun. It is harder to argue against that. It’s the combination of two separate nuclei to form a new nucleus. In that process, huge amounts of energy are released. That’s why I’veMy favorite approach uses a proton-boron (pB-11) fuel. The advantage of using pB-11 is that the reaction produces no neutrons. The output is just three helium nuclei and a whole lot of clean energy. No radioactive waste at all.These advanced reactors are immensely complex. Yet with our advancements in materials science and artificial intelligence, we will be able to optimize the reaction for the best energy output.This will change the political debate entirely and put the world on a path to clean energy. And I can’t wait to see it happen. That’s why I’ll continue covering developments in this space as we head toward a world of completely clean energy - Jeff Brown.But he believes fission is doomed, anyway, asThe biggest nuclear fusion deal to date…Vancouver-based General Fusion just announced a major deal with the U.K.’s Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Per the partnership, General Fusion will build and operate a nuclear fusion reactor on the UKAEA’s Culham Campus.This is one of the most exciting developments in the industry to date. And General Fusion is one of the most promising companies in this space. I’ll explain why in a minute.But first, let’s bring newer readers up to speed on fusion technology.Nuclear fusion involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean. Unlike nuclearAnd there are different technological approaches to building nuclear fusion reactors. We don’t yet know if there will be one predominant way, but I’m excited that the industry is developing so many different approaches.General Fusion’s approach is called Magnetized Target Fusion. It entails generating a plasma reaction in a spherical reactor at extremely hot temperatures – temperatures that are hotter than the Sun.The reactors can be developed in a way so that they are compact. And they don’t take immense amounts of space and money to build. We can think of these compact reactors as being powerful enough to feed 100,000 homes.This would allow us to build a decentralized network of fusion reactors. That would in turn create an energy grid that is far more resilient than the more centralized power grid that is typical of what we see today.Of course, that’s if the technology can be deployed economically at scale.That’s why General Fusion’s deal with the UKAEA is so important. It will enable the company to build a reactor, get it up and running, and then assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs.If so, all that’s left to do is build more reactors. General Fusion would have no problem securing the funding it needs once its technology has been proven.In fact, the company already has an impressive list of backers, which includes Jeff Bezos – and yours truly. And I even got in at a better price than Bezos on this one.And perhaps most exciting, this deal is moving at an accelerated timeline. General Fusion will start building its reactor next year.From there, the company expects to have the reactor operational within three years. It should be fully functional by 2025.As we’ve discussed before,We are no more than a few years away from the first fusion reactors producing more energy than that required to power them. That means limitless, clean, and essentially “free” energy for all.","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-convert-nuclear-to-hydrogen-production-See-https-www-energy-gov-ne-articles-could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear-The-UKs-Hinkley-point-nuke-could-well-pioneer-this-technology-The-electricity-wont-be-needed-by

5,"The maximum velocity available directly from fission is in the range of 20 MeV neutrons. And that is isotropic, that is, in all directions. And the velocity of gasses from a bomb are significantly less, on the order of several thousand m/s or 1/10th an eV.The effectiveness of a propellant decreases as the velocity of the spacecraft increases. So some people have suggested trying to use the fission products directly as propellant. This suffers from several problems: at best you can harvest 50% of the power, and at best the exhaust is going perhaps 1% of light speed.

This suffers from several problems: at best you can harvest 50% of the power, and at best the exhaust is going perhaps 1% of light speed. For example, a Krypton atom with 120 MeV would have a (non relativistic corrected) velocity of 16 million m/s, or about 5% light speed.An Ion engine can send ions out at several tens of thousands of eV. The highest speed we could make would be in the hundreds of millions of eV, literally relativistic, and at those speeds, the craft could reach a significant percentage of light speed. Of course, that requires a lot of energy, and a way to concentrate it.The highest velocity we can conceive of getting would be done by using a nuclear power plant and a high energy particle accelerator. The highest velocity we could get would be by using the waste stream of a nuclear reactor, with the lightest fraction (the electrons) accelerated using all the energy it can provide. Since the ultimate heat sink is 3 K space, the power conversion efficiency can approach 100%; since an electron is very light, they will approach light speed (the non relativistic corrected velocity of an electron at 200 MeV would be over 8 billion m/s). The ions from the fission would simply be dumped to reduce the mass as the trip goes along. This system would approach adding energy from the fission to the kinetic energy of the ship. Even if it was only 10% efficient, the electron stream would STILL be exiting at nearly light speed.","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-convert-nuclear-to-hydrogen-production-See-https-www-energy-gov-ne-articles-could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear-The-UKs-Hinkley-point-nuke-could-well-pioneer-this-technology-The-electricity-wont-be-needed-by

8,"Because everything wants to be iron.With small, light elements, elements lighter than iron, the protons in a nucleus repel each other by electrostatic repulsion, but if you can overcome that repulsion and get them close enough, the strong nuclear force takes over and draws the protons together, fusing them into a new nucleus and releasing energy.But here’s the thing:The strong nuclear force isBecause everything wants to be iron.With small, light elements, elements lighter than iron, the protons in a nucleus repel each other by electrostatic repulsion, but if you can overcome that repulsion and get them close enough, the strong nuclear force takes over and draws the protons together, fusing them into a new nucleus and releasing energy.But here’s the thing:The strong nuclear force isWhen an atom gets too large, the proton repulsion overcomes the strong nuclear force, and eventually the nucleus flies apart, which also releases energy.But the closer you get to iron from the light side, the less energy you get from fusion, and the closer you get to iron from the heavy side, the less energy you get from fission.

9,"The core idea of nuclear fission works as following.Any radioactive substance, most commonly Uranium 233, 235, decays into Thorium, and releases neutrons. The neutrons can occasionally hit other Uranium nuclei, this repeats the process of decay again, and releases energy.

If, however, the reactor has a material which absorbs some extra neutrons, in a controlled environment. It does so with moderators and control rods which respectively slow down the speed of neutrons and absorb extra neutrons. This process of fission generates energy in the form of heat. The heat could be used to evaporate water and generate steam. The steam would then be used to turn a turbine. This turbine generates electricity. Generally the enrichment for a power reactor is commonly in the 3–5% range. Beyond that the fuel gets much more expensive to produce.One of the oldest designs still in use today is the RBMK. The reactor is graphite moderated and uses water as a coolant. The reactor has a positive void coefficient, which means its reactivity/the number of neutrons produced increases if unmaintained. If the void coefficient in a reactor is 0, it tends towards stability. The reactivity of nuclear reactors change as the void (eg - steam bubbles/effervescence) is created in the coolant and moderator. Other designs include LWR (Light Water Reactors) and PWR (Pressurised Water reactors) which uses water both as a coolant and a moderator. Generally, Generation 1 reactors are slowly being phased out and replaced with newer models. But we’re still waiting for the Gen 4 reactors to be realized and for greater innovation in the field.Many advances in nuclear physics have created designs such as Liquid Fluoride Thorium reactors (However still theoretical as far as i’m aware). These designs are innovative and bypass many of the problems which earlier designs had. Almost all nuclear reactors today utilise Uranium or Plutonium. The reasons for these are multitude, including the fact that manipulating Uranium for energy is far easier than other radioactive materials.A bit of a tangent but interestingly, the possibility of using Nuclear fission for power was once thought impossible. During the 1920s and 30s, science fiction had began to speculate about this “unlimited source of nuclear energy”. However scientists such as Schrodinger, Einstein, and Rutherford claimed it was impossible. Why was this the case? The problem was the Rutherford effect, if we wished for fission to occur, we need to cause a reaction in which the splitting of any single Uranium atom triggers the splitting of many others. This was thought impossible because neutrons had not been discovered yet. And the belief was that positively charged protons would scatter from the original source, i.e., away from any nuclei, because the nuclei had the same charge as the proton (Coulomb's reaction).This is Rutherford scattering, simply put. In 1920 Rutherford suggested a flaw in his model. Protons wouldn't combine with each other to form a nuclei higher than an atomic number of 1, hydrogen. This is because of Coulomb's law (protons repel each other). This is why him and many scientists were suggesting another atomic model to explain and update their current models to a new discovery, yet to come. The discovery of the neutron changed this, it had a neutral charge. Hence it would not be repelled when coming in contact with the nuclei of atoms. This discovery eventually led to the nuclear reactor.",1 follower,Daniel Weaver,2.5K,840,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-nuclear-fission-is-one-of-the-biggest-man-made-explosions-and-energy-would-it-mean-its-a-method-to-thrust-something-at-the-fastest-speed
10,"No. Not even a little bit. Where did you hear that it was?Nuclear fission is due to the strong nuclear force. It has to do with the binding energy in the nuclei of atoms, and how some of that energy is released when a heavy atom splits into multiple smaller atoms. The released energy can be in multiple forms - gamma rays and the kinetic motion of high-speed subatomic particles mostly - but it all turns into heat eventually.","51,641 followers",Chris Ebbert,1.1K,11.4K,277.7M,https://www.quora.com/If-nuclear-fission-is-one-of-the-biggest-man-made-explosions-and-energy-would-it-mean-its-a-method-to-thrust-something-at-the-fastest-speed
11,"Yes, it is possible to connect two fusion reactors (and there are times that would probably be useful).While tokamak fusion reactors are often popularly perceived by the public to produce continuous power, the reality is that current Tokamaks actually produce fusion power in pulses of up to a few hundred seconds.The requirement for continuous power at high availability is particularly demanding for the tokamak’s essentially pulsed output, albeit possibly operating in very-long-pulse mode (typically several hundreds of seconds).

Although researchers suggest that plasma motion and stability can be maintained for many hours after the initiating voltage sweep, there is a significant availability difference between long-pulse operations and a truly continuous operation.Much consideration has been given to the challenge of continuous operation of tokamaks. One approach to producing continuous fusion power could involve multiple tokamaks in a single power station. A future electrical utility that uses nuclear fusion might build two long pulsed tokamaks operating out of phase with each other to produce steam to drive a single turbogenerator set for continuous electricity production.D-D fusion produces with equal probability, either the light helium isotope with two protons and a neutron (He3) or the heaviest hydrogen isotope, tritium (T) with one proton and tow neutrons. Both reactions release energy, generally measured in millions of electron volts (MeV).D + D —> He3 + n + 3.2 MeVD + D —> T + p + 4.0 MeVThese reaction products can themselves react with deuterium and will either be “burned” in place or collected and burned in specialized reactors.D + T —> He4 + n + 17.6 MeVD + He3 —> He4 + p + 18.3 MeVBecause the fuel for the last two reactions is generated in the ﬁrst two, only deuterium needs be supplied externally. The ﬁnal reaction products — ordinary helium and hydrogen — are benign, but the energetic neutrons produced can damage and induce radioactivity (neutron activate) the structure of the reactor.The deuterium in a cubic meter of seawater contains the same amount of energy as 269 metric tons coal.Of all nuclear fuels, either fission or fusion, the fusion of pure Deuterium separated from sea water yields the highest energy per given mass.Energy Content Approximations for Nuclear Fuels",458 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-convert-nuclear-to-hydrogen-production-See-https-www-energy-gov-ne-articles-could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear-The-UKs-Hinkley-point-nuke-could-well-pioneer-this-technology-The-electricity-wont-be-needed-by

LLNL has made substantial progress in reducing optical damageUnderstanding Optics Damage from Reflected Laser LightLLNL has become more skillful at finding and repairing or changing out damaged optics at NIFNational Ignition Facility tops 400 shots in FY16Recently LLNL delivered a more advanced fast pulse laser called HAPLS to the ELI Beamlines Prague facility that greatly reduces the chance of damage to the active media while significantly increasing laser power to petawatt power levels.Lawrence Livermore-developed petawatt laser system installed at ELI BeamlinesNIF is and R&D research facility - first of kind ICF fusion technology. NIF is not a fusion power plant prototype. The problems that have surfaced at NIF are engineering issues that have good solutions. There are no ""show stopper"" issues with ICF that have surfaced so far.Fast pulse laser driver technology is getting simultaneously more reliable, cheaper, and higher power.The peak power attainable in a laser pulse has increased by roughly a factor of 1,000 every 10 years.High-power Lasers By Todd Ditmirehttps://www.americanscientist.org/article/high-power-lasershttps://www.americanscientist.org/article/high-power-lasersICF fusion faces geopolitical obstacles, because icf and fusion bombs are relatedHistorically, virtually every nuclear application can be traced back to a military project. A military origin should not stop sound peaceful application of fusion in a power generation context.The opportunity to use and develop ICF fusion is actually a protected right for all nations under international Treaty.In the Non Proliteration Treaty Article 5 each party to this treaty is guaranteed ""any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions"" on a nondiscriminatory basis (United Nations 1975, Article V).The corresponding article reads:NPT Article V""Each Party to this Treaty undertakes to take appro-priate measures to ensure that, in accordance withthis Treaty, under appropriate international observa-tion and through appropriate international proce-dures, potential benefits from any peaceful applica-tions of nuclear explosions will be made available tonon-nuclear-weapon States Party to this Treaty on anondiscriminatory basis and that the charge to suchParties for the explosive devices used will be as lowas possible and exclude any charge for research anddevelopment. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party tothe Treaty shall be able to obtain such benefits,pursuant to a special international agreement oragreements, through an appropriate internationalbody with adequate representation of non-nuclear-weapon States. Negotiations on this subject shall com-mence as soon as possible after the Treaty enters intoforce. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treatyso desiring may also obtain such benefits pursuant tobilateral agreements.""USPractical ICF Fusion is the only fusion reactor concept that has been successfully experimentally field tested (as components) and has been shown to make net energy today. Practical ICF Fusion Reactor uses a succession of small controlled nuclear bursts or explosions to produce commercially significant amounts of energy (Gigawatts level) reliably from fusion.Government leaders tend to reflect a perceived public preference for energy systems that promise to deliver smooth power instead of power produced in short controlled bursts. Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s on a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.) over the decades that have never once produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds), in part because MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power. Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion, on the other hand, produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare to some extent the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote any funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Further Predictions for fusion regarding commercial power plant reliability -Creating and maintaining fusion conditions in plasma will be difficult for the first several decades of commercial MCF fusion. Complex MCF power plants that have extreme materials issues and place high temperature components adjacent to cryogenically cooled components will break down at high frequency leading to power plant unreliability.ICF fusion power plants, on the other hand, only need to maintain fusion conditions for about 10 nanoseconds on each shot. This is essentially an easier technical challenge than creating and then maintaining fusion conditions indefinately.ICF fusion will succeed in greatly improving the efficiency of the laser driver (the LLNL HAPLS laser delivered to ELI Beamlines Prague uses solid state laser pumping technology instead of traditional flash lamps and that change makes the HAPLS laser about 30% efficient at converting electricity into laser light). ICF fusion target gain will also greatly improve with the introduction of two-stage ICF targets capable of fusion energy gain in excess of 300X.Picture of a 2-stage high gain energy yield DT-DD “mini-Mike” fusion deviceMCF fusion will tend to run in short irregular power generating spurts and produce unreliable power, perhaps lesss dependable than renewable wind power, when first implemented in a commercial power plant form.ICF laser fusion power plants will on the other hand produce clean reliable power from the very first generation of power plants and will demonstrate a reliability and power availability characteristic similar to or better than current Gen-III fission nuclear power plants.Fusion and the need for humility -Huge amounts of incredibly skillful creative design and innovation have been lavished on the problems involved in bringing to reality practical forms of nuclear fusion. I do not think we are currently at a point to confidently select winners. I think we should resist pressures to consolidate all efforts to producing fusion to only the two mainstream fusion approaches, While my personal background is in ICF fusion as a part of LLNL Field Test - Engineering. I do not want pretend that I am sure that the commercial fusion future belongs to ICF fusion (and not MCF, Polywell, Dense Plasma Focus, or some other dark horse fusion technology).I trust ICF because I have repeatedly been a part of LLNL technical teams that have practically demonstrated using it to reliably on demand produce fusion power.This does not however rule out the chance that some other fusion technology has a breakthrough and becomes an alternate basis for future commercial fusion power plants.No one today sees clearly enough to make a really good timeline for commercial fusion power plants coming into existence.Excessive pesimism on the near term prospects of nuclear fusion isThe fusion quest can be successfully achieved in a time frame that matters.","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-convert-nuclear-to-hydrogen-production-See-https-www-energy-gov-ne-articles-could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear-The-UKs-Hinkley-point-nuke-could-well-pioneer-this-technology-The-electricity-wont-be-needed-by

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1984 - 1988) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly and produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just theoretically predicted in computer simulations).Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion is different from Magnetic Confinement Fusion and other forms of fusion as ICF fusion has beenIf fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.------While wanting to avoid excessive controversy, I would like to point out the following historical facts.Ivy-Mike fission-fusion ICF technology worked the very first time it was tried in 1952.There was no gradual trail of experimental failures on the road to ICF fission-fusion leading to a final success after many experimental tries. Historically, ICF fission-fusion worked right from the first experimental attempt (Ivy-Mike test - 1952) and produced controlled reliable release of fusion energy with energy gain right from the first experiment.Ivy-Mike ICF fission-fusion technology has historicallyFission-fusion ICF technology was the basis of the first thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal. Adapting fission-fusion technology to be pure hybrid DT-DD fusion opens up many new applications in economical power generation.Fission-fusion technology worked the first time it was tried and produced huge amounts of net energy with engineering fusion gain not only greater than one but greater than 10^5 or 100,000X (and has never failed in over 800 underground tests at the Nevada Test Site).Rather than placing our faith in scaling laws while we build ever larger and more expensive MCF fusion experiments while trying to achieve break even energy generation -Why not go back to the field and adapt proven Inertial Confinement Fusion technology to operate as pure fusion, employing a modern fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) capable of delivering in excess of 20 MJ to the fusion capsule while avoiding use of a fission primary?Why not adapt and modify working ICF fusion technology that has never failed in the field rather than sink all current fusion funding into Magnetic Confinement Fusion approaches which in hundreds of MCF fusion devices around the world and in hundreds of thousands of shots has consistently failed to even once produce break-even fusion energy?References -NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -The following document contains what Senior LLNL researcher John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE“Development of the Indirect Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain” John Lindl.

And if we eventually develop a working, useful, nuclear fusion power plant, it still won’t be much use unless it makes cheaper electricity than existing nuclear fission power plants - which seems unlikely to me.","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/If-nuclear-fission-is-one-of-the-biggest-man-made-explosions-and-energy-would-it-mean-its-a-method-to-thrust-something-at-the-fastest-speed
28,I don’t think so because it will be too hard to control a large number of plants. There may be another accident in the soon future and it will set back nuclear fusion many years if it does happen.,"51,641 followers",Chris Ebbert,1.1K,11.4K,277.7M,https://www.quora.com/If-nuclear-fission-is-one-of-the-biggest-man-made-explosions-and-energy-would-it-mean-its-a-method-to-thrust-something-at-the-fastest-speed
