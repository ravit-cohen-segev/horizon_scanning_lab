1,"Yes I do, purely by accident, I was into solar and renewables well before I was into crypto-mining.So I have a 4kw array on my house, this can run a couple of mining rigs when the sun is up! My next addition will be a tesla powerwall which could in theory run a rig overnight too, but I need to over-produce enough power to charge up the battery too.I generally find Nvi...",0 followers,Mark Adler,2.5K,755,2M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-power-your-cryptocurrency-mining-rig-s-with-solar-power-How
2,"I just paid $12,000 to put 15 345 watt panels on my roof. I live on solar for the last 7 years in the desert. I love solar.People don’t see the benefit that I do. Government and utility companies put up barriers to solar that most people can’t get around. I was LIMITED to 15 panels when I could have afforded 30 because El Paso Electric won’t allow people to make money on the panels.I just paid $12,000 to put 15 345 watt panels on my roof.

3,"Bitcoin MiningI guess you understand what bitcoin mining is all about. For you to start mining bitcoin, you must own a bitcoin mining rig. Although in the beginning, Miners used computers, machines, graphic cards but they all consume alot. Today it is very slow or impossible to mine bitcoin in such ways.There is a special hardware designated for mining bitcoin called ASIC [Application-Specific Integrated Circuit Chip] which mines bitcoin faster and requires less energy but very costly and complex to develop ASICs as mining devices.i would recommend you work on trading and investing bitcoin whiBitcoin MiningI guess you understand what bitcoin mining is all about.

6,"About 6 years ago I installed solar panels on my vacation home in the mountains. The utility company had a deal where they would pay for half the cost of the system, up to a certain amount, and then there were state and federal rebates. I called a solar provider and they installed the maximum amount of panels I could get and stay within the utility rebate guidelines, which turned out to be 13,000 nameplate watts. The whole system cost less than $8,000 after all the rebates were considered. Once each year the utility company “zeroes” out my account and credits me for the power they have bankedAbout 6 years ago I installed solar panels on my vacation home in the mountains. The utility company had a deal where they would pay for half the cost of the system, up to a certain amount, and then there were state and federal rebates. I called a solar provider and they installed the maximum amount of panels I could get and stay within the utility rebate guidelines, which turned out to be 13,000 nameplate watts. The whole system cost less than $8,000 after all the rebates were considered. Once each year the utility company “zeroes” out my account and credits me for the power they have banked from me but that I have not used. As a result, I think my total electric bill actual payments since I installed the system have been less than $200 total for 6 years. My monthly bill used to be $100-$150. Plus, I switched from propane heat to electric and from a gas water heater to electric, and where I used to burn $500 - $1000 propane each winter, now it is basically zero.So I would say that if you design the system correctly, solar panels are 100% effective in reducing power bills.At another property, the local utility charges a “demand” charge for use during peak hours of 3pm-8pm. Now 3pm-5pm in the summer is the hottest part of the day. So I installed a small number of panels to keep the demand charge low and so I can still cool the house cheaply during those times. A modest investment in panels (3000 watts) lets me run my AC and keep the demand charge low. The demand charge is around $20 per KWH during peak times, so my 3kw panel setup saves maybe $50 a month, plus another $0.12/kwH for an average savings of $60 or so a month, so maybe $100-$120 off the bill for a 3KW setup which cost about $5,000 after rebates (and doing the work myself), and so they will pay for themselves in 50 months or a little over 4 years.

7,"They are already using it if they buy their electrical energy from the grid which more and more is using different forms of solar energy in the mix of sources. Wind, and hydropower are minimally delayed forms of energy from the sun, not only PV and Thermal solar. That wind was generated by the sun’s heating of the ocean water and the wind and clouds together gave the mountains their snowmelt.But maybe you mean why do they not use more PV on the roofs of their factories and office buildings.

8,"Conceptually, it doesn’t seem like Bitcoin should require enormous amounts of electricity. All you have to do is point and click or tap on your smartphone to buy and sell the cryptocurrency.

All you have to do is point and click or tap on your smartphone to buy and sell the cryptocurrency. And we’ve had electronic networks that do much the same for other sorts of digital transactions for decades.But it’s Bitcoin’s decentralized structure that drives its huge carbon emissions footprint. That’s because to verify transactions, Bitcoin requires computers to solve ever more complex math problems. This is the basic concept that the cryptocurrency world refers to as a “proof-of-work” system, and it’s drastically more energy intensive than verifying transactions on centralized networks.“In the case of Bitcoin, this is done by having many different competitors all conduct a race to see how quickly they can package the transactions and solve a small mathematical problem,” says Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at EY. The fastest computer not only certifies the transaction, but it also gets a small reward for its trouble in the form of a Bitcoin payment.In Bitcoin’s early days, this process didn’t consume nation-state amounts of electricity. But it’s inherent to the cryptocurrency’s technology for the math puzzles to become much, much harder as more people compete to solve them—and this dynamic will only accelerate as more people attempt to buy into Bitcoin.To combat this, more and more specialized computers, called rigs, are entering the fray, pouring huge amounts of computational and electrical energy into the ecosystem in the race to be the first to solve Bitcoin math puzzles and get the associated prize. That means even though there may be hundreds of thousands of computers racing to solve the same problem, only one can ultimately receive the Bitcoin honorarium.“Of course, this is wasteful in the sense that 99.99% of all the machines that did work just throw away the result since they didn’t win the race,” says Brody. While this process produces a fair and secure result, it also creates a ton of carbon emissions. “I very much doubt [whoever founded] Bitcoin anticipated such enormous success in the future and, consequently, the enormous amounts of power we’re talking about,” says Brody.This process also takes an immense amount of time: Upwards of 10 minutes per Bitcoin transaction. Other digital transactions, like those powered by Visa, take less than a second and use roughly 1/500,000 the energy because they rely on a centralized authority to verify transactions.What Can Be Done?Solving Bitcoin’s near-continent-sized energy consumption problem doesn’t require returning to centralized systems, like Visa’s network—after all, the central promise of Bitcoin is the elimination of middlemen like the card networks and their concentrated power over finance. Instead, Bitcoin’s advocates have more than a few options.Switch to Renewable EnergyCurrently, an estimated 39% of proof-of-work mining is performed using renewable energy. So perhaps the most obvious path to a green future for Bitcoin is simply upping that figure.Countless startups have emerged to address this gap, each targeting new ways to bring more environmentally friendly energy to Bitcoin. Take Hong Kong-based LiquidStack, which aims to more efficiently lower the temperature of mining rigs, or Genesis Mining in Iceland, which exclusively uses renewable energy sources.These solutions, however, fail to address that even if all energy pumping into the Bitcoin industrial complex were green, at large scale its proof-of-work verification technology is inherently wasteful.Transition to Proof-of-Stake SystemsCryptocurrencies could move from proof-of-work systems to “proof-of-stake” systems that don’t require this same mad dash to solve complex puzzles, says eToro cryptocurrency market analyst Simon Peters.Put simply, proof-of-stake requires miners to front a small amount of cryptocurrency to be entered into a lottery for the chance to verify transactions. The thought is that if you’re putting up some amount of value as collateral, you’re less likely to approve fraudulent transactions that would devalue the currency and cost you your stake.Because proof-of-stake systems remove the competitive computational element of proof-of-work, “it saves energy and allows each machine in a PoS to work on one problem at a time, as opposed to a PoW system, in which an array of machines are rushing to solve the same problem (thus wasting energy),” says Peters.Ethereum the blockchain system powering Ether and most NFTs, already has plans to transition to a proof-of-stake system. This will dramatically reduce the energy consumption of Ethereum-based cryptos and blockchains by an estimated 99.5%.Embrace Pre-MiningTo avoid the wasteful computing involved in solving math problems quickly to earn digital coins, some cryptos have introduced pre-mining, a system that functionally works much like fiat currency or stocks. A central authority, like the U.S. government (in the case of dollars) or a company (in the case of stocks), creates a set amount of an item and then carefully releases it into the economy depending on what’s going on in the world or their business.Pre-mined cryptos work the same way.“Several other cryptoassets like XRP [also popularly referred to as Ripple] weren’t mined at all but were instead produced algorithmically,” says Peters. “This eliminates the need for dedicated high-speed mining equipment.”In these systems, transactions are still verified by a decentralized network of validators before they’re added to the currency’s blockchain record, but those involved in the transaction may have to pay a small transaction fee to compensate the validators for their effort since the currency system itself doesn’t always reward them. In the case of XRP, this fee is a fraction of a cent currently.Transitioning Bitcoin to a proof-of-stake or pre-mined system wouldn’t be easy: To fundamentally alter the Bitcoin protocol someone would have to convince the majority of miners to agree to the new system, a tough ask when billions are at stake and the existing system works, if slowly and electrically inefficiently. The last time a change of this magnitude happened, it was not accepted universally by miners, resulting in a so-called “hard fork” that created a separate cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash, which itself later hard forked into Bitcoin SV, among others.Introduce Carbon Credits or FeesCarbon credits represent the government-sanctioned ability for a company to emit a certain amount of carbon emission into the environment. They’re often securitized, meaning they can be traded to by companies that don’t need to produce a lot of emissions to other companies that do. This incentivizes a company to produce less than its allotment—as well as penalizes those that go over. In the case of a crypto mining company, this might mean it purchases carbon credits from another company to help offset the amount of emissions it creates or switches to greener energy so it can earn a profit from selling its credits.“These are a tried-and-true method under a variety of programs like the Clean Air Act to get to net-zero emissions for products.",0 followers,Mark Adler,2.5K,755,2M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-power-your-cryptocurrency-mining-rig-s-with-solar-power-How
