It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI asWhat you see below the screen is the RSI indicator. It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI as it’s falling from point 1 to point 2. Now the question is “Why the heck it the price going up but the RSI falling down?”.Well this is called Divergence. The real reason that this divergence showed up here is that the big (smart) money pulled out of the market at point 1 (Either all of the big smart money or a big chunk of it). Then after point 1 the price decreased for two weeks as you can see on the chart. Now that the big whales are out, the small fish came swimming and put their money in so the price goes up to point 2 but there’s a difference between price reaching point 1 and price reaching point 2. The difference is that for example 10 rich whales invested 10 billion dollars in bitcoin so it reached point 1, then they pulled out their money and the small fish came to play so 100,000 normal people invested 10 billion in bitcoin and it rose again to point 2. Do you see the difference? 10 rich smart whales don’t panic, they know what they’re doing, but 100,000 average traders who are looking to make a quick buck will panic with the first sign of danger. so from point 1 to point 2 those big whales pulled out of the market so slow and subtle that those fish didn’t suspect a thing. They kept buying the overpriced bitcoin and the whales were happy to sell at the top. One red candle shows up, the fish panic and sell like crazy and the rest is history.That divergence is the real reason why the prices dropped but there’s no reason to panic. Heavy drops are good for the market. The funny part is that now while the fish are panicking and selling their valuable assets those whales would enter again and buy the cheap coins to get ready for the $100k bitcoin (remember bitcoin dropped from $20k to $3200 to get ready for the $40k, $50k and $60k.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,735,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-evolutions-or-upgrades-does-Bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-require-to-solve-its-current-drawbacks

But he quickly deleted this tweet.However, Elon Musk's ""operations"" are indeed incomprehensible: Do you support cryptocurrency or oppose it? He said that he would let Dogecoin rise to the moon, and then he said that Dogecoin is a hustle; then he announced that Tesla would accept Bitcoin as a payment method, and then he revoked it, saying that Bitcoin energy consumption is too great. In line with Tesla's image of energy saving and environmental protection.These are all on the surface, and privately, they are determined by the ""two-layer struggle"" that Elon Musk is carrying out. And Elon Musk is using the power of the cryptocurrency market and fans to win these two wars.The cryptocurrency market will also undergo earth-shaking changes due to the battle of the new leader.Two warsThose who are familiar with Musk know that in addition to two very high-profile companies, Musk has been engaged in two wars, and these two wars have never ceased.Since Tesla and SpaceX are two companies that have almost no profit but are very money-consuming, Musk has been facing financing pressure.Remember Musk's cry in 2018? Musk tearfully reviewed the tremendous pressure he faced in the past. He believes that the past year has been the ""difficult and painful year"" of his career, largely because of Tesla's short positions.As an industrial capitalist, Musk is most afraid of financial capitalists. Tesla has also been relying on financial capital to survive to this day: In 2004, Musk led Tesla’s A round investment, and only used less than 7.5 million US dollars of personal funds to become the company’s largest shareholder (Musk’s shares is currently worth 100 billion dollars , the ""cost"" is no more than 10 million);After Musk ""led"" the round A investment, he soon led Tesla's $13 million round B investmentinvestment and soon in 2006, Musk jointly led the $40 million round C investment. Because of the rapid cash burn, in 2007 Musk led the fourth round of financing of 45 million US dollars, this time the two Google founders were persuaded to participate.Soon in 2008, Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy. Musk persuaded Daimler to exchange $50 million for a 10% stake in Tesla, and then he pulled Tesla back from the cliff of bankruptcy.Then in 2010, Toyota was persuaded to also provide Tesla with about $50 million in financing.In 2009, the US Department of Energy provided Tesla with a low-interest loan of US$465 million through the ""High-tech Vehicle Production Credit Project."" The loan provided by the US Department of Energy has played a further role in leveraging private capital. On June 29, 2010, Tesla conducted an IPO on Nasdaq, raising US$226 million from the public at a price of US$17 per share.In 2013, Tesla raised US$1.02 billion from the capital market (including US$660 million in bonds), and fully repaid the previous loan of the US Department of Energy; in 2014, it raised another US$2 billion to build a factory; in 2015, Elon Musk built a Model X stock raised US$738 million; in 2016, it raised another US$1.46 billion for Model3. After so many rounds of financing, Musk has always been Tesla's largest shareholder.In 2018, Tesla was shorted by the capital market. Musk ""cried"". The whole person was on the verge of collapse. No financing and being shorted meant that when Tesla was about to bear fruit, he would give in to financial capital and surrender control. right. (Financial capital controls the industry, the normal way is to provide financing and gradually gain control; in the case of unable to obtain control, it usually means that you lose the financing ability, and finally have to sell at a low price. Financial capital comes back to buy, and then gains Control) This is as painful as raising one's own child and then giving it to others for free.At the same time, Musk began to release ""fake news"" about privatization, which was ""tracked"" by US regulators. Since then, Musk has gotten into trouble with U.S. regulation. ""Iron Man"" himself can’t tell: I’m overseeing you to sit and watch this group of financial capital for shorting, and you will rob me of the fruits of my labor. I will fight back, but you will punish me!The ""weapon"" of the currency circleAlthough Musk survived after that, he himself knew that one day financial capital would make a comeback. There are still a bunch of people who are looking to short and waiting for opportunities to short Tesla. Tesla is still not strong enough to make money and falsify everything.So the currency circle, independent of the existing financial system, provides Musk with a ""way out.""The first thing that Musk tested was Bitcoin. After eating Bitcoin at a low price, Musk began to sing more on Twitter, which has 50 million followers.Musk posted Bitcoin-related content on Twitter on December 20, 2020 (the market value of Bitcoin was only $200 million at that time)Subsequently, on January 29, Musk changed his entire Twitter ""introduction"" to Bitcoin.Figure: On January 29th, after Musk changed his Twitter, Bitcoin jumped by US$800 in a short-term, which was as high as US$32,000.Musk has tasted the sweetness of financing on Bitcoin. Tesla's subsequent ""announcement"" showed that as of March 31, 2020, the fair market value of the company's bitcoin holdings was 2.48 billion U.S. dollars; this means that if the company cashes out the cryptocurrency, it is expected to record about 1 billion Investment income in US dollars.On March 31, the Bitcoin price closed at $59,000, and $1 billion of the $2.48 billion market value was profitable, indicating that the average cost of Tesla's Bitcoin holdings was only less than $25,000 per unit.In other words, before Musk longed bitcoins, he had already ""ambushed"" him.Because of Bitcoin, Tesla also created the highest quarterly profit in history in the first quarter of this year: 440 million U.S. dollars, of which the sale of Bitcoin brought in a ""profit"" of 100 million U.S. dollars, but the sale of the car lost more than 100 million. The profit comes from the sale of carbon credits.Musk, who enjoyed the sweetness of Bitcoin, also set his sights on the little-known Dogecoin. Before Musk cheered for it, the unit price of Dogecoin was only about $0.004, and now it has risen to a maximum of nearly $0.75. In fact, it has risen by a maximum of nearly 200 times in more than a year.After that, Musk announced that he would use Dogecoin financing to launch a lunar satellite next yearCan Dogecoin really ""release satellites""? of course can! If you have enough low-cost Dogecoins in your hand, you can raise enough funds to launch some by selling some.Musk is actually saying that SpaceX holds a lot of Dogecoin and has already raised a lot of money with Dogecoin.How much does it cost to put a satellite on the moon? The NASA space shuttle LEO, which was retired in 2011 and has a lunar carrying capacity, cost $450 million per launch at that time. The current cost plus satellites is estimated to be at least $1 billion or more.According to the market price of US$0.4/Dogecoin, 1 billion US dollars can be easily done by selling about 2.5 billion Dogecoins. It is said to be ""easy to do"" because the total amount of Dogecoin is as high as 130 billion, and it will increase steadily by 5 billion every year. And Dogecoin's holdings are very concentrated. There is an address that is suspected to be controlled by Musk, and the holdings are as high as 40 billion!Musk is winning the ""war""Through cryptocurrency, Musk allowed Tesla and SpaceX to achieve financing freedom.Then why fight against Bitcoin and Dogecoin?This is also related to the ""two wars"".When financing is needed, the market is in a bull market, and it is easiest to get financing; when financing is not needed temporarily, it is best to be a bear market, otherwise the money in the market will be raked by speculators.At the same time, if longing cryptocurrencies on one side, he will be targeted by regulators. After Musk longed Dogecoins, he was warned by the regulators, and his Twitter account was stopped for a while.Therefore, in a half-joking and half-serious way, fighting each other's statements and practices is the best way to make the supervision ""nothing to say""-I'm kidding, this won't work! ?The next time Musk controls the 8 companies, which one is ""short of money"" and needs financing, Musk will most likely stand up and shout out the cryptocurrency he holds.This financing method can not only get rid of the control and mocking of financial capitalists, but also easily raise money. Why not?And Musk’s fans are also happy to support him, because after he gets the money, he is different from other “little leaders” in the cryptocurrency circle to buy luxury houses, drive luxury cars, and give birth to a bunch of children. He wants to change the destiny of mankind and let mankind be an interstellar race. This couldn't help but make other ""little leaders"" start to doubt life and start to think: What do I want to do for mankind? In the future, the currency circle will be because of Musk, there will be more ""saviors"" who will change the destiny of mankind, or at least the destiny of others.","8,614 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-evolutions-or-upgrades-does-Bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-require-to-solve-its-current-drawbacks

The price of purchasing half the revenue stream discounted at 6.4% over 30 years is half the net present value or;6.05*(1–1/1.064^30)/0.064 = $79.83 billionTo be expended over the next five years to get bitcoin carbon emissions to zero.Development program by month totals;Total disbursements by month over 60 month install (millions USD$.){334.891,As part of this program there is investment in 2 nm feature size which reduces power consumption to 1% of today’s power consumption.Smaller features mean more computations per watt.Features get smaller over time. .Drive voltage drops with feature length drop while speed rises…Capacity rises over time.Faster clocks for the same power using smaller features.As feature size diminishes, interconnection becomes a problem, yet that is addressed using 3d architecture — more here:https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/moores-law-ends-samsung-releases-3d-ic-technology/So, we commit to miners to provide power and also next generation mining engines. There is also a ‘end of mining’ or ‘post-mining’ protocol that I have developed that sells encryption and security services using native block chain features delivered over a global wireless network like StarLink using handsets and computing platforms native to that link.","135,200 followers",Hector Quintanilla,27.8K,1.2K,88.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-mine-cryptocurrency-on-old-graphics-cards-like-the-Afox-GT-730-4GB-LP-card-and-actually-make-money

You need a lot of computing power and the best way is actually running this through video cards, stacked up in multiple racks. This is called farming, or mining sometimes. And this is a bitcoin farm.When Genesis Mining started up from scratch to get into this business, they chartered a couple of Boeing 747 freighters and filled them up with tens of thousands of video cards to fly them to their mining farms, to be able to compete.These farms cost thousands of dollars a day just to get enough energy to run all the equipment.Not very environmentally friendly this.","69,771 followers",Marius Kramer,5.3K,2K,192.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-evolutions-or-upgrades-does-Bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-require-to-solve-its-current-drawbacks
27,"Yes. Because each bitcoin transaction requires a tremendous amount of computing power, each Bitcoin transfer uses enough energy to run a comfortable house, and everything in it, for nearly a week.
