After 1971 no country has the gold standard, all are replaced by something else entirely: trust.The reason why dollar, euro, yen or any other currency is valuable is because certain entites make it the legal tender, a way to settle taxes and debts within their borders and because you trust those governments not to do something stupid about it, such as print too many of those notes, to make them just wads of paper.Cryptocurrency is like that, it‚Äôs a hash file and not a paper, but otherwise identical to other fiat currencies - but without the backing of a state. The only reason why they‚Äôre valuable is because you can find other people who will buy them, in hopes there will be even more people who will buy them to drive the price up.

This will be a significant step in changing the financial system. The Chinese authorities are actively introducing many modern technologies into the everyday life of their citizens, so it can be expected that at least within the country, crypto-yuan will quickly spread in accordance with the party‚Äôs plans.For other countries, 2020 should be the year of the release of their own digital currencies. Most likely, they will appear after crypto yuan.The appearance of CBDC on the state agenda was mainly due to the recognition of the potential of cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins. Organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have repeatedly said that central banks should start developing their own cryptocurrencies.In the future, we can expect a single global digital currency. In October 2019, the Bank for International Settlements held the first G20 Central Banks summit to discuss the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa global cryptocurrency. In Switzerland, the Bank for International Settlements, together with the Central Bank of the country, has already created a center for the development of a single settlement token among the world Central Banks.All of the above facts tell us that the transition of states to digital currencies is one of the elements of the next stage in the development of mankind.

Below, we take a simplified look at how cryptocurrencies like bitcoin work. Let's start with the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. A cryptocurrency is really no more than a digital or virtual token that represents a particular asset or utility. Cryptocurrencies are built on a blockchain, which is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records all transactions that take place on the network.Essentially, a blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is constantly growing as ""completed"" blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.",0 followers,Steph Brooks,893,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency

However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market ‚Äì which had been crashing since January ‚Äì started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since ‚Äì between $2 and $2.8.The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.What is happening to EOS these days?Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part ‚Äî EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.Wallet Investor also expects the currency‚Äôs price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025.",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,1.1K,54,909.5K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency

You could live off a little of your capital while getting some training, or work for someone else to gain experience. If you are honest with people, some will give you a chance.Food stalls and even coffee stalls that go to festivals (e.g. music festivals) often do really well (I know as I‚Äôve recently helped run a festival). The costs to set up at each event can be high, and you may be at the mercy of the weather which means that on some occasions you may not cover your costs, but people always want to eat and drink, and when you have (as we did several weeks ago) 70,000 people funneling into a small town over the course of a weekend, the potential sales are massive. You can work for 2 or 3 days non-stop (and maybe pay a teenager or college kid to be your sidekick), spend the rest of the week cleaning up and recovering, and really make a good wage.One business that I saw in action at the festival basically consisted of a coffee machine in a converted horse-box (horse trailer for a single horse)! A horse-box, a coffee machine and a teenage girl doing most of the selling, and they took a couple of thousand ¬£ over 2 days!Take a look around and see what works - what you could do better or differently. Begin with something relatively small and low-risk. (And don‚Äôt take out financing or spend $50,000 on a truck to haul your trailer. Start cheaply, and pay cash!)Personally, I‚Äôd be wary of just opening a shop and sinking all of your funds into stock (e.g. clothing, gifts, whatever). Businesses can backfire, and often take longer to establish than you might think. At the very least you‚Äôd need a cushion to see you through the early stages (two years minimum).Or why not buy a readymade business from somebody who is selling up, such as a convenience store or - if you have a particular interest - something like a fishing tackle shop? That way, you would have an existing customer base.Make sure that the books and finances are in order, and that the business is really viable, i.e. you have enough customers in the local area.Or you could take a couple of years to get some training and set up something like your own car repair shop, paint spraying, welding, mobile servicing engineer - whatever you feel you‚Äôd like to do.Thinking more laterally, you could buy a vehicle and offer wedding car services, be a limo driver, etc.Just make sure that whatever you do is something you‚Äôll be competent at. Get good advice, and don‚Äôt invest in scams. (Particularly not the type of people who want you to pay them $50,000 to ‚Äúlearn about the next level of property investing‚Äù, or some such hype.)I wish you well!PS just remembered: I used to work for a woman in her camping gear shop, but she started out selling outdoor clothing at festivals, particularly the agricultural shows and country fairs.

I am a veteran Bitcoin (and altcoin) miner of 7 years, since the start of crypto pretty much, I used to mine solo, but cloud mining has been the answer for me as far as a living income.BetweenWhen you choose a cloud mining pool, you are making a smart choice because you will be mining more efficiently as a pool. You won't have dents in income from downtime and so on. It's a hot start, with income coming in the very first day and you will make profit in line with your investment. You can scale up pretty easily if you aren't able to afford much to start with.Mining a variety of coins allows you to have backup income streams rather than relying on one coin's value. Of course, the freedom is what really sold me on it all, now I don't have the headaches of ownership. All I do is log in, even on mobile, and check on my coins etc. Crypto won't go away and established cloud mining services add new, reliable coins to their selection often so you can pick what you mine for best results.I consider myself wealthy now but I didn't start out that way as a solo miner, mining Bitcoin in my room in a rental shared apartment!

This is one of the best and easiest ways to focus on how to make money in cryptocurrency.For example Bitcoin was worth around $13 in 2013, and at the most peak price we‚Äôve seen so far was nearly $20,000 in 2018.If you‚Äôd like to know how to make money with cryptocurrency by using buying and holding, we have some articles ready for you so you can get your coins and get started!How to buy bitcoinHow to buy liteconHow to buy ethereumHow to buy rippleWhile there are MANY different coins out there, we recommend you stick to the 4 mentioned above. These are the safest and have been around for a while. If you invest in a new coin it might be cheap to buy lots of them, but there‚Äôs a very high chance the coin could just disappear. Coins that have been around a while don‚Äôt have that same risk.If you‚Äôre ready to buy, we recommend that you visit Coinbase, which has been ranked as the most ‚Äúbeginner friendly‚Äù exchange.‚Äì 2 ‚ÄìBuy and hold for dividendsThe strategy and currencies above will pay you when you eventually sell at a higher price than when you bought. However, some currencies will actually pay you just for holding them, which makes this a very lucrative method of making money You don‚Äôt actually purchase or own the cryptocurrency‚Ä¶you simply hold it and keep it in circulation. Some examples of these coins are:‚Äì 3 ‚ÄìStaking cryptocurrenciesThis strategy combines the first two we mentioned: you buy a currency, hold it, plan to sell it for a profit at a later time, AND you also receive dividends from just holding it. This is a great secret in making money with cryptocurrency.Some examples of these currencies are:‚Äì 4 ‚ÄìMiningWhen considering how to make money with cryptocurrency, mining is one of the methods that always comes up. Mining cryptocurrency is one of the best ways to make money with altcoins as it‚Äôs extremely passive:But there‚Äôs the only possible issue‚Ä¶investing in the equipment. While you can mine cryptocurrency without extremely high end hardware, the better the hardware, the faster it can create more coins for you and the better your chance of actually making money. Mining works by having computers solve complex mathematical problems, and when they solve them, you are rewarded with cryptocurrency.The thing is that as more cryptocurrency is created, the problems get harder and harder, and so if you don‚Äôt have a high end system, it can take a LONG time to solve things. You might also need cooling units, extra electricity upgrades, and more to support all this.Also MANY different people are trying to solve the same problem at the same time. If your computer is too slow and someone else solves the problems first, you get nothing, so investing in a high end system is almost always needed.‚Äì 5 ‚ÄìDay tradingThis method is a bit more advanced and involves looking for patterns in financial trading charts every day. Because cryptocurrency is very volatile in that the price can change drastically over a day, someone who constantly tracks the price over a day can make a very large return on investment by buying some coins in one hour, and selling them an hour later.We wouldn‚Äôt recommend this if you‚Äôre a beginner, or if you don‚Äôt want to follow charts every single day. If this sounds like you, it would be better to consider the other options. But if you have experience in trading or previous knowledge in crypto, this could be‚Äì 6 ‚ÄìMicrotasksIf you‚Äôre wondering how to make money in cryptocurrency, you should consider microtasks. These are small services you do for someone and you receive payment in cryptocurrency. You might fill out an online survey, test an app, debug a website, or something similar.Cointasker estimates that a single microtask will, on average, pay out 0.00001426BTC, or around $0.90 (as of July 2018), for around 10 minutes of work.Some websites where you can find lists of microtasks that pay out in cryptocurrency are:You can also apply for freelancing jobs on sites like Upwork, and ask to be paid in cryptocurrency. Be sure if you do this that you respect the terms of service and rules of the site though.‚Äì 7 ‚ÄìWork for cryptocurrencyAs we mentioned in the microtasks section, many employers are happy to pay for work in cryptocurrency. If youBlogs that are specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency are also happy to pay writers who want to work in crypto as well.Here are some sites you can browse:‚Äì 8 ‚ÄìCurrency and exchange arbitrageCryptocurrency exchanges are simply online platforms that allow you to make accounts, and login to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. But, the price of a currency in one exchange might be different to that in another, and the prices of all the currencies are also always changing.By tracking these numbers you can make a profit: You might buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. You could also buy one cryptocurrency and then invest into another that has a lower dollar per coin value. This way you‚Äôd own more coins overall with the hope of the higher number of coins making you a profit compared to if you had stayed with the other coins, and owned less of them.‚Äì 9 ‚ÄìFaucetsYou should know that there are various apps and websites that offer bitcoins as a reward for completing a designated task. These websites or apps are known as bitcoin faucets and there are thousands of them online. The only catch is that the amount of bitcoins they give is very small, and it varies from 100 Satoshis (0.000001 BTC) to 10,000 Satoshis (0.0001 BTC).The tasks you usually complete range from things like clicking on ads, watching videos, and filling out surveys. Here are a list of bitcoin faucets you can look at.‚Äì 10 ‚ÄìAffiliate marketingIf you own a website or business, this might be a good way of making some extra money. In simple terms, affiliate marketing is where you‚Äôre paid a commission when someone from your website clicks a link of another company, and purchases one of their products. If the company offers payouts in coins, you can choose this instead of getting paid in cash.‚Äì 11 ‚ÄìTrading botsFor strategies like day trading, you need to be looking at charts and your computer constantly, manually buying and selling when you think the time is right. This involves a lot of work using your own brain to come up with predictions based on the data‚Ä¶not to mention staring at complex financial charts for hours on end. When you‚Äôre still figuring out how to make money with cryptocurrency, this can definitely be exhausting and tedious.As with most things in the world today, this process has been automated in a great way: computers can perform thousands of calculations much faster than you or I, and use algorithms as well as data science to predict crypto pricing strategies.By investing in a crypto trading bot, you can have something automatically buying and selling at the right time based on thousands of data points instead of having to manually guess or look at a screen 24 hours a day. The bot will do the trading for you.","358,061 followers",Sean Kernan,5.5K,5.6K,722.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency
