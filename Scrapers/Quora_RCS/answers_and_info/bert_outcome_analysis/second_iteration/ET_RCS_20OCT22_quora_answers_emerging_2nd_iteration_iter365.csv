There is not enough resources in the world to meet an American or even a Western European type lifestyle for all humans in the world.Technology improvements needed include moving away from carbon as the major energy source [solar is already close to replacing carbon in a number of countries]. And producing artificial meat, as there is nowhere enough space to rear cattle or chicken for 7 billion people.Ultimately, we need to look to scale down our wants and needs as we don't need most of them.

The resource of the earth are absolutely enough for several times as many humans as there are alive today to enjoy a standard of living far higher than anyone knows today. Getting there would take technological breakthroughs in the way we extract resources and get cheap energy because we aren't very good at using those resources right now.The mass of the Earth is 5.972 x 10^21 tons. The amount of iron mined in a year is around around 3 X 10^9 tons. Obviously the entire earth is not made of iron and there are many other resources we need. But we can see that the amount we are using is very small. And even then we're not always extracting it efficiently or getting all of it. I won't consider the possibility of synthesizing or recycling resource as the existing amount is already much more than we use.Any advancement that makes critical resources cheaper or more efficient to extract would vastly increase the amount we have to work with. Aluminum used to cost thousands of times as much as it does now before better extraction processes were invented.Of course all of this needs energy. According to some claims, we are using about 0.01% of the energy that the sun sends to the Earth currently. That's also not counting geothermal energy coming from the core of the Earth and other forms of stored energy such as atomic energy (which is a potentially vast amount since a small amount of the right elements produces a lot of energy).I'm not sure if there is some other way to capture additional energy, for example through tides (generated by the lunar orbit) or by using the motion of the Earth through magnetic fields to capture energy (using the planet as a large generator).And I'm not going into space-based resource gathering since we don't really do it at all now. That could potentially multiply the amount of certain resources that are available to us.We are surrounded by a vast amount of resources or energy. We are literally only scratching the surface of the Earth to get what we need and it's not like we're shooting a lot of stuff into space so we can figure out how to re-use resources when it makes sense. If we knew how to get even a fraction of what we are aware of now we wouldn't know what to do with it (but give it 100 years and I'm sure we can get creative). And over time we may discover other ways of accessing and using resources that we can't even imagine now.To not get too utopian here, all of this comes at a cost. The cost of extracting, producing, and transporting resources can be brought back to energy. So cheaper energy means that every resource is easier to get to including more energy. Currently fossil fuels are one of the cheapest, most widely-available, and most reliable ways to get energy.Thomas Malthus was one of the most famous predictors of our doom due to limited resource. He happened to live around the start of the industrial revolution that kicked off the greatest growth in humanity and wealth ever seen in history. Looking back now we can only agree on one thing -- the way we used resources at that time was incredibly primitive and wouldn't support a large population. Fortunately that changed very quickly. Who knows what will happen in another 200 years?We will need technological and societal advancement to see this happen. The good news is that having a higher population density tends to make advancements happen faster. Bringing up the standard of living in all countries as the global population grows means that we have more minds to raise the standard of living. That is the ultimate resource. Without our intelligence and the productivity we got through trade we would be huddling around a fire using sticks to fend off predators.",0 followers,Jimmy Thomas,8.2K,282,2.3M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
2,"At a basic level, there are 2 resource types: material and energy. For almost all elements, we can reuse atoms indefinitely without wearing them out. Recycling and re-refining is just a matter of technology and energy. So that brings us to the real limiting resource: energy. Is there enough energy? Yes. The amount of sunlight falling on the Earth divided by 7B people is quite a bit higher than the 10–11 kW of primary energy used per person in America. But sunlight is difficult to harvest.

We don’t currently have a cost effective technology to harvest and store this large quantity of solar energy. But sunlight isn’t the only energy source. (footnote: hydro and wind are secondary sunlight energy forms, waves are tertiary derived from wind.) There are four other sources: orbital energy of the moon (tides), radioactive decay heat (geothermal), heavy metal fission, and light element fusion. The first two are insignificant compared to the latter. We have the technology in hand to do heavy metal fission and even fusion could be practical usingIn the near term, we are limited by technological understanding and investment capital. There’s a difference between things we know how to do and things that still need to be invented. For example, we know how to extract Uranium from sea water and we know how much it will cost. We know how to build nuclear power plants like the IFR or the Terrapower reactor that will burn a large fraction of all Uranium. We even know how to build nuclear power plants like the MSR which will burn Thorium. We don’t yet know how to collect solar energy at high efficiency (limiting natural land requirements) and low enough cost (high enough ERoEI) to improve lifestyle while transitioning from fossil fuels. We know even less about how to do non-bomb nuclear fusion energy production. However, in the longer term timescale, technology advances. 50 or 100 years is a really long time in technology development these days. I fully expect that some of the solar energy, energy storage, and plasma fusion control technologies will become cost effective within 100 years changing everything.The interesting question isn’t what is possible, but what will the rates of development be compared to the dynamics of resource depletion and climate change. We will have resource squeezes such as fresh water shortages and we will change the climate with fossil carbon emissions. How bad these problems get depends on how quickly we develop and deploy the technologies of fission, fusion, solar collection and storage, and desalination.",1 follower,Xitong Zou,6.1K,3K,11.9M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries

The real problem of world hunger is a political one. The United States alone produces enough food to feed several large countries so certainly we have more than enough if all other countries could be made to produce that much, perhaps through technology. The reason that a billion people starve every day is because they live in countries that have governments who care nothing for those ""useless eaters"" and would horde what little resource their country have for extravagant lifestyle even as their people starve. It is unfortunately not unlike Feudalistic Europe. If they had a government with the same level of democracy as the US with a culture that supports it (as in, not being totally dependent on governments for their welfare and holding those governments accountable to their people), they could prosper with what they have and we wouldn't have a billion people starving every day. Unfortunately most countries sees the government in a very top down way rather than a power that cooperates with the people for the benefit of the country.As others have said, there are more than enough out there, all it takes is technological breakthrough to extract them, increased energy to foster extraction, and a recycling program to reuse what we do have. Fusion energy sounds good, but nuclear fission is what we can use right NOW. I still think that fusion energy will have their own set of danger and drawback, and we as a society needs to learn to reduce those risks, and not cast them aside like they are evil. Nuclear fission can produce large quantity of energy for very little input material, is carbon neutral and is a viable alternative to fossil fuel. It should be built on a geologically stable location, but other than that it doesn't really matter where you build them as long as they're away from people. In places where the sun doesn't shine as much as we like to solar is next to useless. Wind power isn't all it's cracked up to be. It kills birds, and it really can't produce anywhere near the energy required to replace fossil fuel. Germany has a LOT of wind turbines, and when they decided to go nuclear free they had to turn to fossil fuel. Japan reactivated their nuclear power because there just isn't any viable alternative and green energy produces far too little for the amount of space they require.We may not always be able to live in giant houses and drive big SUV but increased population density is actually better for developments that would reduce an individual's ecological footprint. It would also not necessitate people driving because you could build mass transit in densely populated areas. That would also reduce ecological footprint considerably, while still providing a good standard of living for all.",0 followers,Rahul Shrivastava,19K,587,53.4M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Without proper confinement of the plasma, the reactor walls would get hot and the fusion fuel would get cold and the reaction would stop. The hot, electrically charged plasma must be isolated from the walls of the reactor using magnetic fields. The most advance machine for this purpose is “tokamak"". JET is the best performing tokamak in the world. In 1997, it produced 16MW of fusion power with 24MW input i.e. 65% as much energy out as was put in. It holds the world record for total fusion power produced and for getting closest to energy breakeven. Experiments have been built and much has been learned, but progress towards energy breakeven has slowed. It has yet to be reached almost 20-years after those momentous JET experiments.Currently, ITER experiment under construction in the south of France, will be over 30m tall and weigh about 23,000 tonnes. When ITER was being designed in the 1990s it believed that only feasible way to increase power was to increase size. However, the size and complexity of ITER has led to very slow progress, with first plasma now set for 2025 and the first use of tritium fuel not expected until well into the 2030s. The possibility of a smaller waybto fusion has fired the imagination of inventors, innovators and now investors. Ventures like Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, and now the Breakthrough Energy Coalition led by Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, have large investments examples in new technologies. In the late 2000s, research from the European Commision found there was virtually no private investment in fusion technology. Nearly all money in fusion came through one single programme called EURATOM.In the past few years, fusion has gained the attention of high-profile technology backers such as Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, paul Allen of Microsoft and Peter Thiel, co-founder of payPal, together they have invested many tens of millions into private fusion ventures in the US. Tokamak Energy has enabled complex fusion engineering to be developed faster than it has for years and has a leading role in the race of fusion energy.Research into fusion began in the mid-20th century. In 2015 and 2016 papers were established that showed, for the first time, size is not important factor in fusion reactors. One of these papers 'On the Power and Size of tokamak Fusion Pilot Plants and Reactors’ has gone to have the most online downloads in the history of Nuclear Fusion journal. Tokamak Energy has developed 'high temperature’ superconducting (HTS) magnets using HTS tape that has remarkably high conductivity even in exceptionally high magnetic fields. The magnets can fit through the centre of a smaller reactor. Thus using private investment, Tokamak Energy has successfully overcome a key engineering problem of reducing reactor size while maintaining performance.Tokamak Energy aims to deliver a fusion power gain by 2020, first electricity by 2025 and a 100MW power plant by 2030. It's third device, a high-field spherical tokamak, is already nearing completion. The company plans to build five tokamaks-the fifth being a prototype commercial reactor that can be plugged into the grid to prove the concept of compact, modular fusion power stations.General Fusion in Canada is using a magnetised vortex approach based on scientific theory from 30-years ago. Currently this involves developing sub-systems that will be used to operate the reactor ahead of a prototype reactor build. Tri-Alpha Energy in California is addressing the challenge of heating up a plasma within its novel hydrogen-boron reactor, over next 3–4 years to validate its technology.Developer NuScale Power's explanation is typical: it says it offers a “shorter, more predictable” construction period, which reduces financial risks and costs, while the size of its prototype reactor ensures a far less complex and product. With a smaller, more cost effective and flexible nuclear energy intrastructure on the horizon, both fusion and fission are following an established trend across the energy industry for more distributed generation.As a scientific concept, it has grabbed the imagination since it was first identified as the source of energy in the sun. The new climate of investment and appetite for fresh approaches brings hope for a fusion future.The old jest is that fusion will forever be 30-years away. Tokamak Energy is working squarely on making it a reality much sooner. .","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries

So far the only devices humans have built that produce fusion energy in large quantities are nuclear weapons so lets count those out.The proposed fusion reactors plants that would be used to produce heat for electricity generations and other useful purposes are all pretty large in physical dimensions. In fact in terms of the reactor unit itself the common fission powered PWR electricity plants common world wide are very small compared to the massive magnetic confinement machinery needed for a plasma toroid design like the TOKAMAK being tested now.

In fact in terms of the reactor unit itself the common fission powered PWR electricity plants common world wide are very small compared to the massive magnetic confinement machinery needed for a plasma toroid design like the TOKAMAK being tested now. That is why you can fit a small fission reactor in a vessel like a submarine.This is a diagram of the ITER prototype which has so far only managed to very briefly generate 0.33% of the energy it consumes to operate. It is highly probable that to come any closer to generating more energy than it consumes to power itself the final unit will have to be several times larger just to break even and supply its own power demands.That final design is still just paper studies and speculation and this is a device humans have been working to build since the 1950’s when the first fusion bombs proved humans could make fusion happen outside of stars.I could be simplistic and say something silly like if this design produces 0.33% of the input energy the final design will have to be at least 3 times as large but in the real world physics doesn’t work like that. If it did work like that an SUV would be twice as fuel efficient as a compact car and we all know that isn’t true.If it turns out we can make a fusion reactor that produces more energy than it consumes and if that reactor is small enough we can afford the construction cost and if we can figure out how to deal with the extreme neutron radiation it produces while operating and if we can convince people it is worth all the effort when we already have green energy sources like hydroelectricity, geothermal, fission, wind ans solar then maybe fusion can be a silver bullet for all our energy problems.That is a lot of if-then statements, when any of those fails to be true the whole chain of logic breaks down.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
14,"Pretty much. Wind and solar are all ultimately powered by that big nuclear fusion reactor that rises in the East every morning. The sun also ultimately powers hydro-electricity.When we humans have electrified almost everything and get almost all our electricity from renewables, solar fusion will be the ultimate source.Terrestrial fusion is the longest of the very-long-odds wagers for people who cannot think of any better thing to do with their money. Tiny chance of success but potentially huge payout if it works.Terrestrial fusion is never going to be the one answer to *all* our energy needs aPretty much.

Tiny chance of success but potentially huge payout if it works.Terrestrial fusion is never going to be the one answer to *all* our energy needs any more than nuclear fission was the one answer (although I bet the militaries of the world will love fusion, along with spare exploration companies).I really think that we humans will eventually succeed in making terrestrial fusion work in the sense of producing a useful output, although probably not in what is left of my lifetime. But I’m far less confident that it can be done cheaply enough to be a commercial success.Q: Is fusion energy considered a silver bullet for all our energy needs?","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
15,Doubtful. If we relied on ‘silver bullets’ to save us we’d be long dead.Every decade scientists announce a great fusion breakthrough that should be our power salvation within the next 50 years.I often imagine scientists have stayed locked up in a lab. for so long they’ve forgotten what happens in the real world where things need to work for real not just for a pico second in some huge underground tunnel full of electromagnets and quark sandwiches.,2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
16,That is one of the issues that has yet to be demonstrated practically in the development of fusion power. In theory the energy output in the form of high energy neutrons will be captured to be converted to heat and thence power.This is why generating a self sustaining reaction is not the end of the development process. Going from there to a functioning commercial reactor requires other problems like this to be solved and demonstrated.,"3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
17,"The energy does not come out directly in thermal form. It comes mainly from very energetic neutrons which leave the actual fusion reaction. Those neutrons are then captured by a blanket of material which slows them down and captures their kinetic energy, turning it into heat.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
18,"In a tokamak reactor the vacuum vessel will likely have blanket modules around the plasma. These will absorb the energy from the neutrons (which carry off 80% of the energy from DT fusion), and the lithium that they are likely to contain will breed more tritium to use as ‘fuel’.ITER will test six or more designs for the blanket modules. Finding materials that can survive years of the neutron flux is one of the problems.The molten lithium or a lithium salt can be pumped through heat exchangers to heat water perhaps directly to steam which can drive turbine-generators as in all nuclear fission pIn a tokamak reactor the vacuum vessel will likely have blanket modules around the plasma.

19,The fusion process will generate a great deal of heat. A cooling system will be provided to keep the containment vessel cool. The heat will be transferred from the cooling medium to a water supply to raise steam. The superheated steam will then be passed through several staged of a steam turbine to drive a generator which will then supply electrical power to the grid.,0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777.2K,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
