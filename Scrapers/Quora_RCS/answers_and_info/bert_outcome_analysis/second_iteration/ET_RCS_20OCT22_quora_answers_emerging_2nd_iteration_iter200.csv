Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantity or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel-No greenhouse gasses produced-No reactor core meltdowns and no fission product decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)-No mining of fuel is required for several forms of fusion as deuterium fuel is extracted directly from water. For first generation deuterium-tritium fusion; lithium must be mined and then exposed to a source of neutrons to form tritium fuel. Second generation fusion fuels like pure deuterium is totally nonradioactive and can be obtained from sea water without resorting to surface mining.-Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus a few thousand years for uranium based fission and a few hundreds of years for fossil fuels)-1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power (typical nuclear power). Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.-Radioactive waste remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands. DT fusion reactors would burn and require storage of significant quantities of tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not highly hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.-Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)-No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy

They are trying mightily to get one going by itself without massive power from the outside to keep it going. No luck so far.However, there is this: Fission reactors have a LOT of fuel (Uranium, usually) in them. Tons of it! And lots of radioactive decay products of nuclear fission. If something goes disastrously wrong (Chernobyl) there’s an awful lot of radioactive material to spread around.Fusion reactors will presumably have very little fuel at one time, as it gets fed in and burned up continually. Grams, maybe. Pounds - no way! And the “fuel” is relatively harmless. Deuterium, Lithium, stuff like that. The Fusion reactor itself, on the other hand will be quite radioactive: The many tons of whatever its built from will have been intensely irradiated by the fusion going on, producing radioactive material, but I doubt that it can match the wide variety of nasty stuff from a fission reactor. So: I think a fission reactor would have far more potential for radioactive contamination than a fusion reactor, once we have one. But explosive danger? No.[ Thought added in edit: I do see one problem peculiar to the type of fusion reactors we’re working on now: the huge magnetic field they require. These magnetic field are critical to the fusion reactor operation, and the stronger the field, the smaller the reactor can be. These fields store a LOT of energy, and depend upon superconductors to keep the huge currents flowing. If part of the electric circuit drops out of superconductivity, the energy gets dumped into that failed part, and will create a huge electric arc, likely destroying the field coils, possibly destroying the whole system. Something similar happened in the early days of the supercollider in Switzerland/France. No hydrogen explosion, probably nothing to scatter things far and wide, so little danger to surrounding community, and they have ways to prevent this happening, they think.

6,"A fusion reaction, any exergonic fusion reaction releases a great deal of energy. The release of energy inevitably heats the material in which the reactions occur, and under ordinary circumstances this causes the material to expand.

The release of energy inevitably heats the material in which the reactions occur, and under ordinary circumstances this causes the material to expand. Fusion reaction rates are rapidly increasing with temperature at temperatures below the Coulomb barrier, but they also are rapidly decreasing with density.So the conditions for a runaway fusion reaction to occur are fairly delicately balanced by these factors.To produce a runaway reaction the fusion fuel must be at high enough density, it must be at high enough temperature, and it must be kept in place for long enough.In nature such a thing only happens when gravitational forces become large enough that the density of matter is so high that electron degeneracy pressure supports the matter, as happens in white dwarf stars. This is a fantastically high density, not easy to conceive of even.In such a case the reaction rate can indeed grow more quickly than the highly condensed and gravitationally bound matter can escape. This results in the helium flash in dwarf stars like the Sun, and it also is believed with quite good evidence to result in type Ia supernovae by another mechanism than the helium flash. The helium flash does not destroy a star like the Sun, but it does lift the whole core out of electron degeneracy against its own gravity. In a white dwarf that undergoes a type Ia supernova the star is completely disrupted. The energy release is very large in such a runaway reaction.But such conditions are not possible to replicate on Earth, and thankfully so.Instead all designs for fusion reactors operate in regimes of far smaller density than exists in the core of the Sun even, where a runaway reaction is prevented because of the hydrodynamic factors that I mentioned above. Generally they operate at far higher temperatures and lower densities than exist in the core of the Sun, whatever the means is that is employed to confine the fusing plasma fuel, and the extreme heat leads to instabilities that attempt very, very hard to reduce the density of the plasma, and so turn the fusion reaction off long before it has time to run away in the sense you may mean. This is true of all of the magnetic confinement designs. That is in fact the major difficulty, keeping the hot and fairly dilute plasma from simply expanding and hitting the walls of the reactor vessel.The exception, and the only known viable artificial exception to this on Earth is inertial confinement of a very high temperature plasma, maybe ten times the temperature at the core of the Sun -this plasma is created by using a large part of the energy of a small fission weapon to produce an extremely efficient compression and heating (there is more to it than this of course) of some macroscopic amount of fusion fuel, typically lithium deuteride is used. This of course is a thermonuclear weapon, and it is dependent on a runaway fusion reaction. The fusion still ends once the fuel has expanded enough and been exhausted, but the densities and temperatures reached are high enough and last long enough that there is a spectacular release of energy from the bomb fuel.Now there are versions of inertial confinement fusion reactor design, which use the same basic principle as a bomb to try to initiate a fusion reaction, but these limit the energy release by using very tiny pellets of fuel. So while the reaction would runaway, ideally, it would cut off due to the drop in density and exhaustion of fuel before a big enough energy release would occur to be dangerous.it’s similar to the use of controlled explosions in the pistons in internal combustion engines. You don’t set out to build a huge fuel air explosive based on gasoline, you set out to build a motor instead, so that is what you get. You don’t get a bomb.In practice inertial confinement fusion reactors have proved hard to actually make work, aside from fusion bombs, which you could I suppose loosely call fusion reactors.The other appraches to building fusion reactors are either working in regimes of density and temperature in which the fusion reaction will always be self-limiting, or else they are using very small amounts of fusion fuel and are pulsed.Such designs inherently avoid the possibility of a runaway reaction. It’s not quite the same way as thermal spectrum nuclear reactors do this, but it is analogous. The conditions needed for a working power reactor are very diffferent than those needed for a bomb.Now, if the approach is magnetic confinement, then in the very largest machines designed, the energy stored in the confining magnetic fields is huge, and it certainly could produce quite an explosion in principle, but it would be like a conventional explosion at worst, even if there were no mitigation at all designed into the reactor building.If the confining magnets were to explode, the confining field would be lost, and the fusion reactions in the plasma would quickly end. So there would never be a thermonuclear explosion.Now in the early days, people, namely Edward Teller, did worry that a nuclear or thermonuclear explosion might ignite the Earth’a atmosphere or the oceans in a runaway fusion reaction. So, before the Trinity test I believe, Hans Bethe actually did a calculation that showed, correctly, as it turned out, after many bomb tests in the atmosphere and oceans, that while the energy of the weapon can and does certainly produce some nuclear reactions in the atmosphere or oceans, which do release some energy, still, the power released by these reactions is much smaller than the power disssipated otherwise in the atmosphere or oceans, so that a self-sustaining reaction in the atmosphere simply cannot be started this way. It is not at all like setting fire to dry kindling.No possibility of such a fusion reaction initiated by a thermonuclear weapon exists.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy
7,"Significant rates of fusion are only maintained by a system which energizes and confines the fuel.
