1,"Few of the major ""realizations"" after my four years at IIT-Delhi:1. 90% of the professors are bad teachers, and I mean really bad. They are intelligent, dedicated, and hard working, but they just don't have the teaching skills which can inculcate curiosity and trigger students interest in the subject. I am not saying that all professors are bad, there are some really good ones but I can count them on my fingers. Most professors come to the lecture room with some slides, and start ""pouring down"" stuff expecting students to catch everything via this one-way interaction.2.

They are intelligent, dedicated, and hard working, but they just don't have the teaching skills which can inculcate curiosity and trigger students interest in the subject. I am not saying that all professors are bad, there are some really good ones but I can count them on my fingers. Most professors come to the lecture room with some slides, and start ""pouring down"" stuff expecting students to catch everything via this one-way interaction.2. IITs are famous not because of their research or teaching standards, but because they get the crème de la crème of students via rigorous entrance tests. I honestly think that these relatively high IQ students can get the same grades in IIT without attending classes if they learn on their own. The quality of teaching doesn't matter when you have such high IQ students who can anyway grasp concepts easily. Unfortunately I was not gifted with such a high IQ (I could only crack IIT in my second attempt), but I noticed how sharp my fellow students are and how easily they could understand things with even sub-standard teaching.So what happens when you have such brilliant students but no one to guide them into the vast and challenging fields of engineering? See my next point.3. Because of #1 and #2 above, most students do not develop genuine interest in engineering subjects despite having brilliant minds. They think getting an IIT degree is just a stepping stone and are lured by either the ""glamour and riches"" of MBA from IIMs, or the ""respect-and status"" of Civil Services. Those left want to emigrate to US or other developed countries by pursuing either MBA or M.Tech. from abroad. No one is interested to pursue hard core engineering because IITs simply failed to inculcate such interests.4. Socialist-era mindset: This is one issue which bugged me a lot during my life in IIT. After my first semester, I had to fill in the form for next semester fees and deposit it in the accounts section. But the ""uncle"" sitting at the counter kept delaying my deposit for weird reasons like:(a) ""Your form is not complete, put in your name in capitals and come back tomorrow."" I asked him why can't he take the corrected form today, he threw some weird rule to me.I was frustrated and went to the student-affairs dean to lodge a complaint against him, but the dean shocked me with his nonchalant words: ""Dear Vivek, here at IIT we also want to train you to deal with the outside world. This bureaucracy is something you should get accustomed to, so deal with it and do not come complaining for such small issues"".I was very disappointed seeing such attitude, and expected IITs at least to have modern (rather efficient) outlook towards such issues, and most of these professors/deans did their PhD from abroad. It pained me to see how they are making students accustomed to Indian bureaucracy instead of imbibing best practices from abroad.5. Even today, after more than 11 years of graduating from IIT Delhi, life has not changed there. As a part of our social initiative, we wanted to donate an intranet where students and professors can collaborate easily and make learning more interesting. But the professors at the IIT Delhi CS department downplayed us citing reasons like ""we cannot install your software on our servers because what if it gets hacked"", ""students don't need such advanced software, we are happy with Moodle"". When we asked them to let us know how many professors and students were using Moodle, he tried to change the subject.Anyways, my point being that unless premier colleges like IIT change their attitude, India will not and cannot succeed. We will only be followers and not creators.",555 followers,Vivek Thakur,6.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bitter-truths-about-life-at-IIT-BITS-Pilani

Frankly I am doing this in public interest; having been present in recruiting rooms where resumes were seen, laughed at, and junked off, because they had more of these bullet point positions on the resume, than the GPA they carried.

There are no channels through which you will ever get justice.Guides are more efficient in making an environment of favouritism and finding ways to make money through government grants.If you want to do something in research then my advice would beI wrote these things based on my experience.EDIT:1. Case 1: This boy is from very humble background. His parents are farmers. For last 3 years this person is doing everything for the guide which includes depositing money in post office to picking up dirty plates at his home after parties. With lots of hard work he got results and wrote a paper. When he showed it to his guide after reading 4 or 5 lines he scolded him as there were some mistakes in language. He is running after his guide for last 5 months to approve his paper till now his guide has not even tried to read his paper. This boy is not convent educated, you are a2. Case 2: This guide fell in love with her student and married him. Now his husband is running the lab. Every work from students has his name on it. From international conference to domestic, he gets the first preference on the expense of others.3. Case 3: Guide asked this girl to help a fellow scholar, who is apparently useless except carrying Guide's bag and filling his wife's water bottle, who was working on MHRD sanctioned project. The guide promised that results will be shown on her progress as well. After 2 years of hard work the guide secretly told that scholar to show all results in his progress seminar. When she requested him for different work he scolded her and after  3 or 4 months of request gave her different work, she is still suffering under the guide and he is hell bent to take revenge.4. Case 4: many a times fake interviews are called to select research scholars. Candidates are already decided, these interviews are just to show the system that they are following due process.5. Case 5: In one case the student can't talk to the guide as he is very rude. He won't bring any chemicals or let others order. One day he will give an instruction next day he will just deny that he has ever said it and will scold the scholar. Scholar can't even argue or complain or even drop mail to him as reminder as  Guide does not want anything in written.6. Case 6: This girl has spent 6 years doing her PhD. Completed all the works, published papers but the guide is not ready to let her complete her degree. She is married now and even her husband has requested the guide to let her submit her thesis.You can't change the guide, well you can but this process is too long and again all depends on luck i.e if anyone is willing to go against fellow colleague and take you under him/her.I can go on and on. Now question is why is this happening? Basic difference between Professors in India and abroad is this. In India they are in government job and nobody can remove them, they are answerable to no one, if the research is not going well they always know how to trick the system, as far as work of research scholars go if results are not coming its student's fault and again he is not answerable to no one for the student's performance . In abroad Professors work on tenure which is based on their work. Moreover if their students are not doing well, its Guide's fault as if the student has reached so far he must have some caliber so Guide needs to answer for bad work. Research has no importance in India.There are few good people but the question is,will you be so lucky because I certainly know that you will not get help from the system.","1,279 followers",Arjunlal B,659,354,1.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bitter-truths-about-life-at-IIT-BITS-Pilani

So, the truth is that most of the students are at IIT ,2. The way of teaching at IIT is nowhere as expected by us in our school days. In the first year , you study most of the things you have already studied in your school days like physics , chemistry , maths , c programming , environmental science , english or professional communication and attend physics , chemistry labs which have nothing to do with your branch. The work load is high in the first year as you have to submit various assignments , maintain lab files and you hardly get any time to study something related to real life problem or something innovative. In the next two years , you are taught all the subjects related to your branch , the study pressure is high , you have to attend classes from 8 to 5 and the students are mostly involved with what is taught in the class. So , for first three years  there is no scope of innovation considering the ruthless and time consuming schedule. In the fourth year , the students have to choose their final year project ,3. Teacher are bad , non co-operative , lack teaching skills and focus more on attendance , surprise quizzes , assignments rather than giving some challenging projects . Students are evaluated on the basis of their rattafication skills. Project work or innovative works carry very less weightage as compared to theory. So ,4. After joining IIT , everyone including our parents expect something like 8 digit salary package as is hyped by the media. But the truth is that it is true only for software branches like cse , mathematics and computing , information technology. Rest of the branches hardly see even more than 70% placements with an average salary of 6 to 7 lakhs.

Just One of those Multi Function Displays (MFDs or those “TV screens”) cost $69,000. Small hardware updates are done as components get turned in for rapair. “Major” updates have only occurred twice with the second one in process right now for the next 3 years, when the biggest hardware update is due out.Consider we have some of the best state of the art equipment in the US Military. Compared to civilian Off The Shelf hardware, Military gear is usually 3 years out of date. That is simply because civilian gear is built to lower specification then military gear. Currently, there are no touch screens in existence that can handle the extreme temperatures asked of military helicopters. I understand there are arguments from other services or the airlines on this. I will simply note, their equipment is in air conditioned aircraft. Ours is not. When you are in 127° in Iraq while cooking in direct sunlight , so is the aircraft and all of its parts. So upgrades are not so easy to come by.

We actually get the cutting edge technology. In general military processors are over a decade older. Defense forces place higher emphasis on mature technology that is reliable and don’t go for latest and greatest.There are exceptions however. Super computers and custom chips have no equal in the civilian space. Some of the chips which are used in signal processing and military Radio’s are never going to be seen by you and me in any store.Super computers that the defense forces use are also much more powerful than anything we use mainly because they use custom components optimized for their need built on reliable 10 year old process. Civilian super computers are rather generic. We use GPU’s for number crunching (bit coins, gene splicing, scientific computing and modelling, etc) and general processors for everything else. A data center is unlikely to feature in the top 50 super computers simply because its not built and optimized for number crunching. Its designed and built for large data transactions and as such usually are scalable easily and host large storage space instead of best computing power. Most companies have data centers and not compute clusters. However, biotech and advanced research companies are a different lot. They have compute super computers and still have plenty of data storage. These systems are optimized for computations and they can afford to go with the latest and greatest.So in general civilian technology is usually cutting edge, but also more unstable. Defense systems cannot afford to get the latest 8th gen core -ix and have blue screens. They would rather get a custom high end 4th gen core i7 which are much more reliable and supported very well with all their bugs known and addressed.Military systems and corporate systems are usually completely replaced every 10 years. They are rarely upgraded. It takes 1 year to evaluate and design the specs. then there is a year of tendering process. Finally a company is chosen to build it with what is 2 year old mature technology at that point. It takes another 3 years to build the system, test it, fix plenty of issues and transfer control.

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally.

The U.S. practices your old-fashioned socialism in R&D, which is acceptable to the political establishment because they’ve always been Okay with ‘socialize the cost, privatize the profit’. In the 60’s, when the computer, the internet, NASA, etc., were first invented, the US government paid for almost 2/3 of all the R&D in the U.S.Source:Nobody else was going to pay for basic science. But once you have the basic science figured out, people can start developing application science based on the basic science and make money. That’s when industry started pouring money into it. Private money expects a return on investment, you know.The thing is, basic science requires a lot of super expensive capital equipment. The first computers, the linear accelerators, the space technology, etc., were astronomically expensive, for example. Everything is build from self-designed/hand-made/precision/custom parts, so what can you do? So you can’t look at R&D spending on a per-capita basis, because either you have the $billion dollar budget to build the equipment, or you don’t. The scientists themselves weren’t paid that much. It was all experimental equipment. And the US Government opened its wallet for that sort of things in the 60’s and 70’s. Canada simply didn’t have that kind of money.And it’s very likely that you spend all that money, build all that stuff, and it doesn’t work! And even if it does work, what do you get out of it? Well you get to publish some papers on Science or Nature. That’s it. It’s really, really, significant to the scientists, but the other people couldn’t care less. That’s the way it is with basic science. Historically, only rich countries can do basic science.
