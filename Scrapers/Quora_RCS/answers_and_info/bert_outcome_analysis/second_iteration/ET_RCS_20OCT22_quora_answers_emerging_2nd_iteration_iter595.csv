But I'm going to have to give my vote to Dr Victor Von DoomDr Doom is a lot of things. Megalomaniacal, egotistical, calculating, a tyrant, a despot, a dictator and a lot more. But more than all of this, he's also basically a prophesied savior for humanity.Wait. What?Oh yeah stick around guys and gals.Dr Doom once travelled to Wakanda in spirit form (he actually planned to invade Wakanda but didn't need to) where he met with Bast, the Panther Goddess and chief god of Wakanda. Bast is most known for giving her blessing(s) to the current king and champion of Wakanda, the Black Panther (whoever it may be at the time) and giving this person the capabilities that is often associated with being the Black Panther. Upon meeting with Bast, she informed him that she would devour his soul if he lied to her for his trespassing into her domain.But what was his reason? Doom wanted the Vibranium to aid in his conquest of Earth. Apparently Vibranium has a special property when magic is applied by amplifying it. In this regard, the potential of Vibranium could well be infinite. And being that Doom is a very capable sorcerer, this could only serve him very well.Doom was measured by Bast as she questioned his reasons and his resolve. She was unimpressed with him initially, believing him to be hardly more than another evil and greedy man going so far as to call him a monster for his many crimes. But unsurprisingly, and in a very Doom fashion, Victor spoke honestly with her and didn't make any attempts to sugarcoat his actions or his reasons, going so far as to measure himself against the actions of the whole of humanity and even against the actions taken by the nation and kingdom of Wakanda, gods and even destiny itself.This momentarily angers Bast, as Doom invites her to look into his soul and get a true measure of his character and his actions. Bast does precisely this as she peers into his soul and here she sees and learns of his anguish, his pains and his faith in himself and of his beliefs.Inside his soul with his memories laid bare, Bast sees things as Doom does and it is hectic, violent, and in desperate need of order. As he details all of this to Bast, we can see that both she and Doom are looking on at various events unfolding. Through these visions, we begin to see why Doom schemes and plots these machinations.Presumably while using his magicks, Doom has peered across the history of humanity (past, present and future). Sadly in all of these events, humanity never gets any better except for one possible future. It’s here that we learn of Doom's goal and the one conclusion that he's drawn.Only he can save humanity if humanity was united under him.Doom admits that his actions are less than savory. But he goes further with his explaining and informs Bast that his methods are what's necessary to see his goal accomplished. He believes that people are opposed to him are simply afraid of this because he views himself as an agent of change. He even goes so far as to explain why he dislikes Rees Richards and T'Challa so much. Because they don't want to change. If he represents change (the Doom of what currently is) than this would make Reed and T'Challa his natural enemies as they would want what's better for here and now. Making them agents of conservation. But he wants more and better for a better and brighter tomorrow.Once again, he asks Bast to take measure of him. But this time, he challenges her to do so while measuring him against the crimes and heinous acts of humanity.At the end of this incredibly insightful journey, Bast makes a revelation that is just as surprising as Doom's true goal and intentions.She has also looked into just as many futures as Doom has and more surprisingly…she actually agrees with him.She believes that Doom is all that he believes and claims himself to be. Doom is the leader to make the hard choices and take the hard path to ensure that humanity reaches its full potential. He is the best possible leader for the betterment of mankind.If Dr Doom ever actually won, it would actually be the best thing for humanity. But thanks to his methods and his ruthlessness to see this (for all intents and purposes) divine goal come to fruition, he's regarded as a villain.And there you go.All hail Dr Doom. Our savior.",12 followers,Steven Carter,993,3K,12.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero

I will pick something a bit unorthodox here:Vandal Savage as portrayed in Young Justice animated series. You see, Savage starts off being seen as a bonafide villain. He leads the Light,basically a Society of super-villains,a group that gathers mostly behind computer screens and seemingly plot world domination.See? Most of the members believe that humanity is being done disservice in the long run by heroics of the Justice League. Essentially humanity’s evolution and ability to overcome difficulties is being hindered by superheroes who constantly intervene and prevent human progress. Savage is the creator of this idea:In ancient Babylon he stood tall against the invaders from outer space,protecting humanity:Savage defeated them at the cost of his son Nabu(yes,in this universe Doctor Fate). In centuries to come Savage kept influencing and shaping history until he met an unlikely ally:Darkseid invaded Earth. He was impressed by Savage’s resilience and thus Savage managed to negotiate peace. A partnership of sorts,where each other would wage conquest until time came for the final battle between them. Ultimate cosmic survival of the fittest. Possibly an also inevitable outcome. Savage most likely schemes against Darkseid,preparing humanity for that final enemy that threatens all. Savage is one of the more complex characters. I can’t imagine the loneliness,the pain endured for 50 000 yrs watching children die….until you grow numb enough that you put them out of their misery themselves:Savage is definetly an antagonist. He hinders the protagonists,he shows little mercy and most of his actions are in essence ,,evil”. But are they necessary evil? We have no idea what his ultimate plans are. We have no idea how he wills to eventually outsmart Darkseid. We have no idea how powerful Darkseid is in this universe. So basically Savage is playing the long game. Game for the greater good and eventual rise of humanity. His daughter Cassandra considered him humanity’s greatest hero. There is some nobility in him. There is also solitude,pain……I just know I don’t feel that much of “I’m totally evil” vibe from him :D","220,160 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,779.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero

Setting aside the fact that the guy rebuilds Gotham and saves the world that time when Superman is busy in another dimension, he’s portrayed as a villain because he keeps trying to kill Superman. And Superman is perfect, right? So he must be a bad guy if he hates Superman. I take issue with that.

What about our right to self determination? What about problems of international relations? Does Superman care about any of that or does he think that might makes right? Or that because he thinks he is doing good things, that makes it okay?Lex is worried that Superman is basically unstoppable. Superman clearly feels he has the right to make all the decisions for himself. If he decided that the best way to protect people was to make himself Dictator of Earth exactly what could we do to stop him? And another thing, he is an American citizen, right? So when he shows up in other countries, again, uninvited, without permission, and destroys their property, is that an act of terrorism committed by an American citizen on foreign soil? Or is his tacit approval by the American government make him an agent of said government and therefore it is, in fact, an act of war by America against a foreign country? Did we authorize him to take those actions? Does Congress approve of his reckless behavior? No! He just decided, himself, that he was allowed to do those things.Sure, he does good things, but there’s a road he’s paving by doing that and it doesn’t lead to a good place. And he gets to decide what is and is not good. He decides who is and is not good. Then he acts on that, without anyone else’s input. Sometimes, those are other Kryptonians but sometimes he’s an alien attacking humans. Lex Luthor has a completely legitimate point about there being huge problems with the way Superman behaves and humans’ casual acceptance of that behavior is a failure on our part to properly think about what he is doing. Lex isn’t exactly going about it in the best way, but I think casting him as nothing more than a villain who gamed the system fails to take into account that Superman is not really the hero people want him to be. When you really think about it, it’s almost an accident that Superman is a good guy. Like in the alternate dimension where he is Ultraman. Just because he accidentally ended up having a happy child and being raised by good parents doesn’t make what he’s doing okay and Lex Luthor is the one who is pointing that out. More modern comics and movies have started to take that into account. You know why? Because Lex was right all along.",UNKNOWN,Isaac,2.1K,1.4K,26.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero

We were always on the look out for new maps but the real problem was sharing the map files or the links.The in-game downloader of maps was super slow and took ages to download even even small maps of mere 10–12 MB.Sharing the download link became a pain because the site we used to download the maps, for some reason always had broken links or maybe it was our fault.Fortunately,Have a look at the following code. It’s a bash/code file I made a long time ago - luckily I still have it and will preserve it always as a memory :)As it suggests, upon executing this file it’ll download all the files as specified in the code.To make it work for yourself;echoAdd the download link of the file(s) you want like thisOne wget command can only download one file at a time so you’ll have to pack the contents into a rar/zip file first else use multiple wget statements to download files in a series.Here’s what it looks like in actionSave the above code withCombine the above two and make the best out of them :)Trick 3This one is long and I already have a separate answer for this one.Anirudh Rath's answer to How do you pass the password for Windows?This trick is independent of version of Windows i.e. works with WIndows 7, 8 & 10.This above trick will help you take control of your college computers which is a must!Trick 4Control who connects to your Wi-Fi network without using any third party software.Most of use have Wi-FI network at our homes and at some point of time we’re either concerned about the data usage or just paranoid that someone is using our Wi-Fi.Worst case scenario? We don’t want to share our Wi-Fi network with someone.So how do you produce a solution to this problem?The answer is yourRouter Gateway is the self hosted back-end that allows you to meddle with your router settings. These include basics such as the WI-Fi password to advanced settings such as Port Forwarding and DNS settings.I don’t know how to open up my Router Gateway :/On your router you’ll find a sticker which has all the details you need; on it you’ll find an IP address followed by a username and password.There you go!Only the devices whose MAC address you’ve added in the allowed list will be able to use the internet. You can connect to the Wi-FI network but unless the MAC address isn’t added, the device won’t be able to send or receive any packet.Trick 5Disabling Windows 10 automatic updateWe all know. It’s irritating as hell.Here’s how you disable it.I cannot attach screenshots for this because I don’t use Windows. Sorry.You’re good to go!Side NotesI’ll continue to add more over time according to convenience with my schedule.Leave a comment if you know a trick or two, feel confused about what I’ve posted or have any suggestion.A couple of people asked me what environment I’m on or what OS am I using.

Basically, a subset of the 1MB cartridge data must be loaded into the 2kb RAM and used to render the 180kb screen. How does one achieve that?SpriteSheetsSprite sheets contain small tiles of graphics, that are re-used over and over again. For example, below is a remake of the original super mario sprite sheet:It’s not the exact original sprite sheet, but you can get a sense of the small blocks of data that can be use over-and-over again.Each small 16x16 pixel square represents a “tile” and artists would string these together to create the actual levels. The levels themselves, just became a giant 2D array of indexes into the sprite sheet. (I talk about this in a lot more detail in Lesson 3 of myBehold, that level that you parents could never complete.So with concepts like tile-sheets and sprite-sheets, we can use a small set of images to create large scenes & worlds. This is generally how most games work. Even 3D games will have a set of common textures that are applied multiple times and places throughout the game itself.Now let’s talk about generic image compression.How Images are compressedHere’s the “For example,A block-view of how JPG image compression works.So, the only place where two blocks might get compacted into 1 block, is if their post-DCTd version is identical, and RLE can make stride recommendations. This doesn’t happen that often.Despite its other flawsThe below image is a 5.9kb PNG file, while the JPG image is 106kbSince this image has lots of duplicate pixels (the blue sky background) compressors like PNG do a better job than their block-based JPG counterparts.Apples vs. DragonfruitMy point here is that it’s kinda unfair to compare game content to a single image on the internet.From the game side, you start with a small set of re-usable tiles, and index them to build up your larger image, we can do this, because we know how the game is going to be made. On the other side, JPG/PNG/WebP just tries to compress the data it can find in local blocks, without any real desire to match repeated content. Image compression is clearly at a disadvantage here, since they don’t have prior knowledge of their data space, they can’t really make any expectations about it.I mean, considerA much better comparison. The .It just goes to show, with the right amount of foreknowledge about your data, you can do great things with compression.Source :Hope this information is enough to understand the black magic behind Mario.",549 followers,Kef Schecter,2.8K,3K,3M,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero

We are having this discussion in context of images and objects. This can also be extended to other aspects of any program.A game is not made by scripting the entire worlds and destinations etcetera in ONE image file. First, the smallest units of its gameplay/graphics are designed. For example, in Super Mario Bros. 2(of which the image you gave is a screenshot), the designers didn't have to create large image files, just to design the first level. They started with designing the smallest bits likeThen they just coded that which image should be placed when and where on the screen. They obviously had to code something like-""Display an image of a cloud after every 50 pixels that the player moves""Or,""Take one image of ONE Cement paver and repeatedly display it endlessly along the ground""The advantage of this method is that the piece of code used to make such repeating images, etc. occupies much lesser space than entire meters of lengths of image of cement pavers. This saves space and also the runtime space that the software needs(a.k.a. RAM).So the image you are showing consists of nothing but the same elementary images repeated a number of times (like the bricks and bushes), thus making the space required on disk small enough. But when you take this image to MS paint and save it and check its file size, <<no doubt>> the size should have increased tremendously because what MS paint is doing is that it is just encoding the entire image pixel by pixel and it doesn't know and doesn't care that such a space-saving pattern of these images has been used. Thus, explaining the larger size of the image.",187 followers,Yash Gupta,531,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero
