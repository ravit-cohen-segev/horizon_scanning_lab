U238 is a fertile material that can be made into fissionable Pu239 by causing it to absorb a neutron in a U235 reactor. Th232 is a fertile material than can be made into fissionable U233 again through neutron absorption in a breeder type reactor. Thorium is more abundant than Uranium, and therefore more easily obtained. Nobelist Carlos Rubbia proposed a subcritical energy amplifier that consisted of a Thorium Core reactor that used a particle accelerator as a neutron source to create a safe reliable reactor.Hydrogen bombs use a compounding of Lithium-6 isotope, about 7.5% of natural Lithium, and Deuterium istope about 0.03% of natural hydrogen. Put these together and bombard them with neutrons and you get 270.15 Trillion Joules per kg of the stuff, which is far more than 82 TJ/kg of other materials. The other thing about this is you don’t have long lived actinide series products.Lithium-6 with a neutron source like Polonium or Pu238 source of alpha particles illuminating Beryllium foil, or a particle accelerator that makes neutrons on demand, yield 77.2 TJ/kg on demand in a subcritical reactor. This is relatively clean process producing helium and tritium. The tritium yields 1.061 kW/kg of radioisotpe output over a 12.32 year half life. The tritium emits an electron and turns into Helium-3 which is another fusion source.Since there is not a large amount of fusion fuel inside current fusion reactor designs, there is no way for fusion reactors to melt down. In fact, in a properly designed fission reactors, there is no way for them to melt down either.For example, in the ROVER and NERVA nuclear rocket reactor, the engine contained a subcritical amount of fissile material that was covered with a neutron reflecting blanket. That blanket was built like louvers in a window that varied the number of neutrons that could be reflected. When the louvers are closed the neutron flux was very high. When louvers are open, neutron flux is below break even. In a run away event, the louvers automatically open, stopping the reaction. Should that break down, the journal bearing holding the louvers in place melt first causing them to fall off, leaving the subcritical mass naked, and it quickly cools down.Subcritical Energy Amplifiers work the same way by introducing a neutron flux to a reactive energy multiplying element.Inertial confinement fusion reactors detonate small pellets of fusion fuel to pro...","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,677,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-case-scenario-in-a-meltdown-of-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-knowing-that-its-temperature-can-be-up-to-70-million-degrees-centigrade-which-is-over-5-times-hotter-than-the-Sun
1,"The very hot stuff inside would stop fusion immediately. As such all the heat it has would be the heat stored in its mass. Since the mass of the hot plasma is relatively small compared to the mass of the housing and other components, all of the heat energy will be expended on slagging only a certain portion of the contaimnent. And one the heat energy is expended melting and slightly heating a portion of the containment, it stops.The same way a white hot nail if dropped into a swimming pool filled with cold water would have little overall effect on the average temp of the pool water.","2,795 followers",Frank Popa,946,9.1K,4.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-case-scenario-in-a-meltdown-of-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-knowing-that-its-temperature-can-be-up-to-70-million-degrees-centigrade-which-is-over-5-times-hotter-than-the-Sun

13,"it is possible to build a profitable fusion reactor without relying on the gravitational confinement provided by the mass and heat of the sunMankind currently is in possession of a practical working fusion technology.(A fusion driver producing X-rays irradiates and implodes a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere on the left, which initiates a D-T fusion burst which in turn launches a shock detonation wave down a cylinder of pressurized liquid deuterium)It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such wiit is possible to build a profitable fusion reactor without relying on the gravitational confinement provided by the mass and heat of the sunMankind currently is in possession of a practical working fusion technology.(A fusion driver producing X-rays irradiates and implodes a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere on the left, which initiates a D-T fusion burst which in turn launches a shock detonation wave down a cylinder of pressurized liquid deuterium)It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is** not justified**.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test of 1952 that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion while using nuclear fission to reliably bring Deuterium fusion plasma to fusion conditions.There is an existing practical fusion technology that efficiently produces large industrially significant amounts of fusion energy on demand - we just do not choose to develop it and commercially use it.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).**“So why aren’t ICF power plants being built?”**Pure Inertial Confinement Fusion that does not use nuclear fission to produce the conditions for fusion is today driver limited.It is still not experimentally possible to build a laser (or ion particle accelerator) large enough to produce DT fusion ignition. Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1984 - 1988) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly and produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just theoretically predicted in computer simulations).Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion is different from Magnetic Confinement Fusion and other forms of fusion as ICF fusion has been **PROVEN** experimentally to work.If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.------While wanting to avoid excessive controversy, I would like to point out the following historical facts.**Ivy-Mike fission-fusion ICF technology worked the very first time it was tried in 1952.**There was no gradual trail of experimental failures on the road to ICF fission-fusion leading to a final success after many experimental tries. Historically, ICF fission-fusion worked right from the first experimental attempt (Ivy-Mike test - 1952) and produced controlled reliable release of fusion energy with energy gain right from the first experiment.Ivy-Mike ICF fission-fusion technology has historically **never failed** to work while producing fusion energy with enormous energy gain.Fission-fusion ICF technology was the basis of the first thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal. Adapting fission-fusion technology to be pure hybrid DT-DD fusion opens up many new applications in economical power generation.Fission-fusion technology worked the first time it was tried and produced huge amounts of net energy with engineering fusion gain not only greater than one but greater than 10^5 or 100,000X (and has never failed in over 800 underground tests at the Nevada Test Site).Rather than placing our faith in scaling laws while we build ever larger and more expensive MCF fusion experiments while trying to achieve break even energy generation -Why not go back to the field and adapt proven Inertial Confinement Fusion technology to operate as pure fusion, employing a modern fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) capable of delivering in excess of 20 MJ to the fusion capsule while avoiding use of a fission primary?Why not adapt and modify working ICF fusion technology that has never failed in the field rather than sink all current fusion funding into Magnetic Confinement Fusion approaches which in hundreds of MCF fusion devices around the world and in hundreds of thousands of shots has consistently failed to even once produce break-even fusion energy?References -NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests - Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists (The following document contains what Senior LLNL researcher John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE“Development of the Indirect Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain” John Lindl.

14,"No, the laws of scale prevent this from happening.  You see fissile material undergoes reactions proportional to the radius cubed (the volume), but it loses neutrons proportional to the square (the surface area).  Roughly speaking.That means a small amount, like a grape, has far less volume than it has surface area, which means it loses neutrons far faster than the neutrons can multiply and react.

Roughly speaking.That means a small amount, like a grape, has far less volume than it has surface area, which means it loses neutrons far faster than the neutrons can multiply and react.    As you make the chunk larger, the amount that react goes up faster than the amount that leave, so when you get to a certain size, around 7 kilograms for plutonium, 50kg for U235, the reaction can run on its own.   Those are the minimum amounts of fissile material you can get to react by themselves.  You can cut this amount down by a factor of eight or so by special tricks, like compressing the heck out of the material and surrounding it with lots of reflexive material, but that's impractical for anything other than a bomb.So a small nuclear reactor, not possible.   The smallest one I know of is the one that was put in an airplane, and that one was still like 20 tons, and it only had minimal shielding, on the side towards the cockpit.   On all the other sides, it was emitting 30,000 rads per second, fatal to anything within a mile or two.   The radiation was so high, that just the forward scattering into the air in front of the cockpit required a windshield that was 10 inches thick.The smallest bomb we know of was the ""Davy Crockett"" backpack munition, about 25 kilos.  Again, not practical for powering anything.Well there is another possibility, you can take nuclear waste and refine out some short-lived isotopes which have fantastic amounts of radioactivity, so they naturally get like orange-hot-- you can use the heat to heat up some thermocouples and that will generate SMALL amounts of electricity.  That's the power source for like interstellar probes like Voyager.    But those are not very practical, the radioactivity is just insane.   If you smashed the phone they'd have to evacuate a few square miles.  And the USA and USSR at least have stopped refining nuclear waste so the stuff just isn't available anymore.   Maybe you can get some from North Korea.So, no nuclear-powered phones.

So if the reactor produces 3 kW, the car would be limited to a 9mph top speed!However, if the car still had a decent battery pack, the nuclear reactor could recharge it overnight by about 90 miles in 10 hours - which is enough for most people’s commute.Failing that - fitting 10 bowling balls into the trunk of the car would get you a 90mph car without needing batteries…and the reactors would last longer than the car itself, so it would never need refueling or recharging.[[UPDATE]] :But it would take 7 tonnes of fuel rods (which are insanely radioactive) to get enough Americium for ONE of those reactors.
