The vast majority of starships have more than a single reason for existence. Everything from the lightest of cruisers to the heaviest of dreadnoughts (almost never actually called that, btw) was designed to serve multiple functions simultaneously. No expenses would be spared to achieve crew and mission efficiency, which is why the ships tended to evoke a “luxury liner” aesthetic even while remaining capable in most-everything, including waging war. On that topic in particular: Federation ships eschewed cloaking devices in favor of more powerful sensors and computers, tied in with overlapping weapon firing arcs such that the only way a ship could realistically be caught flat-footed is if the crew was asleep at the wheel.The Cardassians’ design hat was utilitarian to the extreme, which made sense given that they basically were a resource-starved military junta. Almost everything had to have a very good reason for existing on a Cardassian ship, and since their ships were unabashedly warships, this meant forward firing arcs concentrated in a small area for maximizing weight of fire while minimizing exposure, engines in the rear protected by broad forward flanks that would soak up incoming fire (compared to Federation engine nacelles which were obvious and easy to hit).The Romulans make for an interesting comparison, because their hat was form and function in equal measure. Their ships all have a deliberately intimidating design aesthetic, and just enough flourish in the designs to all but scream “we can waste money on this shit, so fear us and our power.”But the Klingons?The Klingons deliberately held onto outdated, ancient designs, rarely improving on things that “just worked.” What worked for Kahless would work for anyone several thousand years later. Their hat was brute functionality in large quantity, which fit the image of an empire built on equal parts exploratory conquest and near-constant infighting, with a nominal imperial navy supplemented by the personal fleets of each noble house. Said outdated designs would continue to be fielded in massive numbers because the Klingons understood that quantity was a quality of its own, and one thing they never really lacked was a shortage of young, stupid, bloodthirsty warriors hungry for battle and glory. No creature comforts because Real Warriors Don’t Need Soft Beds, no hygiene, medical facilities that rival Earth’s dark ages, that specifically because the Klingons didn’t really need them, just enough functionality to bring all weapons to bear and, barring that, ramming speed, as returning from battle alive wasn’t necessarily the most optimal outcome.And then, of course, the Borg. Geometric design aesthetic, at least for their ships. Simple shapes, firing arcs everywhere, redundancy up the wazoo, but like the Klingons, built for a single purpose. For the Klingons, it was death in glorious combat. For the Borg, assimilation.Late tl;dr: Star Trek is a setting combining progressive politics, geopolitical analogues, technobabble, military wank, space vikings, space dinosaurs, and a space viral zombie apocalypse that still somehow manages to take itself seriously. It's a given that characters in the setting would, sooner or later, notice odd inconsistencies in how badly-designed their universe is. The Federation and the Cardassian Union are two sides of the “only sane man"" trope understanding the reasons for each other's design philosophies, coming to grips with space vikings.",232 followers,Neil Sharpson,942,926,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-China-make-their-own-CPUs-for-their-supercomputer

Their own bodies reference that mindset with what they callWhile this level of redundancy does provide more points of failure, it also bestows phenomenal levels of damage resistance; a Klingon warrior can easily take the kind of punishment that would kill a Human, Romulan or Vulcan in the same situation. This redundancy stretches to their technology; vital systems are protected by multiple backups and redundancies, allowing for their ships to take horrendous battle damage and still be partially operational (and thus, to the Klingon mind, able to fight on). It is this setup that renders most Klingon tech very odd to the outside observer - they don't have that mindset of ‘everything has to be able to survive in battle'.",10 followers,Leigh Hogan,725,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-China-make-their-own-CPUs-for-their-supercomputer

In order to support the family’s financial, my mom worked as a tailor at home. Sometimes people do not pay her even until today, there are people who still have debts. Hence, the income is quite unstable, but for some reasons, we have enough of everything even though everything is quite tight and being frugal became a habit for me. My mom never remarried because she told me, my father is her first and the best man she ever met.At home.We have no TV, if we wanted to watch one, we can always visit the neighbor, only during the day. My father was an avid reader, so we have a rack of books in our home which I’ve read those for several times since there is nothing to do if we weren’t playing the paddy field. Sometimes, I made my own toys that I saw from books in the school library.Chicken was very expensive. But sometimes my mom bought a leg quarter for 9 of us to share. Eating rice with budu (anchovy sauce) was common, well sometimes with kicap (soy sauce). We weren’t allowed to eat instant noodle or any junk food.New dress was once a year, during Hari Raya, and it was only one for each person. We bought the cloth using our saved school allowance and my mom would tailor it for us. As for daily clothes, we sometimes received used shirts and pants from my aunts who lived in Perlis.At school.My daily allowance is 50 cents during elementary and RM 1.50 in middle school. I only spent if I’m really hungry besides there’s always RMT (rancangan makanan tambahan) given in the morning. In elementary school, I walked to school with my little brothers for 1.5 miles, and if we got lucky other kind parents will pick us up to school. Then in middle school, the bus ride costed 50 cents one way. Hence, on average, I still have 50 cents in my pocket which is not enough to buy food at the middle school canteen (they tend to charge higher price compared to elementary school). After some times, I asked to stay in the dormitory which was granted so my mom had to pay only RM 30 per month to the school. It did save a lot of money because those 30 ringgits covered all food expenses. (The students were allowed to go home every two weeks). At this time, we were all in school (2 in universities and 4 in high school and 2 in elementary school). So my mom needed to save more money. I never went to cram school (Tuition Center) to get higher results, but thank God, I did outperform others.After school and getting out of my kampong.I received scholarship after SPM to study either in Japan or in the U.S, I chose U.S. because I’m already familiar with English. Then, I continued my study till doctorate. I managed to get out of poverty and brought my mom out of our old place. My other siblings are doing good as well.I remember my mom saying, we might not have money but we must have knowledge to change ourselves.",0 followers,Clay Reynolds,714,1.2K,4.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-China-make-their-own-CPUs-for-their-supercomputer

23,"You will still need to put your ""The Machine"" somewhere, and it's going to want power, network connectivity and cooling.    It will end up somewhere that looks a lot like a data center.Because ""The Machine"" does frequent memory access across a network, the cpus can't be very far (10s or maybe 100s of meters) from the memory to avoid long latency delays.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",191 followers,Brandon Berryhill,567,92,631.8K,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-China-make-their-own-CPUs-for-their-supercomputer
