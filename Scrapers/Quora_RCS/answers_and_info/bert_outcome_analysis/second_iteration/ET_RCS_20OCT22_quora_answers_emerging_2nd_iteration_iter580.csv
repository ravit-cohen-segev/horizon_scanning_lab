Apparently he was some kind of early Spartan. If I’m getting this wrong, please correct (and teach) meSpartan 1:Spartan 1’s are like one step above normal soldiers. Nowhere near the powerhouses the 2’s are. Their Warhammer 40k equivalent would be an Imperial Guardsmen. Elite soldiers with special training that face the horrors of the galaxy and come out on top.Vs the might of the Space Marines.Let’s quickly go over the stats of the Space Marines:Ok now for the match ups:In 40k lore, a small squad of Guardsmen can kill a chaos space marine with little to no trouble. However this is due to their Lasgun rifles being stupidly powerful (when used properly) & the Guard having entire combat doctrines dedicated to fighting Space Marines.Spartan 1’s are no doubt skilled combatants. However their standard 7.62 rifles are not able to penetrate even the weakest Astartes armor, nor would they have any training or readiness for the combat situation.I believe it would take anywhere from 20–30 Spartan 1’s to take a Space Marine down. Whether it be one of them grabs a heavy weapon like a Rocket Launcher and the marine can’t dodge in time and gets hit. However even then the marine can take about 3 rockets before he drops. Of the 20–30 Spartans, I believe at least 15 of them will be killed in the process. However the marine may very well kill them all.Now for Spartan 2’s.I like to call these guys Mini Space Marines. VERY impressive soldiers.When comparing a Spartan 2 to a Space Marine, think of the Space Marine’s stats but worse. Space Marines are bigger, stronger, smarter, (sometimes) faster, their armor and weapons are FAR superior.I believe it would take 4–5 Spartan 2’s to take down a Space Marine, my reason for this (for that one idiot that’s gonna leave a comment going “NO A SINGLE SPARTAN 2 CAN LITERALLY KILL EVERY SPACE MARINE EVER REEEEEEEEE” )Yeah sure and Master Chief can kill the Emperor.Anyway, Let’s take the fight with Atriox in Halo Wars 2.3 Spartan 2’s got their asses annihilated by this guy. Atriox only letting them go for… plot? I think he was looking for their base or something idkThe point is Atriox toyed with them, taunted them, let them go. A Space Marine wouldn’t do any of those things. First and foremost, Space Marines would shit on Atriox. I made a post about that a while ago if anyone wants to find the question.Secondly, as said, the Marine wouldn’t waste his time with talk, or staring down his foes. The Spartans would not have gotten the chance to gain their bearings or even comprehend what is going on. Placing a Marine in place of Atriox, the fight would’ve lasted seconds at most.So with that in mind, also realize Spartan 2’s have the same issue the 1’s have. Their standard issue rifles would have no effect on the marine’s armor. They’d have to punch, kick, and use anti tank weaponry like the Spartan Laser & Rocket Launcher to kill the marine.Assuming 6 Spartans meet the marine in a fight, I believe they would take him down. However I also believe at least 1/2 of those Spartans would die.As powerful as the 2’s are, they’re no match for the Space Marines.As for the 3’s:They’re downgraded 2’s. Same issues with the weapons, to keep it quick:10 Spartan 3’s meet the marine, I think at least 5 of them would die. Maybe closer to 6–7.Conclusion:Spartans are VERY powerful soldiers. They’re very cool soldiers! But you gotta remember 2 things:1: Halo is a universe about humanity’s last stand. Spartans were made to give humanity a chance against a relentless onslaught(shut up about the real purpose of Spartans I don’t care about the rebellions)2: In Warhammer 40k, humanity IS the relentless onslaught. Space Marines are made to kill Aliens twenty stories high, demons, and god like beings.Of course the Spartan’s aren’t gonna stand a chance. They’re not supposed to! That doesn’t make Spartans weak, it’s just that Space Marines are so over the top and wacky that it’s not even fair comparing the two.",4 followers,Phil Lang,852,4K,7M,https://www.quora.com/How-many-Halo-Spartans-would-it-take-to-defeat-a-WH40k-Space-Marine

A spartan is capable of flipping an elephant over after it has flipped onto its side, meaning that they are powerful. They are also durable, possessing shields that regenerate and powerful armor. I know it is dumb to say, but the master chief detonated a nuke a stones throw from himself, only to survive and walk it off. Spartans do not get credit for their survivability.Space marines are often trained from birth to fight and have blessed weaponry, and while I am inclined to note the spartan’s weaponry, it would never stack up one on one, but they possess the weapons to break space marine armor. Spartans are also usually best when in teams, even with regular soldiers instead of other Spartans. They fight best that way and they are essentially fearless.The problem with space marines is that they are cocky, thinking of themselves as higher up than regular humans, whereas Spartans don't in the big picture, even if some hold space marine style views.All you need is some good teamwork, good firepower, and the Spartans could do it casualty free.",0 followers,Christopher Bowers,788,1.2K,5.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-many-Halo-Spartans-would-it-take-to-defeat-a-WH40k-Space-Marine

I don’t remember what happened in detail but basically it turned out to be a trick and a bomb was planted on a Blood Angel’s ship and killed nearly 100 Blood Angels.Sanguinius then continued the invasion, this time allowing his legion to let loose. The Spartan like soldiers were ripped apart with the Space Marine’s bare hands and the planet’s resistance was slaughtered.In the end, the Blood Angels felt bad about what happened. They’d wish the planet had simply succumbed to the Imperium, the planet’s super soldiers would’ve made for a valuable war asset.Space Marines would definitely respect the likes of the Spartans. Especially the Spartan 2’s. However they would not allow their respect to blind them into showing mercy.

4,"Assuming both have standard issue gear (tactical marine vs standard loadout Spartans)? A single 4 to 6 man squad could do the job, potentially casualty free if they’ve got time to plan. Spartans have reaction times easily on par with the Eldar in the fluff and they have extensive close combat training, not enough to confidently take on the Space Marine in CQC simply due to the Space Marine’s dramatically greater emphasis on that area of combat as well as his power armor and chainsword but definitely enough to not be ground to bloody paste the moment that chainsword gets within 3 feet of them,Assuming both have standard issue gear (tactical marine vs standard loadout Spartans)?

The huge, huge advantage that the Space Marine has is that the Spartans are armed with MA5 assault rifles firing modern-day 7.62 ammunition. In other words, it makes the basic lasgun look like an unstoppable rape machine and may as well fire jelly beans by WH40k standards. However, it IS powerful enough to (eventually) bring the Space Marine down with concentrated fire to the joints, which the Spartans are more than capable of pulling off with professionalism and ease in most any given situation. Nonetheless if the Space Marine can draw a solid bead on one of the Spartans with his boltgun, then that Spartan is incapacitated at absolute best and is in fact most likely very, very dead. Thus, more concealing terrain more and more favors the Spartans.",0 followers,Alexander Novak,837,52,598K,https://www.quora.com/How-many-Halo-Spartans-would-it-take-to-defeat-a-WH40k-Space-Marine

The S2s were augmented supersoldiers that could change the tide of battles.Strategy/experience:I know I’ve written another answer to a very similar question, but this time I plan on giving the overview of each opponent, then giving my verdict and a quick fight, so please bear with me.SPARTAN II[Image from google]The standard Spartan IIs were considered demons by the enemies of the UNSC and saviors by its citizens. The S2s were augmented supersoldiers that could change the tide of battles.Strategy/experience:Armor + Augmented abilities:Weapons:Overall Capabilities:ADEPTUS ASTARTES [Dark Angels chapter] (A tactical marine, NOT A PRIMARIS):The Emperor’s angels of death, the Adeptus Astartes (AKA space marines) are feared and revered across the Imperium, with single Astartes changing the outcome of entire campaigns. The Astartes are transhuman warriors who are genetically crafted to be the perfect weapons of the Imperium’s wrath.Strategies/Experience:Armor & Augmentations:Weapons & Equipment:Overall capabilities:Verdict:The Spartan IIs, while certainly being formidable supersoldiers of their universe, are simply not as powerful as the transhuman warriors that are the Adeptus Astartes. The enhancements, arms, armaments, and the experience of an average Tactical Marine outmatch the Spartan II in pretty much every aspect.Where a Spartan 2 would be overwhelmed by enemies, an Astartes would have already killed them; where a Spartan 2 could barely overwhelm a hunter in strength, an Astartes would be able to punch through the wall of a tank; where a Spartan 2 would speed blitz a group of enemies, an Astartes would have already killed them all. Where a Spartan 2 would die from loss of limbs, an Astartes wouldFight:Round 1:[Location: hanger of a Venator, with a few ruined starfighters & tanks lying around][There is a missile launcher beneath one of the ruins]Begin:Separated from his squad, the Spartan 2 continues onwards to the rendezvous point, making note of the destruction he sees as he approaches the hanger of this ship. As he enters the hanger, a bolter round slams into his chest, knocking him over and almost disabling his energy shield. Quickly, the Spartan roles behind nearby wreckage before popping back up, scanning his surroundings, and opening fire on the Astartes across the hanger. The extra second he took to find the Astartes was his undoing, however, as another bolter round strikes him in the head barely a second after he popped up.Knocked over again, and with his shields destroyed, the Spartan quickly recovers and hurls a grenade over the wreckage. As the explosion goes off, he dives out from behind his cover and opens fire again, only to be struck by another bolter round, which knocks him backward and destroys a large portion of the MJOLNIR armor on his torso. Quickly, the Spartan activates his bubble shield and looks around, seeing a missile launcher partially obscured under another nearby wreck. As three bolter rounds slam into the bubble shield (which still holds), the Spartan makes a dive for the missile launcher, only for a fourth round to slam into his chest, ending him instantly.The Astartes makes his way over to the fallen soldier and carefully picks up the bubble shield generator, before receiving new orders over the vox and dashing off to regroup with his squadron.Round 2:[Location: Jedi Temple hallway][Spartan Laser behind one pillar, Sniper rifle behind another]Begin:The Spartan jogs into the hallway and almost immediately dives behind one of the columns as a hail of bolder rounds flies past him. Returning fire from behind his cover, the Spartan’s AI notifies him of a Spartan Laser behind another one of the pillars as another round of bolter fire rips large chunks out of his cover. With practiced skill, the Spartan hurls a frag down the hall before making a dash for the pillar with the Spartan Laser. With equal skill, his own grenade is hurled right back at the pillar he was just standing behind, and a bolter round catches his left arm as he takes cover behind the new column, damaging his energy shield. As the Spartan picks up the Spartan Laser and begins to charge it, he hears what sounds like a brief series of clicking noises and the sound of something else being charged.As the Spartan prepares to aim and fire the Laser, a round from the Tactical Marine’s overcharged Plasma pistol obliterates both the column and the Spartan 2 himself, with only the legs of the Spartan remaining standing for a second before falling to the ground, lifeless.Round 3 (melee attempt):[Random sci-fi hallway][No other weapons]Begin:Both opponents appear at opposite ends of the hallway and both open fire immediately as the Space Marine charges forwards and the Spartan ducks back out of the opening. Bullets bounce harmlessly off of the Space Marine as he reaches the end of the hallway in mere seconds, catching the Spartan off guard. Quickly, the Marine punches with his fist, sending the Spartan flying backward and stunning him. In less than a second, the Marine draws his knife and lunges forward as the Spartan tries to regain his bearings. The Spartan manages to barely dodge the first knife blow, but not the Marine’s armored foot, which connects with the Spartan’s head, dealing massive trauma to the Spartan, who is almost killed outright. Quickly and lethally, so as not to waste ammo or dirty his knife, the Astartes stomps down on the Spartan’s now broken helmet and head, ending the fight instantly.Verdict part 2:As demonstrated, the Astartes overwhelmed the Spartan, who couldn’t move fast enough to use his smaller stature to his advantage and couldn’t take enough hits to deal out any lasting damage himself. The win clearly goes to the Adeptus Astartes.Sources:Warhammer 40k wikiHalo WikiGoogle [for the images]",4 followers,Alex Boast,892,559,1.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-many-Halo-Spartans-would-it-take-to-defeat-a-WH40k-Space-Marine

The Covenant slowly but resolutely goomba-stomps the rest of humanity because there's no heroic supersoldiers to save the day. Subsequent generations of Covenant citizens look back on the conquest with patriotic pride and shudder when they think about that one battle with the thirty-ought giant batshit screaming humans who wrecked everyone's day and died unceremoniously.The thing about the Adeptus Astartes is that they're hyper-specialized for frontline combat. Everything about them - their gene seed, their armor, their weapons, their combat doctrine - is designed to dish out and tank as much damage as physically possible. They will stand in the meat grinder and unleash hell until the enemy is dead or they are. More often than not, it's the former.But the Human-Covenant war was more than a series of head-on charges. Sabotage, reconnaissance, assassination, guerilla warfare, infiltration, VIP extraction. These and more were just as common and often more important than frontline engagements. Missions like these required cunning, adaptability, versatility, subtlety. Spartans were all these things. Commandoes who could fill any role and do it better than anyone else. Space Marines, however, are 8-foot tall behemoths with guns the size of ponies who shake the earth with each step and scream dogma at their enemies. They aren't exactly built for subtlety. They would win every frontal assault. But the second you stuck one in one of the delicate black ops missions Spartans thrive at, he would fail miserably and probably get a plasma torpedo dropped on his head for the trouble.And that's just the ground stuff. Cycling out thirty Spartan-II's with thirty Astartes changes f*ck-all about the space engagements, which humanity was still cripplingly weak at. Even replacing all the II's, III's and Orions with Astartes wouldn't have mattered in the long run. Space Marines are devastatingly effective at a handful of things. But Spartans are extremely effective at a wide variety of things. And it's that versatility that made them so potent. It's that versatility that won the day in the long run.UPDATE 11/01/21""In ancient times, men built wonders, laid claim to the stars and sought to better themselves for the good of all. But we are much wiser now.""Oh, the young and foolish. After nearly four more years down the 40k rabbit hole, this answer makes me want to relax in a Jacuzzi filled with burning promethium. Alright, time to fix this.Space marines outstrip Spartans in ability and equipment. They are eight foot tall gene warriors who spit acid and breathe vacuum and don’t care about arbitrary concepts like “gaping hole” and “missing limbs.” They’re clad in what could be described as a man-portable pillbox made of unobtanium that is designed to eat tank rounds and shrug off plasma. Their favorite weapons include an automatic RPG that turns armored opponents to mist and a chainsaw made of knives hard enough and sharp enough to chew through solid diamond. Despite being refrigerator-sized transhumans that weigh as much as two cows stacked on top of one another, space marines can move faster than the eye can process and can outrun an incoming missile. An Astartes would crack open a Spartan like a can of pringles, eat his head, digest his memories and use those memories to obtain the Spartan’s WiFi password.Basically, if a space marine acted the same way as a Spartan, he’d do it a hundred times better.But that’s the caveat: IF a space marine acted the same way as a Spartan. And this brings us to the Codex.The Codex Astartes, the military treatise that mandates how space marines organize and conduct themselves, can generally be regarded as the 40k equivalent to Spartan combat doctrine. It’s basically a mix of Art of War and the Holy Bible. Every space marine chapter has a different approach to adopting the Codex. Some, like the Ultramarines or Hammers of Dorn, hold the Codex as holy writ and adhere to it religiously. Others, like the Crimson Fists or Carcharodons, have a more liberal interpretation of the Codex and bend the rules as necessary. And there are some like the Black Templars and Space Wolves who have a passing respect for the Codex at best but otherwise ignore it entirely and do their own thing.The reason why the Codex is important is because it covers a lot of things but DOESN’T cover everything. And a lot of what it covers and mandates can be exceptionally well-planned and pragmatic or pants-on-head stupid and careless. So how a space marine behaves while filling in as a Spartan largely depends on the Codex compliance of his native chapter.An all-in chapter like the Ultramarines would be highly disciplined with a strategy for almost everything but would suffer from a crippling lack of improvisation when faced with something the Codex doesn’t account for, which is likely in Halo where a space marine is a fish out of water. Likely to do well until their first big trip-up, in which case they fail and fail hard.A dissonant chapter could theoretically be anything, but in the case of my two earlier examples (Black Templars and Space Wolves), they would actually be pretty similar to my 2018 description of space marines: melee-obsessed murdermachines who charge into the thick of it en masse and hack everything to pieces. Excellent shock troops, but with the exception of Space Wolf scouts, not at all accustomed to the roles Spartans are meant to take and likely to die in their first engagement without support from other military forces. Especially if they’re only thirty strong like Spartans are.Your best bet would be a chapter that obeys the Codex but doesn't follow it blindly. These would be adaptable and skilled, with a wide knowledge base and the ability to improvise as the situation demands. They can be scouts, saboteurs, assassins, commandos, shock troops: everything a Spartan needs to be. In this case, they could be the heroes humanity needs.Side note: don’t try to randomize marines from different chapters. Unless they have a unique system akin to the Deathwatch, it’ll be pure chaos. Space marine chapters are often so wildly different in culture and doctrine that there’d be little hope for cohesion. They could work together, but never with the same coordination as chapter brothers, let alone Spartans.",43 followers,Aiken Sharratt,574,149,162.8K,https://www.quora.com/How-many-Halo-Spartans-would-it-take-to-defeat-a-WH40k-Space-Marine

Making them stronger, faster, and all around more abled in combat. Same thing with Space Marines.However it is the durability I want to talk about. Of both the armor & the soldiers themselves.In Halo lore, Spartans are killed commonly by weapons considered weak by 40k standards. Plasma rifles, brute shots, plasma pistols, 7.62 rounds, .50 cals. Their armor is impressive. But weak by comparison.Space Marine armor is nearly impenetrable by small arms fire. Take the lasgun for instance.This rifle here can blow off limbs, explode body parts, and set you on fire. Powered up, it can punch through the most dense materials in the galaxy.This is considered weak by 40k standardsLasgun fire cannot penetrate space marine armor, see the image belowThis is a Space Marine literally standing still tanking dozens of shots while calmly firing his bolter back at the turret.Sum it up so far: In durability & ballistics, the Spartan is impressive for Halo. But stands no chance against Space Marines.I could stop here but I’m not going to.Now we must talk about reflexes, tactics, andWhen it comes to reflexes, Spartans are VERY fast. Space Marines are SLIGHTLY faster, literally SLAPPING BULLETS OUT OF THE AIR.When it comes to tactics, Spartans are used by the UNSC military as chess pieces. They take orders from common officers as attachments to regular platoons of marines.Space Marine chapters operate to their own accord. Oftentimes chapters will sendChaplin Grimaldus is placed in charge of an entire hive city. Monitoring everything from the readiness and positioning of city defenses, to the rations and guardsmen numbers within the city. He oversees it all for 9 days.And when it comes to melee, there is nothing the Spartan can do to compete with the marine. It’ll always end the same way.Your super soldiers are very impressive, Halo fans. However ours are simply better.But there’s a reason for that. Halo as a whole is a story about humanity trying to survive against the relentless onslaught of a superior foe. Spartans are made to give humanity a chance! Warhammer 40k isn’t about that at all. In Warhammer, humanity is the relentless onslaught. Space Marines are not realistic, they’re no dramatic, they’re made to be cool.

One of the bitter squabbles you will find in our short history of using computers and an even shorter one using Windows (see what I did there!! ;).Having made the jump to Linux not too long ago, I think I can attest to the fact that theInstead of splitting it up as pros vs. cons, let me provide a context specific answer.Versatility :When it comes to versatility, the unriAhh!! Linux vs. Windows. One of the bitter squabbles you will find in our short history of using computers and an even shorter one using Windows (see what I did there!! ;).Having made the jump to Linux not too long ago, I think I can attest to the fact that theInstead of splitting it up as pros vs. cons, let me provide a context specific answer.Versatility :When it comes to versatility, the unrivaled winner is Linux. It is truly remarkable that you can carry a mobile installation of most Linux distributions and be confident that it will work on almost any computer that you pick.(Although I have heard of such an arrangement also possible with Windows, I don’t have the specifics. I take the lack of public knowledge in this regard as an indication of it’s popularity.)In most cases (excepting GPU drivers), there is absolutely no need for the user to fret over driver issues. Adding printers to your system does not take more than 5 min.Low spec systems (typically old) can be effectively reused.But I will concede this. Updating BIOS is a pain-in-the-a$$ with Linux.Ease of use :Now this is a very personal choice and frankly it is very difficult to objectively decide. Nevertheless, in my opinion Windows would be ideal for beginners who have had no exposure to computers. I am even willing to go on a leg and claim that the average user will also be better suited with Windows. However, Linux appears and it always has been the choice of developers and power users (read it advanced users!!). Let me explain my verdict.The Linux environment has a certain learning curve, which to some extent is a little steep. Therefore, the average user who just wants to surf the web or do productivity tasks may not have the initiative to break his neck over this. But this scenario is fast changing. As I mentioned earlier, versatility seems to be the ‘mantra’. Gone are the days when installing any Linux distro was the niche sport of geeks (nothing I would know, just hear-say). So maybe in a few years time, my suggestion might be different with a little help from ubuntu.However, in the hands of the right user, Linux just transforms into a force to be reckoned with. In fact my personal experience is one of feeling handicapped in Windows after having used Linux.Then there is the issue ofAll in all I will call it a tie in this round.Customization :Once again a Linux stronghold or is it?This again is a very subjective comparison. Most users are content with normal visuals and performance. Then again it doesn’t hurt if it is easy to do. Windows is king here. You can find an app to customize almost anything. However, once again if you have some spare time and the initiative, the sky is the limit in Linux both in terms of aesthetics and performance .Nevertheless I will side with Windows on this one, despite my better judgment. The reason is simple. Most users don’t care if the sky is the limit. All they want is to make their life a little easy, with the least of efforts. Therefore Windows it is.Gaming :Once the stronghold of Windows, the initiative by Steam has certainly left the Windows camp with very little to offer. A significant number of games have become Linux compatible including the likes of CS:Go, Dota2 to name a few. The improved efficiency of linux GPU drivers is certainly a shot in the arm for the Linux gaming community, which today has a thriving user base.So I am inclined to calling it 60–40 in favor of Windows.Productivity :The deep penetration of Microsoft Office into administration and our very lives is testament to the effort by Microsoft. Even today most people would have a hard time even imagining their life without MS Office. Yes, LibreOffice is a very good alternative, and by no means an inferior one. However, compatibility issues project it in very bad light. That is not their problem nor Microsoft’s to be frank. But it is certainly an issue. LaTex on the other hand is whole different story.When it comes to content creation, Windows still appears the clear choice, although there are lot of potent alternatives in Linux with the likes of Gimp(photo editing), KdenLive (video editing) etc.So, once again it’s a tie.To finalize this rather long answer (sorry for that), there are both pros and cons to using Linux over Windows. The reason I have explicitly mentioned each and everyone of these is so I may provide some of the things that I have come across. So please feel free to tick all the boxes you like and do let me know if you feel I have been too biased in my assessment!!AG",58 followers,Samuel Brekke,1.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-many-Halo-Spartans-would-it-take-to-defeat-a-WH40k-Space-Marine

The new coronary pneumonia CT imaging intelligent diagnosis platform built on the Tianhe-2 can complete a CT image diagnosis in 15 seconds, making a major contribution to the fight against the epidemic.A high performance supercomputer is one of the important indexes to measure the comprehensive national strength and technological development level of a country and plays an important role in war simulation, weapon development, simulated nuclear test explosion, space satellites and other military applications, meteorology, physics, detection, material science and computing nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, in-depth learning, biomedicine, genetic engineering, and financial analysis, …, etc.The high-performance computing science and industry were started late in China. Thus, it takes the Chinese scientists and engineers time to catch up with those leading countries. In order for the high-performance computing to catch up as soon as possible, Xiao Liquan, the Deputy Chief Designer of Tianhe No. 2, who is in charge of the communication direction of the Tianhe team, has worked hard for 30 years on the research and development projects.At the end of the 20th century, electrical interconnection technology was usually used in large-scale high-performance computer systems, and the information transmission rate was slow and susceptible to interference, which affected the stability of the system. The best solution is to replace electrical interconnection with optical interconnection.After many failures, finally, the optical interconnection technology has been effectively verified in large-scale high-performance computer systems, which has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent application of this technology in supercomputer systems. In June, 2013, the Tianhe II was successfully developed and took the top place in supercomputer rankings of the world.In November, 2013, in order to upgrade the Tianhe No. 2 system, Xiao Liquan and his team members launched a 10 month intensive research and strived to complete the localized replacement of the core components. After this round of research, Xiao Liquan led the Tianhe team to greatly improve the performance of the Tianhe-2 high-speed interconnection communication system, making it run twice as fast as the international commercial interconnection system at the time, laying the foundation for the development of the next generation of Chinese supercomputers.For a long time, the leading countries have implemented strict technological blockades on China in the high technology field. It has been difficult to solve the software and hardware problems of China because the information system were controlled by the foreign high tech leaders. The chip is not but the IP and kernel are the core technology.Computing speed (commonly known as computing power) and power consumption are the core indicators of supercomputer chips. It is generally for the Chinese scientists and engineers in research and development to simply integrate more transistors in the chip if they want to achieve higher computing power, but that will increase the chip area and power consumption. The real difficulty in developing a supercomputer chip is to reduce the power consumption of the chip as much as possible while ensuring high computing power.Guo Yang, head of microelectronics of the Tianhe team and researcher at the School of Computer Science, China National University of Defense Technology, has persisted for more than 20 years and finally determined to take the technical route of heterogeneous fusion architecture based on autonomous instruction set. The development of a processor chip with an independent instruction set means that the R&D team must not only develop the chip, but also develop a complete set of software systems such as a supporting compiler and algorithm library to achieve technology leadership. He led the team to overcome a large number of the technical problems in chip design and development of the well-known FeiTeng (飞腾处理器) brand in China. The performance of the FeiTeng processor is more than 10 times higher than the previous generation CPU chips.In 2017, the system upgrade of Tianhe-2 was completed. At that time, more than 4000 FeiTeng chips with the best performance in China were installed in Tianhe-2. At present, the ""Tianhe"" series of supercomputers have fully mastered the five major independent core technologies: the four major chips with independent intellectual property rights and independent operating systems. At present, general-purpose CPU and accelerator CPU, interconnection communication routing chip and interconnection interface chip have been assembled in the ""Tianhe II"" Phase 2 system.The new domestically developed FeiTeng-1000 CPUs were mentioned on 28/10/2010.A variety of fighter jets and missiles embedded with Fei Teng chips were unveiled in celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of China at the military parade in 2019.In 2020, Beidou 3 satellite communications network in orbit, Chang'e 5, flying to the moon, and Tianwen No. 1, flying to Mars are all embedded with the Fei Teng CPUs.Tan Yusong, the head of domestic basic software direction of Tianhe team, researcher of School of Computer, China National University of Defense Technology, has led his team members since 2011 in the development of the Kylin operating system.The Kylin operating system has become the domestically produced operating system with the highest level of security and the most widely used in China, and has been successfully applied to various national defense equipment and key information systems. Recently, servers, desktops, all-in-ones, notebooks, and other products based on the ""Fei Teng"" chip and the Kylin operating system [ https://www.kylinos.cn/ ] have been applied on a large scale in many fields.The Tianhe No. 3 E-Class Prototype System has realized four major independent innovations: three chips: ""Matrix"" many-core processors (Matrix-2000+), interconnect interface chips, router chips; Computing, storage and service nodes, more than ten kinds of PCB circuit boards; new computing processing, high-speed interconnection, parallel storage, service processing, monitoring and diagnosis, infrastructure and other hardware subsystems; system operation, parallel development, application support and synthesis management and other software subsystems.In addition, Chengdu Shenwei develops its own instruction set, specially developed for high-performance computing. Shenwei SW26010 is the first computer chip in China that adopts domestically-developed architecture and has world-class performance.SW26010 adopts 260-core many-core architecture, out-of-order execution architecture, frequency 1.45GHz, the entire processor includes 4 MPE (Management Processing Element) management units, 4 CPE (Computing Processing Element) computing units and 4 MC memory controller units The CPE unit is composed of 64 cores in an 8x8 array, so the total is 260 cores (4x64 4=260). The theoretical floating point performance of SW26010 is as high as 3TFLOPS, SW26010 can directly access main memory. On June 20, 2016, the Sunway Taihu Light only costs 1.8 billion to build because of the use of independent Shenwei 260 many-core processors.The realization of domestically produced independent and controllable CPU is essential to support the development of the national information industry and ensure information security in China. On April 15, 2021, Loongson Zhongke Technology Co., Ltd., which has persisted in independent research and development for 20 years, officially launched LoongArch, an autonomous command system architecture of Loongson and achieved a historic breakthrough.It is not difficult to launch a command system, but the difficult part is the ecological construction. The experience accumulation of the past 20 years has allowed the Chinese scientists and engineers to master 9 abilities. The three basic compilers, are GCC, LLVM, and GOLANG. To master the dominant power of the ecology, the key lies in the capabilities of the virtual machines: Java, JavaScript and .NET. As long as the Loongson autonomous command system supports the above three virtual machines, more than half of the existing application software can be run directly without migration. LoongArch has more than 300 basic instructions and nearly 200 instructions are added to complete the binary translation compatible with x86, ARM and MIPS.LoongArch has also abandoned a lot of the historical burden of MIPS, and added some new functions in combination with new application features to bring 10%-20% performance improvement. At present, the first LoongArch CPU 3A5000 processor chip that supports LoongArch has been successfully taped out.

We are still the weak side, and we have enough reasons to fear. This fear dominates us all the time.A dictatorship that can kill 100,000 Americans but feel nothing happens will never care about the lives of the people of the two countries. The low human rights advantage of the United States makes us tremble. The corruption and madness of the US military let us know that we are facing an irrational opponent. The risk of war far exceeds the fool’s imagination.I can't help but ask:When that day really comes, are we ready?………………………………………………………………This is the reason for fear, and people can't tell right from wrong. Democracy is not about letting people die in pursuit of profit. The understanding of democracy by Westerners has already been distorted. I don’t know when the concept of democracy became the private property of Westerners.“Most American people when they travel abroad seem to make no attempt to get to know the locals, instead they travel in their own isolated groups. Is this an indication of the American preference for isolation from the rest of the world? Being scared of the China makes no sense to me, but indicates paranoia due to a lack of consciousness of how the world and democracy works.”This gave rise to another kind of thinking. All the accusations were not because we did something wrong, but because of deep hatred towards us. The Chinese should work hard as your slaves, not travel and shop around the world. Even if the accusations of democracy are stopped, there will be accusations of human rights. You just need a reason to point your fingers.……………………………………………………………….As you can see, it is human rights accusation. It may be late, but it will never be absent.Believing in fake news or pretending to believe is your right, but I really believe that white immigrants in the United States carried out a genocide plan against Indians.In the name of equality for all, trade in slaves.In the name of anti-terrorism, bomb Afghan weddings.In the name of democracy and freedom, seize the wealth of Iraqis.In the name of the free market, let children die from hunger.America has only one name in God's eyes: Judas.……………………………………………………What scares us most is that you actually want to hate us in the name of democracy and human rights.If we fail, their rule will be even more brutal. The definition of democracy and human rights will be further narrowed. Just as the Soviet Union failed, the Western system became the only meaning of democracy. The United States became the liberator of Auschwitz. The world's largest racist country has become a model of human rights.Are we qualified to be treated as normal and equal human beings, not as demons?We can’t breathe.Like many people, I once thought it was a misunderstanding. It's time to abandon the fantasy. In fact, there is more hatred than misunderstanding.Do so many economic and trade links deepen misunderstandings? Why do the western world misunderstand us more and more?Conflicts of interest and racial superiority cannot be resolved by peaceful protests.Abandon fantasy and prepare for struggle.………………………………………………………………………….I think before blaming China you should shoot the intelligence officials who let China steal classified information again and again. Lest they treason again. If the FBI and the CIA are all shot to death, someone will be innocent, but if only half of them are shot, there must be an omission.Remember, before credibly accusing China, please kill an intelligence officer first.If we fail, the story you tell will become history.Let me tell you something you don't know.In October 1931, US President Hoover gave a public speech in support of Japan's invasion of the three northeastern provinces of China.In 1936, the Japanese Army proposed a hugely costly ""six-year combat preparation plan"" (1937-1942) to deal with future wars against the Soviet Union and China. The United States believed that the plan was aimed at the Soviet Union, so it used various methods such as granting Japanese loans, exporting technology, and supplying strategic materials to provide support for the Japanese Army's expansion and preparation for war. Among them, the American Ford Company provides Japan's modern metallurgical technology, the Rockefeller Consortium helps Japan establish a new electrical industry, and the Mellon Consortium helps Japan's aircraft manufacturing industry to further modernize. In fact, because the large-scale Soviet-Japanese war imagined by the Americans did not break out, the material and financial assistance provided by the United States to Japan eventually turned into guns and ammunition that killed Chinese soldiers and civilians.According to US government statistics, 54.4% of the strategic materials imported by Japan in 1937 came from the US. 92.9% of copper, 91.2% of automobiles and 60.5% of oil, 59.7% of scrap steel, 48.5% of various machinery and engines, and 41.6% of cast iron are imported from the United States.The famous writer and educator Tao Xingzhi delivered a speech when he was leaving the United States: ""I will return to China to participate in the war of resistance. If one day I was killed by a Japanese bomb, please don't forget that 54.4% of my body was bombed by your Americans!”Stimson, who has stepped down as the US Secretary of State, wrote in the ""New York Times"" that the US government only needs to prohibit the United States from supplying materials to Japan, and the Chinese can easily defeat Japanese aggression. 31 U.S. congressmen jointly pointed out: ""We say that Japan has two allies, Germany and Italy. In fact, we are Japan's best allies. Anyone will undoubtedly believe that we are actively participating in Japan's war in China. ""On May 4, 1938, at a rally of five thousand people in Los Angeles, US Congressman Scott said: ""Please note that when Japan is currently killing 1 million people in China, 544,000 was killed by American capital, as an accomplice.""Facing the pressure of public opinion, the US government had to make some official articles. On July 1, 1938, when China was about to enter the second year of the full-scale war of resistance, the US State Department notified the American Aircraft Corporation that the US government did not agree to sell aircraft and aircraft parts to countries that were carrying out indiscriminate bombing. This is the famous ""moral embargo"".What is surprising is that in 1938, when the ""moral embargo"" was implemented, the aircraft sold by the United States to Japan was worth 17.454 million U.S. dollars, which was 702.7% of the 1937 figure. The strangeness is self-evident. After collecting U.S. official data, U.S. economist Hu Dunyuan found that Japan’s acquisition of various strategic materials from the U.S. accounted for the proportion of its total imports from 54.4% in 1937 to 56% in 1938. This is the true attitude of the US government towards China's war of resistance.Chinese will never forget your friendship between The Americans and the Japanese. As you said, we give you the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Let us forget the lies about friendship. Let us remember the truth of history.The war entered into 1938. The huge consumption on the Chinese battlefield forced Japan to implement the ""first munitions mobilization in the China Incident,"" but the production and supplies of munitions still could not meet the needs of the Sino-Japanese war. The satisfaction rate of weapons is 70%, ammunition 60%, aircraft 66%, tanks 27%, light armored vehicles 43%, gas masks 97%, sanitary equipment 90%, veterinary equipment 87%, and marine equipment 80%. From April 1, 1938 to March 31, 1939, Japan was forced to implement the second military mobilization plan, which comprehensively reduced the supply of materials for all industries unrelated to military supplies, and required the citizens to implement “conservation, rationing, recycling” war. Ten major measures such as a simple life, stipulate that 32 kinds of materials such as steel, milled iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, etc., shall be subject to strengthened use restrictions. Even the coach rifles used in Japanese middle schools were taken back and used by the Japanese army. Under such circumstances, if the United States cuts off the supply of strategic materials to Japan, by the end of 1938, the full-scale war of aggression against China launched by Japan will not be able to continue due to exhaustion of resources.Japan suffered a huge defeat on the Chinese battlefield. Forcing Japan to turn to resource-rich Southeast Asia to support its material needs. Let me be straight, the US-Japan ""alliance"" relationship has been challenged. But the United States chose to earn the last coin.According to statistics, in 1939, military supplies exported from the United States to Japan amounted to US$186.9 million, accounting for approximately 86% of the total US exports to Japan that year. Among them, the U.S. exports of scrap iron and steel to Japan that year were 9 times more than in 1938. In 1940, US military supplies exported to Japan amounted to 190 million U.S. dollars, accounting for approximately 84% of all US exports to Japan. From 1937 to 1940, the total value of materials exported from the United States to Japan was US$986.7 million, of which military materials accounted for US$703.9 million.What irony, as potential allies, China and the United States import and export commodities mainly for civilian use. As potential hostile countries, the imports and exports of the United States and Japan are mainly military materials.On September 23, 1940, the Japanese troops stationed in northern French Indochina, their strategic intention to abandon the northward attack on the Soviet Union and turn to resource-rich Southeast Asia was already very obvious. When its own interests were seriously threatened, President Roosevelt ordered on September 26 that year to control the delivery of scrap steel to Japan, but did not mention the issue of oil supply. At this time, the United States still had the illusion that Japan changed its course and went north to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, it has always ""opened the net"" on the oil issue that is vital to Japan.Japanese aircraft rely heavily on petroleum products supplied by the United States.In order to conceal the fact of supplying oil to Japan from the public so that the U.S. government is less criticized by public opinion, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in accordance with the requirements of the State Department, replaced ""aircraft fuel"" with the term ""high-quality fuel for engines"" in trade documents. In the first quarter of 1941, the US aviation gasoline sold to Japan was 131% higher than in the same period in 1940.Until July 22, 1941, when Japanese troops began to occupy the southern part of French Indochina, the United States announced on July 25 that it would freeze all Japanese assets in the United States and imposed a comprehensive embargo on oil and scrap steel. But it was too late. Because in the first seven months of 1941, the pig iron, steel plate, and scrap metal exports from the United States to Japan increased by more than three times in currency terms compared to 1940.Therefore, when the Japanese combined fleet attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, most of the aviation fuel that supported Japanese aircraft flying over Pearl Harbor was provided by the United States. Most of the materials needed to build airplanes and bombs also come from the United States. The United States called this day ""the darkest day"", and President Roosevelt called it ""National Humiliation Day."" But looking at what the United States has done since 1931, it can be said that this is the disgrace of the American policy of appeasement and the result of the greedy American capitalism. Blame it on its own, not worthy of sympathy.China bankrupted the Japan-U.S. strategic alliance through persistent resistance, making the United States compelled to join the anti-Japanese militarism camp in order to defend its strategic interests.The Second World War is not a funny story about American heroes saving the world. You didn't have this ability in the past. By now, you have lost even the ability to solve your own domestic problems. Of course, the United States will never lack super-powered office officials who claim to be able to sink the Chinese fleet in a short time, trade officials who promote the US's quick victory theory, and a president who cannot fulfill his campaign promises.By the way, the great achievements of the U.S. military. Never in human history has an army achieved so many achievements:Harassing pedestrians in South Korea.Caused a major accident in Italy.Gang rape of women in Japan.Bombing children in Iraq.Burning grain fields in Syria.Agent Orange is used in Vietnam.Contest to kill civilians in Afghanistan.Armed police shot civilians wantonly in America.…Be proud.When the U.S. military is constrained by China, guess who is their next target for robbery?Maybe it's Iran, maybe it's Venezuela, maybe it's Belarus.But I think it is you Americans who are most likely to be robbed by the higher US military expenditures.Wish you guys good luck.",101 followers,Anthony Galli,813,298,5.7M,https://www.quora.com/How-many-Halo-Spartans-would-it-take-to-defeat-a-WH40k-Space-Marine

Shouldn’t that say something? The fact that it’s been 242 years and we haven’t had a change to government. Our constitution states “in order to form a more perfect union.” The US, as said before, is not perfect, but no country is. America strives to be a better nation.

Similar to Russia China has significant military flaws.Above all the tactical situation for China would be dire. The US would be able to launch planes from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the Carriers and China would be dangerously exposed. Additionally, with US support China will have a very hard time getting troops into Taiwan and keeping them supplied. US Carrier Strike Groups could easily cut off all overseas shipping and limit China’s mobility.China knows all of this, they aren’t dumb.
