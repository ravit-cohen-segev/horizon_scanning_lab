6,"This is a square:image from wikimediaWhy am I bringing up shapes, you ask? Well, squares have an interesting property: the Pythagorean theorem tells us that the diagonal of this square is equal to the square root of the squared sum of its side (a² = b² + c²). For a square of side 1, this means the diagonal has a length of √2.This scales: make the square bigger, you also make the diagonal longer. Double the length of the sides, you also double the length of the diagonal.Here’s another formula: d = v*t, and one of it’s reciprocals, t = d/v.Electricity travels at a finite speed within a wire: ifThis is a square:image from wikimediaWhy am I bringing up shapes, you ask?

Double the length of the sides, you also double the length of the diagonal.Here’s another formula: d = v*t, and one of it’s reciprocals, t = d/v.Electricity travels at a finite speed within a wire: if you increase the amount of distance to travel, then the amount of time needed to do so will increase. Similarly, if you increase the size of your cache, it will take more time for you to reach the SRAM cells that are farther away.Of course, this is an oversimplification. Caches usually aren’t laid out in a perfect square, and are even broken into many separate banks. But the idea stays the same: if you increase your cache size, signals will need to travel farther on average to access it (seeing as some of these SRAM cells are now farther away from the core).If we look at it in practice:original unmodified image fromThose black lines (added by me) represent the maximum distance a signal would need to travel within the SRAM pool. Notice how much more distance these signals would need to cover if the cache size were to be doubled up.We can conclude: a cache’s small size contributes massively to its speed. Should you make it significantly larger, latency would increase substantially.This is why CPUs have multi-level caches by the way: the low-level caches can be fast, while the L3 can be slower but of larger capacity. This stems from the fact that is is simply not possible to make a cache that is both ultra-fast AND of high capacity.Let’s consider the case for memory too: if you were to replace your traditional CPU DRAM with SRAM, not only would the latency of this SRAM not be as low as in a CPU cache (due to its large size), it would be even worse than that given the fairly large distance signals would need to travel to reach this RAM in the first place (from the CPU to RAM). Physical proximity between the cache and RAM contributes to low latency as well.All and all, using SRAM as main RAM would not bring as much of a speedup as one might think. Given the increased cost of SRAM as well as its lower density vs DRAM, it’s simply not worth it. In the end, you’d sThere’s also power to consider. SRAM doesn’t have to be power hungry: given its asynchronous nature, it can actually be fairly low power. However, strap it to a CPU and make it run at multi-ghz speeds, and things start to get hot.

7,"It is more a question of nomenclature than of what it actually is. Cache memory is, by definition in my opinion, a smaller but faster memory placed between main memory and the CPU. As well as the memory, cache has to include the cache comparison logic.The reason for cache is speed. It is faster to access on chip memory that it is off chip memory. If you can fit all the memory on chip, as many SoCs (System on Silicon) do, there is no need for cache, and those SoCs that don’t have external memory almost always don’t have caches either.But the amount of memory you can fit on one chip is limited.It is more a question of nomenclature than of what it actually is.

Furthermore, the silicon fabrication processes for extremely dense memories are different from those for CPUs and other irregular logic. So if you move memory on chip, it tends to get bigger at the same time as it gets faster.So there is a continually moving sweet spot in memory size below which caches are unnecessary. Unfortunately, software keeps on wanting more and more memory, so that sweet spot keeps moving either way.","3,120 followers",Becca Royal-Gordon,1.1K,4.3K,12M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-reasons-other-than-cost-to-not-replace-RAM-entirely-with-a-cache-of-equal-size-If-cost-is-the-only-reason-we-would-ve-been-able-to-buy-very-expensive-but-super-fast-computers-right

Harder problems usually requires some alternation in the process which you will be able to do, after some practice.Note 2: the source code samples below are written in C++. If you don't know the language or are unsure of something, please ask me in comments.Iteration vs. recursionAfter you read some introductory texts on dynamic programming (which I highly recommend), pretty much all the source code examples in them use bottom-up technique with iteration (i.e. using for-cycles). For example calculating the length of the longest common subsequence of two stringsint dp[N+1][N+1];There are couple of reasons why it is coded in this way:Looking at such source code, one can understand how and why it works, but it is much harder to understand how to come up with it.The biggest breakthrough in my learning of dynamic programming was, when I started to think about the problems in the top-down fashion, instead of bottom-up.On the first look it doesn't look as such a revolutionary insight, but these two approaches directly translates in two different source codes. One uses iteration (bottom-up fashion) and the other one uses recursion (top-down fashion). The latter one is also called the memoization technique. The two solutions are more or less equivalent and you can always transform one into the other.In the following paragraphs I will show you how to come up with a memoization solution for a problem.Motivation problemImagine you have a collection ofBecause the wines get better every year, supposing today is the year 1, on yearYou want to sell all the wines you have, but you want to sell exactly one wine per year, starting on this year. One more constraint - on each year you are allowed to sell only either the leftmost or the rightmost wine on the shelf and you are not allowed to reorder the wines on the shelf (i.e. they must stay in the same order as they are in the beginning).You want to find out, what is the maximum profit you can get, if you sell the wines in optimal order.So for example, if the prices of the wines are (in the order as they are placed on the shelf, from left to right):Wrong solutionAfter playing with the problem for a while, you'll probably get the feeling, that in the optimal solution you want to sell the expensive wines as late as possible. You can probably come up with the following greedy strategy:Every year, sell the cheaper of the two (leftmost and rightmost) available wines.Every year, sell the cheaper of the two (leftmost and rightmost) available wines.Although the strategy doesn't mention what to do when the two wines cost the same, this strategy kinda feels right. But unfortunately, it isn't, as the following example demonstrates. If the prices of the wines are:The greedy strategy would sell them in the orderBut we can do better if we sell the wines in the orderThis counter-example should convince you, that the problem is not so easy as it can look on a first sight and I will tell you, that it can be solved using DP.Write a backtrackWhen coming up with the memoization solution for a problem, I always start with a backtrack solution that finds the correct answer. Backtrack solution enumerates all the valid answers for the problem and chooses the best one. For most of the problems it is easy to come up with such solution.Here are some restrictions I put on a backtrack solution:So for the problem with wines, the backtrack solution will look like this:int p[N]; // read-only array of wine pricesWe can get the answer by calling:int answer = profit(1, 0, N-1); // N is the total number of winesThis solution simply tries all the possible valid orders of selling the wines. If there areThe correctly written backtrack function should always represent an answer to a well-stated question. In our caseMinimize the state space of function argumentsIn this step I want you to think about, which of the arguments you pass to the function are redundant. Either we can construct them from the other arguments or we don't need them at all. If there are any such arguments, don't pass them to the function. Just calculate them inside the function.In the above functionint N; // read-only number of wines in the beginningI also want you to think about the range of possible values the function arguments can get from a valid input. In our case, each of the argumentsNow cache itWe are now 99% done. To transform the backtrack function with time complexity O(2^As noted above, there are only O(The answer is - the exponential time complexity comes from the repeated recursion and because of that, it computes the same values again and again. If you run the above code for an arbitrary array ofint N; // read-only number of wines in the beginningAnd that's it! With that little trick it runs O(Note: when the values are cached, you can treat every recursive call inside the function as it would run in O(1) time complexity.SummaryTo sum it up, if you identify that a problem can be solved using DP, try to create a backtrack function that calculates the correct answer. Try to avoid the redundant arguments, minimize the range of possible values of function arguments and also try to optimize the time complexity of one function call (remember, you can treat recursive calls as they would run in O(1) time). Finally cache the values and don't calculate the same things twice.The final time complexity of the solution is:",817 followers,Sumeet Raj Thakker,32.1K,0,0,13.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-reasons-other-than-cost-to-not-replace-RAM-entirely-with-a-cache-of-equal-size-If-cost-is-the-only-reason-we-would-ve-been-able-to-buy-very-expensive-but-super-fast-computers-right

The whole system cost less than $8,000 after all the rebates were considered. Once each year the utility company “zeroes” out my account and credits me for the power they have banked from me but that I have not used. As a result, I think my total electric bill actual payments since I installed the system have been less than $200 total for 6 years. My monthly bill used to be $100-$150. Plus, I switched from propane heat to electric and from a gas water heater to electric, and where I used to burn $500 - $1000 propane each winter, now it is basically zero.So I would say that if you design the system correctly, solar panels are 100% effective in reducing power bills.At another property, the local utility charges a “demand” charge for use during peak hours of 3pm-8pm. Now 3pm-5pm in the summer is the hottest part of the day. So I installed a small number of panels to keep the demand charge low and so I can still cool the house cheaply during those times. A modest investment in panels (3000 watts) lets me run my AC and keep the demand charge low. The demand charge is around $20 per KWH during peak times, so my 3kw panel setup saves maybe $50 a month, plus another $0.12/kwH for an average savings of $60 or so a month, so maybe $100-$120 off the bill for a 3KW setup which cost about $5,000 after rebates (and doing the work myself), and so they will pay for themselves in 50 months or a little over 4 years.

And we’ve had electronic networks that do much the same for other sorts of digital transactions for decades.But it’s Bitcoin’s decentralized structure that drives its huge carbon emissions footprint. That’s because to verify transactions, Bitcoin requires computers to solve ever more complex math problems. This is the basic concept that the cryptocurrency world refers to as a “proof-of-work” system, and it’s drastically more energy intensive than verifying transactions on centralized networks.“In the case of Bitcoin, this is done by having many different competitors all conduct a race to see how quickly they can package the transactions and solve a small mathematical problem,” says Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at EY. The fastest computer not only certifies the transaction, but it also gets a small reward for its trouble in the form of a Bitcoin payment.In Bitcoin’s early days, this process didn’t consume nation-state amounts of electricity. But it’s inherent to the cryptocurrency’s technology for the math puzzles to become much, much harder as more people compete to solve them—and this dynamic will only accelerate as more people attempt to buy into Bitcoin.To combat this, more and more specialized computers, called rigs, are entering the fray, pouring huge amounts of computational and electrical energy into the ecosystem in the race to be the first to solve Bitcoin math puzzles and get the associated prize. That means even though there may be hundreds of thousands of computers racing to solve the same problem, only one can ultimately receive the Bitcoin honorarium.“Of course, this is wasteful in the sense that 99.99% of all the machines that did work just throw away the result since they didn’t win the race,” says Brody. While this process produces a fair and secure result, it also creates a ton of carbon emissions. “I very much doubt [whoever founded] Bitcoin anticipated such enormous success in the future and, consequently, the enormous amounts of power we’re talking about,” says Brody.This process also takes an immense amount of time: Upwards of 10 minutes per Bitcoin transaction. Other digital transactions, like those powered by Visa, take less than a second and use roughly 1/500,000 the energy because they rely on a centralized authority to verify transactions.What Can Be Done?Solving Bitcoin’s near-continent-sized energy consumption problem doesn’t require returning to centralized systems, like Visa’s network—after all, the central promise of Bitcoin is the elimination of middlemen like the card networks and their concentrated power over finance. Instead, Bitcoin’s advocates have more than a few options.Switch to Renewable EnergyCurrently, an estimated 39% of proof-of-work mining is performed using renewable energy. So perhaps the most obvious path to a green future for Bitcoin is simply upping that figure.Countless startups have emerged to address this gap, each targeting new ways to bring more environmentally friendly energy to Bitcoin. Take Hong Kong-based LiquidStack, which aims to more efficiently lower the temperature of mining rigs, or Genesis Mining in Iceland, which exclusively uses renewable energy sources.These solutions, however, fail to address that even if all energy pumping into the Bitcoin industrial complex were green, at large scale its proof-of-work verification technology is inherently wasteful.Transition to Proof-of-Stake SystemsCryptocurrencies could move from proof-of-work systems to “proof-of-stake” systems that don’t require this same mad dash to solve complex puzzles, says eToro cryptocurrency market analyst Simon Peters.Put simply, proof-of-stake requires miners to front a small amount of cryptocurrency to be entered into a lottery for the chance to verify transactions. The thought is that if you’re putting up some amount of value as collateral, you’re less likely to approve fraudulent transactions that would devalue the currency and cost you your stake.Because proof-of-stake systems remove the competitive computational element of proof-of-work, “it saves energy and allows each machine in a PoS to work on one problem at a time, as opposed to a PoW system, in which an array of machines are rushing to solve the same problem (thus wasting energy),” says Peters.Ethereum the blockchain system powering Ether and most NFTs, already has plans to transition to a proof-of-stake system. This will dramatically reduce the energy consumption of Ethereum-based cryptos and blockchains by an estimated 99.5%.Embrace Pre-MiningTo avoid the wasteful computing involved in solving math problems quickly to earn digital coins, some cryptos have introduced pre-mining, a system that functionally works much like fiat currency or stocks. A central authority, like the U.S. government (in the case of dollars) or a company (in the case of stocks), creates a set amount of an item and then carefully releases it into the economy depending on what’s going on in the world or their business.Pre-mined cryptos work the same way.“Several other cryptoassets like XRP [also popularly referred to as Ripple] weren’t mined at all but were instead produced algorithmically,” says Peters. “This eliminates the need for dedicated high-speed mining equipment.”In these systems, transactions are still verified by a decentralized network of validators before they’re added to the currency’s blockchain record, but those involved in the transaction may have to pay a small transaction fee to compensate the validators for their effort since the currency system itself doesn’t always reward them. In the case of XRP, this fee is a fraction of a cent currently.Transitioning Bitcoin to a proof-of-stake or pre-mined system wouldn’t be easy: To fundamentally alter the Bitcoin protocol someone would have to convince the majority of miners to agree to the new system, a tough ask when billions are at stake and the existing system works, if slowly and electrically inefficiently. The last time a change of this magnitude happened, it was not accepted universally by miners, resulting in a so-called “hard fork” that created a separate cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash, which itself later hard forked into Bitcoin SV, among others.Introduce Carbon Credits or FeesCarbon credits represent the government-sanctioned ability for a company to emit a certain amount of carbon emission into the environment. They’re often securitized, meaning they can be traded to by companies that don’t need to produce a lot of emissions to other companies that do. This incentivizes a company to produce less than its allotment—as well as penalizes those that go over. In the case of a crypto mining company, this might mean it purchases carbon credits from another company to help offset the amount of emissions it creates or switches to greener energy so it can earn a profit from selling its credits.“These are a tried-and-true method under a variety of programs like the Clean Air Act to get to net-zero emissions for products.",0 followers,Mark Adler,2.5K,755,2M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-power-your-cryptocurrency-mining-rig-s-with-solar-power-How

Condoms are only worn by about 5 percent of the male population. That’s pretty troubling, considering that when condoms are used correctly, they’re about 98 percent effective in preventing STDs. Developing countries are especially at risk, because an HIV diagnosis in those parts of the world remains a death sentence due to the high cost of antiretrovirals.So the following designers called upon couples to instigate as much bedroom research as they were able to for each design. Here are a few of the candidates:The yellow latex “Origami Internal Condom” created by ORIGAMI Condoms founder Danny Resnic. It’s designed to work alongside the mechanics of sex as an “active condom.” It moves alongside the body’s motion and actually creates a sensation on the inside of the condom.A hydrogel condom developed by a team from the University of Wollongong in Australia. Hydrogel as a material is purported to be a more durable latex alternative, and is engineered to feel and perform like real skin.Aravind Vijayaraghavan and a team from the University of Manchester plan to use nanomaterials to heighten sensation. It's made of elastomeric composite materials, to be specific – which should be able to increase natural sensations.A one-size-fits-all condom made from a composite material, developed by Benjamin Strutt and a team from Cambridge Design Partnership. The material is engineered to tighten ever so slightly during intercourse, which should both enhance sensation and increase reliability.A condom made from collagen (the main component in connective tissue) designed by Mark McGlothlin of Apex Medical Technologies Inc. Using collagen allows a hydrated skin-like exterior that permits transfer of heat to facilitate a more natural sensation.Mass-produced blood in a lab!

Military planes will soon be pilot-less.There's a lot of advantages to it, as advances in electronic sensors, communications technology, and guided weapons  have fundamentally transformed the nature of air combat.At the beginning, pilots relied on the human eye as the primary air-to-air sensor and machine guns and automatic canon as their primary weapons.  But the human eye can only spot an aircraft-sized target up to about 2 nautical miles in range, and aircraft cannon are only effective to less a nautical mile.The introduction of air-to-air radars and missiles transformed air combat beginning in the 1960s.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, short-range air-to-air missiles began to overtake guns as the dominate means for air-to-air kills, not just for the U.S. military but for foreign air forces as well.  During in the 1980s and 1990s, missiles that could operate beyond visual range overtook short-range missiles as the primary means for shooting down opposing aircraft.  This meant that the success of fighter pilots was no longer “linked to what they can physically see through the cockpit canopy, but what they glean from cockpit displays.”In other words, the days of Maverick and Goose in Top Gun having to maneuver behind an enemy MiG are long gone.  Air-to-air combat today is more like playing a video game, and engagements occur at distances so great that neither pilot ever sees the other.  Whereas speed, acceleration, and maneuverability were important in the gun and short-range missile eras, stealth, sensors, long-range weapons, and endurance are increasingly important in the beyond-visual-range era.  This raises the question: What is the advantage of having a person sitting in the cockpit looking at computer displays when that person could be sitting on the ground looking at the same information?Remotely piloted aircraft can match or exceed manned aircraft in many of the performance attributes of increasing importance for modern fighter jets, particularly when it comes to endurance.  Manned fighters are limited in how long they can stay in the air not by fuel (since they can be refueled in the air) but by how long the pilot can stay strapped into an ejection seat.  Unlike cargo planes and bombers, where the flight crew can get up, go to the bathroom, and even swap crew members mid-flight, fighter pilots can barely even stretch their legs in their tiny cockpits.  Remotely piloted aircraft, on the other hand, are not limited by the endurance of the pilot because they change out crew members as often as necessary.  And since remotely piloted aircraft can be refueled in the air, unmanned aircraft can stay in the air (and in the fight) until they run out of lubricants or need maintenance.Another reason the Navy’s next fighter jet is likely to be unmanned is that remotely piloted aircraft cost less over the long run.  To be clear, the aircraft themselves do not necessarily cost less, and in some cases they may actually cost more per plane to build and more per flying hour to operate than the equivalent manned aircraft.  The savings come from not having to fly them as often for training missions.  Fighter pilots need to be in the air to stay at peak readiness because flying a fighter jet, as Stillion has noted in another report, is like “simultaneously playing the piccolo, driving a formula-one race car, and bench pressing 200 pounds.”  Remotely piloted aircraft, in contrast, don’t need to be in the air to maintain pilot skills–simulator training is a realistic substitute for actual operations.There is more to the cost factor.

However, its use case and widespread adoption will take a considerable amount of time due to the cost of production, implementation, and the growth of the ecosystem as a whole.But to be honest, for most consumers, what we have today is already adequate in an objective sense - the multitasking ability of our computers today provides a seamless experience for us as it is.

This calculation involved checking whether the output of an algorithm for generating random numbers was truly random.The researchers were able to use a quantum computer to perform this complex mathematical calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds, according to the paper.

The detail in a world is also not just black and white, but often things like “how hot is the temperature of each parcel of air, water”. The numbers being expressed often fall within a very wide range, from very small (i.e. 0.000000001 to very large, i.e. trillions). A floating point format lets us represent these numbers with reasonable precision for the calculations. These numbers can be organised into matrices, then computations, often vector computations, made between these matrices. Since the number of these computations required is so vast, it is worth asking how fast a computer can chug through this, thus the floating point operations per second (FLOPs) is a key metric.There are certainly other computations that can be done that are not made using floating point data, such as with strings of text, or other data that can be digitised as integers within a reasonable range (i.e. 32-bit integer, between 0 and 4 billion). For example, if you built a super-computer to search for all the instant messages ever written in the world in real time, all of which are text data, it would want to have a high performance in such integer operations. It just happens that more super-computers are involved in those types of computation where floating point. Plus, as another has answered, floating point operations are inherently harder to do fast.

When they had decided majority and minority should be living together, they should have also made efforts to develop unity. However, they did something opposite. Instead of making one law for all, they made different laws for the minority. As a result, the difference grew over time.Mistake 4:British government was strict on Indians.

India had been looted, subject to a rule of violence, racism and economic exploitation rarely seen in history. It would be reduced from the world’s largest economy, largest exporter of manufactured goods and agricultural foodstuffs to a nation unable to feed itself and divided. In 1947, India was a nation at war, with millions of refugees coming in both the Western and Eastern sectors of the nation. There were three weeks of foreign currency reserves and Churchill's policy led Bengal Famine had not just technically ended. Soon India would run out of essential medicines, and they were no national resources, or currency to pay for them with. India’s ability to even make basic medicine had been all but destroyed in the 190 years of colonialism. Refined gasoline would go into shortage as the war effort in Kashmir continued. Major industries ceased to function as supply lines from East Bengal and West Punjab stopped. Yet, in this epic disaster Indian National Railways never stopped running, nor the will of India’s people to survive. Rich and poor, refugee and local all worked as one at this time for everyone knew this was the first time the dawn of freedom had come to rise, after 190 years of slavery,loss of Indian dignity, pride and hope for the masses of India.Bengal Famine 1943.1947 Partition of IndiaPrime Minister Nehru, would stand at his most difficult hour at this time. He would at his advanced age after doing nearly 9 years in colonial prison the longest just ending in the years before partition, he would visit refugees, encourage them, and it would become clear he had no resources to back his words other than his intentions. Mahatma Gandhi would be lost in 1948, and India would largely be held together because of the dynamic and tireless work Sardar Patel, who with a heart condition managed to unite India against all odds. Prime Minister Nehru never listened to Sardar Patel enough in his lifetime, I have heard this so many times in my life from people who knew him. As the 1950s dawned India embarked on a massive campaign of building heavy industry, Schools, Universities and Hospitals. Yet, India could not produce enough food to feed it’s population. It was predicted that India would collapse in the 1970s because of a population which would grow to over 600 million by then. Malnutrition affected the population, and basic health requirements could not be met. India would ask for food assistance and be denied it by both the U.S. and the U.K. in 1951. Famine was only averted that year, because of emergency food assistance by the U.S.S.R. on orders from Stalin.Nehru would approach the issue of agriculture by ending Zamindari (Large Land Holdings) in the 1950s. Soon there were small independent farmers who were landowners. Mechanization though being introduced was not affordable for farmers. Crop yields would remain low, and the skill set of farmers would not greatly increase. As time went on the constant need to import grain, would steadily eat at Indian growth rates as capital was used to import food. By the 1960s though food production had increased, it still was not sufficient to end grain imports. A new Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi would be forced to devalue to Rupee in order to get food assistance from the U.S. In personal recollections she would reveal how demeaning the experiences were as India was lectured on what policies to embrace in order to get food assistance.India’s strategic food reserve is one the largest in the world.India’s victory in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War would prelude a decade of success for India that it had not seen in a millennium. In 1974, India would detonate an atomic device successfully, and in the late 1970s, India would become a food sufficient nation. By the early 1980s, India had the ability to export food products for the first time since 1757. The age of India having a “Begging Bowl” in her hands was over. In her epic landslide election in 1980 Prime Smt. Indira Gandhi would campaign in an India which was an Atomic Power, a food exporter and manufacturer of industrial products. India was a nation which had the world’s 4th most powerful military. All this had happened in 33 years from the end of colonialism. Since 1947, India never again has had a famine, since the early 2000s it maintains one of the world’s largest food reserves in the world.

With compilers that could optimize for vector processing, supercomputers could do in minutes what might take conventional computers weeks.As microprocessors evolved, they added their own sort of vector instructions, and other means to get fast performance. The Nintendo 64 came 21 years later than the Cray 2, with more performance on 3D graphics than a Cray could achieve. Before long, there was little point in building custom supercomputer CPU architectures that competed with commodity microprocessors. But the whole point of a supercomputer isn't any specific thing, like vector processing, it's about being crazy fast. So the modern supercomputer is built from an large matrix of commodity microprocessors and, more recently, GPUs. The Cray Titan, for example, is built from 18,688 AMD Operton CPUs paired with an equal number of nVidia Tesla GPUs to perform at a theoretical peak of 27 petaFLOPS (AMD's Opteron architecture, based around HyperTransport links, made it easy to build different connection architectures in such machines).Now, if you have 18,688 desktop PCs in your house, you'd think you could compete, but you couldn't. The big trick in building massively parallel computers like these is how to actually get some use out of as many of those processors as possible. If you're not careful, the time spent communicating between CPU and CPU or CPU and GPU can wind up taking more system time than the actual problems you're trying to solve. So the specifics of the connection fabric and how the software helps to parallelize an application bring as much to the table as all those processors.So, back to my original assertion: finishing on time. Supercomputers are used, quite often, on really complex jobs that are time sensitive. Weather forcasting, for example, is all based on a few different weather models that run faster-than-realtime in order to deliver a prediction while it'll still do some good. There are always better models that don't run in realtime, which are always run after-the-fact in the case that most of the working models fail on a critical prediction. Simulation of protein folding, modeling and eventually predicting earthquakes, modeling brains, rendering for a film (probably more likely done on a larger ""server farm"" these days), etc. those are ultra complex to run, and all with practical deadlines.",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,3.3K,12.9K,66.9M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/Will-quantum-computing-replace-the-cloud-in-the-future

This is why NOAA, GM, Ford, Toyota, and Honda have their own supercomputers, that are configured to run their specialized workloads.","9,922 followers",Brett Bergan,1.3K,7K,82.9M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/What-can-a-supercomputer-do-that-a-normal-computer-cant

So, obviously, I worked on nothing more than standard desktop PCs.But from what I saw around the Goddard Space Flight Center [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_Space_Flight_Center ], I saw nothing special.Okay, I now confess that isn’t much of an answer, but I’ve got more.THINK LOGICALLYScientifically and logically, it’s not possible for NASA to be using computers 30–40 years ahead of what the public uses.I’ll illustrate.First, think of my experience at NASA working on standard desktops at the time. I also helped set up PCs at NASA at that time and we were dealing with hard drives of hundreds of megabytes. Now, 25 years later, it would take several of them to store just a single movie and they cost hundreds of dollars each back then. So, let’s say four $500 hard drives to store one movie, in 1995 dollars.In today’s dollars that would be $3,700 in disk storage costs for one movie.My iPhone has 512GB of memory. I had a choice to get 256GB, but it cost me only $100 to buy another 256BG—so I did because I’m an old guy and it blows me away how much memory I can get for so cheap.How cheap?If I paid the same for memory today that I paid in 1995—see the pricing above—the 512GB in my iPhone would cost $947,200.LET’S UNWIND THE CLOCK NOWAnd it would take up the space that would fill the back of a typical minivan—based on 800 old PC hard drives, which were about 70 cubic inches each in size.And that is going back only 25 years.The IBM PC hasn’t even turned 40 yet and if I ran the same comparison with the costs and capacity of the 1981 IBM machine that I ran above on a 1995 PC, it would be similarly ridiculous—because, trust that in 1995 we were all blown away by the massive storage we were buying and how unbelievably cheap it had become.To be clear, in 1995 the amount of computer storage that costs $100 today—and is about the size of a postage stamp—cost about a million dollars and we were stunned by how cheap that was.So, there is no way anyone is ever going to have a computer that is 30 years ahead of what the public is using.Because in about 30 years, whatever they have today will fit in your shirt pocket.ADDENDU...","29,784 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,974,7.6K,248.8M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/What-can-a-supercomputer-do-that-a-normal-computer-cant

Pick a 3 or 4 letter acronym and we had similar equipment there too. It was the same in those facilities.So hardware wise, 30–40 years is way out there. 5 to 15 years is reasonable. Having made the move from hardware to software in the late 1990s, I’m comfortable saying the software was also that far ahead of the public. After all, you had to have the programming to operate the new functionality on those mainframes.The equipment our company front ended was primarily the Sperry Univac 1100 series mainframes. Our cache disk subsystems were among the first on Earth.As a side note, the first few times sitting in Mission Control during Shuttle launches were extraordinary. After that, it was no different than any other job and kind of boring. Sitting there for 20+ hours doing nothing was pretty boring.Along the back wall of Mission Control there was this glassed-in room full of different desktops and modems. A couple of these were Apple II Cs. Once I popped into that little room. I’d never played with Apples, so I sat down to figure them out.I pulled up a few of the programs on there to see what they did. I finally pulled one up that was almost like a messaging system on FidoNet. I typed in a message figuring it would be sent out at during the nightly FidoNet batch.Imagine my surprise when I got an immediate reply to my message. Before I new it there were three or four of us chatting on this system, each person from a different facility around the country.

It has been assumed that if AGI theory were published then everyone would want to build a prototype. The US could easily have two projects, probably two in Europe, one in Japan, and one in China. I think China could eventually get one working but it might take years longer than the US or European efforts.","284,817 followers",James Altucher,989,878,91.6M,4.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-need-a-64bit-processor-Would-it-be-possible-to-combine-two-32bit-CPUs

You have web administrators for that kind of stuff. Sure, we’re advanced computer users, but that’s like telling a truck driver, “Hey, you work in a field with cars, don’t you know how to fix my transmission?” And the answer is… only if this proved relevant in their life until now.

The combination of the temtum Consensus Algorithm and Temporal technology allows the temtum network to deliver extremely high transaction throughput and short transaction confirmation times with low resource requirements.They have used laboratory tests followed by a live deployment over globally distributed servers to confirm a throughput of up to 120,000 transactions per second (a multiple of the peak capacity of 56,000 TPS on the VISA network).[2]The technology behind temtum is already fully developed, including mobile and web applications, (which are described below). It is already a fully operational form of payment and has already secured Govt contracts. Temtum is also being developed by one of the strongest teams in the Blockchain industry. Here is some more info;- Developed by Dragon Infosec:- Has a live mainnet :https://explorer.temtum.com/- PhD / peer reviewed tech- Contracts with Anguilla and Zimbwawe for their currency - lots of others coming- Private funded - no ICO / IEO - never asked anyone for cash - its all their own- Totally feelessThe NIST Randomness Beacon is novel to temtum, and is a source of truly random numbers that broadcasts full-entropy bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds, providing three key functions: unpredictability, autonomy and consistency. The unpredictable nature of the NIST Randomness Beacon makes it impossible for any user to predict the bits it generates before they are published by the source. All users accessing the source of the beacon can be confident that they all receive an identical random string, while the beacon remains highly resistant to malicious interference by external parties. The key features of the NIST Randomness Beacon include:- Generated numbers that cannot be predicted before they are published–even by future quantum computing techniques.- The public,time-bound and authenticated nature ofthe NIST Randomness Beacon allows any user application to prove that it used truly random numbers not known before a specific point in time.- Proof of random number generation can be validated offline at any point subsequent to generation. Based on these properties,the NIST beacon has been chosen as a source of randomness for the Temporal network.",639 followers,Said Nusir,572,0,0,13.0,https://www.quora.com/Did-Elon-Musk-start-a-cryptocurrency

It looks too good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don’t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform.

Thank me Later.PS: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing so that you could gain one or two things as this has been working for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.1It Will Be the Main Currency in the FutureOne thing that the economic crisis of 2008 showed us is that traditional banking systems are flawed. And it’s been confirmed in 2020. More and more people are seeing the need for viable alternatives. And that’s exactly what crypto offers — a secure, decentralized form of banking, that takes governments and banks out of the equation.And the crazy thing is, that even banks realize it. Just listen to what Germany’s Deutsche Bank have to say. In their ‘Imagine 2030’ report, they talk about how fragile the traditional money system is — that by 2030, over 200 million people will be using digital money — and by then, traditional money will already be on the way out.And it’s not just Deutsche Bank. Twitter’s Jack Dorsey has said he believes Bitcoin will eventually become the world’s single currency. Elon Musk has stated that ‘crypto is a far better way to transfer value than a piece of paper.’ China State TV has called Blockchain — the technology that makes crypto possible — 10 times more valuable than the internet.2You Need to Get Familiarized With the TechnologyIt’s the biggest technological invention since the internet. So, if you ‘re still not up to speed with it, you’re behind. But the good news is, you’re still in time to start playing catch-up.Just like in the 90s, when the internet was taking off, there were those who resisted adapting to it. There will be those people with the blockchain and crypto revolution — but do you really want to be one of them?And just like we now rely on the internet for information and communications — soon it’s going to be the same for financial transactions using blockchain. So if you’re not familiar with using it yet now’s the time — what are you waiting for?3You will position yourself better for opportunities in this spaceSure, you can make and receive payments with a crypto account. You can use it to save. But the really big opportunities come with investing in crypto.Just take a look at Bitcoin. If you’d invested $100 in it just 5 years ago, by now that $100 would be worth $2 500. Or if you’d got in really early with that $100 ten years ago, be worth $1.9 million.The price of Bitcoin is still set to keep on going up. Sure, with blips here and there. And to be fair, probably not as dramatically as it did before. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple and Lisk also have huge potential to grow, and bring great returns to savvy investors.But to know which coins to invest in, and when you do need to get educated — and get some experience under your belt. So why waste any time? Now’s the time to get crypto-savvy and learn to spot the opportunities — because you can be sure, there are huge opportunities waiting.4It’s a Solid Alternative for Saving Your MoneyWe’ve already talked about crypto’s long-term upwards trend. Let’s compare that with regular money. If you took $100 in cash, buried it, and waited 10 years, the amount you could buy with it a decade later could be a lot less than when you put it in the ground. Because of inflation. And leaving it in a bank account isn’t going to be much better — if at all. Because of the interest rates in bank accounts, which vary from zero to extremely low.Disclaimer — yes, crypto is more volatile than most currencies, largely because it’s still new, and gaining traction. Like at the start of 2018 when the price of Bitcoin tanked. Remember, it’s more or less recovered since then. And it’s upward trend is likely to continue, and win out on any volatility. And that’s what makes it such a great option for long-term saving — something that will beat any interest rated banks can give you.5You Are Safe From InflationSo, we were just talking about inflation. Let’s spell that out in full. The problem with traditional money is that it’s always going down in value. And this isn’t by accident. Governments and central banks do it on purpose. Especially when there’s a financial crisis. Like the one in 2008, or the one this year, in 2020.At times like these, there’s a shortage of money. And governments try to get around it by just printing more. In fact, 22% of all dollars that exist today were created in 2020, when the Federal Reserve injected $2 trillion into the economy.Making money appear out of thin air, might sound pretty neat. Until you figure out the catch. There may be more money — but the amount of goods and services it’s chasing stays the same. And the value of money goes down compared with the value of those goods and services. And that’s what we call inflation.That’s why smart people trust gold more than money. Because when there’s an economic crisis, new gold doesn’t just magically appear out of nowhere. And it holds its value. And Bitcoin and other crypto — just like gold — don’t get created as a short-term fix to financial problems. That means it crypto also holds its value. And it’s inflation-proof.6It’s Way Easier to Get Into Crypto Than You ThoughtJust in case you thought you need a PhD in programming, or maybe in finance to get into crypto — we’ll tell you now. You don’t. A smartphone with internet access will do nicely. In fact, crypto is way easier to get into than more traditional investments.First, because it’s got high liquidity — that you can buy and sell it easily and quickly. Second, there isn’t a high threshold to getting into it. For stocks and bonds, usually you need to put a large sum of money, and you can’t just put down 100 bucks. With crypto, you can.Better still, there are no institutions, no paperwork — just get an account, get a wallet, track your assets. And it’s pseudonymous — you don’t have to give any documents, or even your name.But we realize, there’s still a lot of confusion, and not many people understand how this space works, and how to take advantage of it. That’s why we decided to create the best course out there, to guide you step by step through everything we’ve learned about Bitcoin and Blockchain — from scratch.It’s called Bitcoin Essentials. You’ll learn how the technology works, how to use it, how to buy bitcoin safely, and how to store it. Just to go7No One Controls Your MoneySo if regular money is controlled by governments and banks — who does control crypto? Well, the beauty of crypto is that it’s controlled by nobody — and everybody — at the same time.Let’s take Bitcoin. The code is stored in thousands of nodes — that means the computers of tens of thousands people who voluntarily run Bitcoin software on their computers. There’s no central authority or mastermind behind it. All users effectively retain control. And it’s in everyone’s interests to keep the network active and healthy.And running it this way has all kinds of advantages over banks. Like, banks are only open business hours of the country they’re based in. Blockchain functions non-stop. And banks payments can take up to 48 hours to clear — Bitcoin transactions take between 15 minutes and an hour.8The Best Security on the MarketSo, if there’s no big powerful institution monitoring it, is it safe? The answer is a definite yes. It’s got the best security out there. And that’s down to the way information is stored.Any time a transaction takes place, and digital money gets handed over to a new user, that gets recorded permanently. And it can’t be erased. Even after it’s changed hands again. And remember we said that the data is stored by tens of thousands users? Unlike a bank, which has one central database.If one user has an error — or if anyone tries to tamper with information — the other tens of thousands will cross-reference each other and correct it. And the bigger the network — the more secure. And in the case of Bitcoin — that’s big. And you can count on it being secure.9The Lowest Fees by FarFor any kind of investment you make, there are going to be fees. Fees for making buying, selling and even storing the investment. And this is also true of crypto. But the difference is that with crypto, fees that are determined by users. And that means it’s in their interest to keep them low. Much lower than the ones you’ll be charged by stockbrokers to invest in stocks or bonds.And the same goes for making transfers — especially international ones. Make a transfer through a bank, and you’re going to get slapped by a high fee. But with crypto, there are no institutions making a profit from these money transfers, which is a huge advantage for people doing business. And another reason why the adoption rate of crypto is going to keep going up.10Blockchain Is Here to StayWhat you have to understand about blockchain, is that Bitcoin and other crypto, are built on Blockchain in the same way Facebook or Google are built on top of the internet. It’s what makes crypto possible — but there’s more to blockchain than crypto.We think that crypto is proof enough that blockchain is going to become more important. But just in case you needed more — let’s just look at all the other things blockchain is being used for.Big business is using it to record data. Companies like Pfizer, Walmart, Siemens, Unilever use it to keep data which is too complex for a spreadsheet to record. Healthcare providers use it to store their patients’ medical records safely. And there’s potential for it to grow in records of property ownership. And in elections, to keep track of votes and take away the need for recounts. Yep, that one would have come in handy in 2020.11High Returns if Done RightWe’ve already told you how much Bitcoin’s gone up — and how the long-term trend is bound to continue upwards. So we won’t repeat ourselves. But we will take the chance to tell you about a few other cryptocurrencies.In 2020, even with the pandemic in full swing, lots of crypto have seen big gains. The world’s second largest crypto, Ethereum started the year at $145, and is now at $600. And some are tipping it to become as popular as Bitcoin.And Ripple started the year at just over 20 cents and is now around 65 cents. And may others are headed in the same direction. Further proof, that now’s the time to get in the door, if you haven’t already.12It’s in Limited Supply — and Can’t Suffer From InflationRemember we talked about the way conventional currencies lose their value because of inflation? There’s a simple reason why crypto doesn’t.The supply is capped. This is written into the source code, which states that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin produced.Currently, 18.5 million Bitcoins have been mined. Quick explanation — mining means when advanced computers crack complex math problems and unlock the Bitcoins stored in the code.And even if new Bitcoins are still getting mined, there’s a limit on this. Unlike with traditional money, when banks decide print it by the truckload. With Bitcoin, the number of new coins released slows down every four years, meaning the supply is limited. And that’s the reason Bitcoin won’t suffer from inflation.13The Price Is Dictated by the Free Market, No Government Can Touch ItWith traditional money, governments have lots of options for manipulating its value. We already mentioned printing new money. As well as that, they set interest rates — the price of borrowing government money, which has ripple effect on the rest of the economy.But with crypto, none of this is set by a government. Instead everything’s controlled by the free market — or how much people are willing to buy or sell it for. And besides that, governments can’t freeze crypto accounts, or look at records of who has how much in crypto accounts. That’s because, unlike regular bank accounts, crypto accounts are pseudonymous. That means the holder doesn’t disclose their true name or identity.14It’s at an Early Stage and Already Disrupting MarketsSince Bitcoin was created in 2009, meaning that crypto’s already over 10 years old. But now’s the time it’s’ really taking off — and the growth it’s’ going to see over the next decades is likely to be a whole load more exciting than what we’ve seen up until now. You could say, the stage we’re at now is like the internet in the 90s.In fact, if you look at the numbers of people who’ve adopted cryptocurrencies over the last decade, it looks a lot like the adoption of the internet back in the 90s. Deutsche Bank have pointed out this similarity — and they predict that adoption rates are going to keep on at the same rate as the internet after the 90s. In other words, it’s going to keep on going up — in a spectacular way.And just like the internet’s disrupted literally everything over the last twenty years — we’re probably looking at blockchain doing the same over the coming decades.15Big Business Is Taking It SeriouslyLook at the list of companies that already accept payment in Bitcoin. Microsoft. AT&T. McDonalds, KFC and Subway. Virgin Galactic. CheapAir. Gyft. 4Chan. Norwegian Air. Twitch. Sports clubs like the Dallas Mavericks, Miami Dolphins or Portuguese soccer club Benfica. And Wikipedia accepts donations in Bitcoin.True, other companies are still reluctant to allow payments in it — because, it’s still volatile. But that’s bound to even out over time, and more and more big business will accept Bitcoin — and other crypto — as payment.And remember how we mentioned that Twitter’s Jack Dorsey’s talked about it being the future of money? Well, he’s put his money where his mouth is, and his payments company Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin.","1,716 followers",Wilfred Edmund,926,65,879.6K,18.0,https://www.quora.com/Did-Elon-Musk-start-a-cryptocurrency

Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 years, and 2016 will be no different.While only a third of the solar energy available in the US is currently harnessed in the west, this area is geographically superior for solar power generation, and improved government incentives in California indicate this will be the fastest-growing market.3. 3D PrintingThe new millennium has brought us some mind-blowing technology, but none has more potential for impacting the entire world quite like 3D printing.If you’re not familiar with the concept, 3D printers are loaded with additives which can be used like ink to create 3-dimensional objects. That’s4. Legal MarijuanaLegal marijuana sales have grown exponentially since 2012, when Colorado legalized the drug and created the world’s first fully regulated market for recreational marijuana use. In addition to selling the raw plant, it is also being sold as concentrates, edibles, and even beauty products in order to expand the market.Marijuana sales are expected to surpass $20 billion between now and 2020, and that’s if the market stays its course. If other states legalize recreational marijuana use in that time, the industry could experience even greater success.5. Video GamesOver the years, video game developers have been expanding their appeal to reach new markets, including adults and females. This effort has been paid back many times, as the video game industry commands healthy growth year after year. Consumer confidence continues to improve, and there is speculative excitement regarding new virtual reality (VR) technology.While VR will certainly have an effect on the gaming industry, it also has potential in other markets. Whether or not other industries will adopt VR for practical purposes, such as training medical professionals, remains to be seen.6. Artificial IntelligenceFor having come so far, artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. With hopes that AI will one day be able to help solve humanity’s most pressing concerns, billions of dollars fund the research of artificial intelligence every year. Major players include IT companies like Google and Apple, who are already leaders in the field, providing us with such AI amenities as voice-recognition software and self-driving cars.Experts expect the global demand for “smart” machines will increase 20% every year until at least 2020.7. Sustainable Construction MaterialsIn the wake of an international recession, many countries, including the United States, are creating an initiative to boost construction jobs. There are plenty of post-industrial sites around the developed world which need to be rebuilt, and much like the call for sustainable energy sources, governments and consumers alike are calling for greener building materials.Green construction is currently a $36-billion industry, and it is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2020.This industry depends heavily on consumer demand, and may have an even greater outlook with increased government regulations and successful marketing.8. Cyber Fraud DetectionWhere there’s an opportunity to make a quick buck, be sure that there are criminals out there concocting a plan. The trend of doing business and keeping sensitive information on computers will increase, and so will the demand for protection against cyber criminals.Businesses and individuals alike will require protection from cyber fraud for the foreseeable future, but in the next 5 years, this industry is expected to grow over 12% annually.9. DronesDrone technology is new, but the potential for application in a variety of other industries including agriculture, the military, and parcel delivery have already caught the attention of investors. This creates an excellent opportunity in the market to expand research and development of drones, making them more viable with each in iteration. With a projected annual growth of almost 17% annually until 2022, very little is likely to stifle the growth of this industry.10. SiliconRelated to the demand for solar panels, silicon has also been a slowly but steadily growing market in the past decades. In addition to solar panels, silicon is also required to make electronics and building materials, which you may notice are also on this list. For this reason, experts expect to see silicon’s demand increase in the coming years as other industries take hold.These 10 industries show tremendous potential in 2016 and beyond, indicating a future of environmental consciousness and an even greater focus on electronics and AI.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,155.4M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-industries-in-the-next-20-years

And if we have learned anything from recent years, then it is that companies that do not participate in these developments will have difficulty surviving. It is important to collect as much information as possible about the technology that most efficiently speeds up the digital transformation of your company. For that, you need to analyze in particular those technologies that can offer you the greatest competitive advantage.I have investigated 25 of the most disruptive trends for 2019 and have listed them for you.Trend 1: The immense potential of Blockchain is becoming increasingly clearAlthough it is primarily known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies, the potential of Blockchain is many times greater. Blockchain is essentially a decentralized ledger with unchangeable transactions. It stores data - spread across thousands of computers - without involving third-party validation. All kinds of sectors, such as the financial industry, the real estate sector, healthcare, and the retail trade, can benefit from Blockchain. For example, you can use it to create a cheaper payment system for international money transfers. Experiments are also being carried out in India With a Blockchain-driven land registry system, in which one can record the sale of land using smart contracts. The government in Dubai plans to run various public services on this decentralized ledger technology. Companies can also use Blockchain to raise money with the help of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This is a crypto version of an IPO, in which investors receive crypto coins instead of shares. As you can see, the potential applications of Blockchain are endless. The expected value of this technology by 2030 and as much as $ 3.1 trillion sums.Trend 2: Artificial intelligence will continue to do great things in 2019We are seeing more and more products and services that are driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Many benefits of AI that we benefit from in daily life are made possible by machine learning (ML), a subset of AI. With this tech, you can train machines to constantly learn things, discover patterns in large amounts of data and thereby generate insights and make decisions. All without human intervention. ML is already used in many sectors and the value of this market is expected to rise to $ 8.81 billion in 2022. The applications of ML are very varied and extensive. The self-driving Google car and the online recommendation systems from Amazon and Netflix are great examples of what is possible with machine learning. Artificial intelligence platforms are also expected to have a major impact on big data analysis. They can process data in a very efficient way and generate valuable business intelligence.Trend 3: Virtual reality - so much more than just gaming technologyVirtual reality (VR) technology has undergone tremendous development in recent years. The tech has shifted from the gaming industry to other sectors, where it has found many different applications. There are very few situations where VR cannot add value. For example, companies such as Osso VR and ImmersiveTouch have developed simulations that allow surgeons with VR headsets to practice surgical procedures. By combining VR with haptic feedback technology, physicians can make even the resistance of tissue to feel, making increasingly effective training methods possible. VR is also popular among scientists. For example, the molecular exploration company Nanome has developed a program that allows users to design and manipulate molecular structures. And for those interested in exploring the universe, SpaceVR is developing ""the first virtual reality camera satellite in the world"" that allows people to experience the vastness of space. One of the main reasons why VR has still not become mainstream is the cost of the headsets, despite efforts by companies such as Facebook and HTC to develop cheaper models. Yet VR is a promising technology with immense potential, the scope of which we cannot yet imagine.Trend 4: In the smart workplace of the future, everything and everyone is connectedOur workplaces are becoming smarter spaces where everything and everyone is connected. This development has various reasons, such as the fact that more and more people want to work in an efficient and environmentally-friendly office. An example of how technology can make the workplace more efficient is Honeywell's Vector Space Sense. With this software, you can see where, when and how spaces in a building are used at a certain moment so that you can better manage space and optimize its use. Siemens is developing a Smart Space solution that should improve the workplace in several ways. For example, algorithms calculate which room has the ideal size for a specific meeting. Moreover, they inform the participants about how to get there. The algorithms also ensure that the lighting and temperature automatically adjust to the preferences of the user (s). These and many other benefits are expected to lead to significant energy savings and more productive employees.Trend 5: Edge computing: a solution for processing the growing amounts of dataWhen data from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are sent over long distances to clouds or other data centers, latency often occurs. With edge computing, you can streamline data traffic from IoT devices and process it closer to the source. This is done through a network of micro data centers instead of clouds. These are often no longer sufficient to directly process the data that we generate. Considering that by 2025 more than 75 billion IoT devices will be in use worldwide and we all generate more and more data, you understand why edge computing is becoming increasingly important. This prompted Intel and Alibaba to launch a Joint Edge Computing Platform that integrates Intel software, hardware and AI technologies with Alibaba Cloud IoT products. The expectation that the value of the edge computing market will reach as much as $ 6.72 billion in 2022 indicates that we will have much more to do with this technology in the future.Trend 6: Cyber attacks target new smart devicesCybersecurity is constantly evolving to counter the ever-changing nature of cyber threats. The latest trends in this area relate to the protection of IoT devices, whereby standard security such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are no longer adequate. Network behavior analysis based on deep learning technology is now seen as a possible solution because it can detect suspicious activities faster and prevent them from better. Another option is to introduce virtual private networks that hide the user's IP address. Hardware authentication protocols and data loss prevention technologies are also becoming increasingly popular. Finally, the growing popularity of the cloud means that this sector must also implement more advanced cybersecurity systems. This is possible, for example, through virtualized firewalls and burglary detection. Overall, the number of cyberattacks is expected to continue to increase in 2019. It is therefore important that both companies and individuals tighten their security measures considerably.Trend 7: Digital ethics, machines, and morality - the debate continuesMore and more attention is being paid to moral dilemmas about artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An example is the well-known 'trolley problem' - a rushing train will kill five railroad workers, but you can save them by converting the points, with 'only' one man killed. What are you doing? This will also become an increasingly relevant issue in the future for autonomous vehicles and other machines. Because how does a self-driving car decide on life and death? And who is responsible for the actions of artificially intelligent devices? We will also continue to conduct the debate on privacy and data protection at the macro level. David Cearley, vice president of research firm Gartner, says companies continue should then ask questions such as ""are we compliant?"" and ""are we doing the right things?"" The European Commission is arguing for a legal and ethical framework for the use of AI. As digital technologies increasingly infiltrate our lives, the number of discussions about digital ethics will continue to increase.Trend 8: The race to bring the world's first quantum computer to the market continues unabatedOver the years, computers have changed from slow, large boxes to super-fast, tiny devices. But even though today's computers are more powerful than their predecessors, when it comes to extremely complex problems, their computing power is increasingly falling short. This has led researchers and companies to investigate the potential of quantum computing. Unlike traditional computers that use bits to process information (with the numbers 0 and 1), quantum computers use qubits. These can store much more information and perform more complex calculations at a much higher speed. Although this technology is still in its infancy, believes IBM we have much more to do with getting into the foreseeable future. Earlier this year IBM even introduced a quantum computer consisting of 50 qubits. Google followed with the 72-qubits quantum computer system Bristlecone. For the time being these super-fast computers are only suitable for laboratory work and research. For large-scale, mainstream use, much more work needs to be done. But the race to bring the world's first quantum computer to the market continues unabated.Trend 9: The emergence of fake contentHave you heard that Obama's are getting a divorce and that Hillary Clinton has financial ties to IS? In this era of fake news, this kind of fabricated story is popping up everywhere. Although fake news is as old as humanity itself, exponential developments in modern technology have made it easier and faster to create and distribute. Moreover, the technology that makes fake content possible becomes more powerful every day, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish it from fake. With artificial intelligence, you can easily create realistic content from someone who says or does something - what he or she has never said or done. This type of content, also called ' deep flakes are made to confuse you, undermine the truth and, for example, to extort companies or individuals. A recent example is actress Emma Watson. She became the victim of deep fakes after someone with fake images made a pornographic video of her. Unfortunately, there are no clear solutions to this problem yet. But developing machine learning in such a way that it can recognize fake content is certainly a step in the right direction.Trend 10: Companies do everything to get hold of consumer data and our privacy is increasingly at stakeIn recent years, privacy-related incidents and security breaches have shown us that our personal information is being leaked, shared and misused at an alarming rate. The scandal surrounding Cambridge Analytica, the data company that - without permission - had used the data of millions of Facebook users for the Donald Trump campaign, is just one of many examples. And social media giants continue to offer their customers all kinds of 'legal' ways to analyze our online behavior. For example, insurance companies can search social media accounts to find evidence for their customers' insurance claims. In the future, for example, they may blame someone who places a video of reckless driving with a higher insurance premium. Even content that you as a parent post about your children on social media can be collected and used to create personalized advertisements. Our privacy is increasingly at stake and it looks unlikely that this will change in 2019. Regulations such as GDPR could be the first step in giving consumers back control of their data, but we still have a long way to go.Trend 11: Augmented reality is gaining momentumAugmented reality (AR) is a promising technology that is already being used successfully in various industries. In healthcare, AR tools can improve patient outcomes and make medical staff more efficient. For example, the technology company Proximie is developing AR solutions to improve medical training and the California Institute of Technology has released an AR app to help people with visual impairments identify objects. In the military sector, AR-tech soldiers can help with their preparations for military missions. The US military has already 100,000 Microsoft HoloLens headsets with night vision purchased that generate data about the activities of the soldier. AR is also increasingly used in museums. A group of artists recently used an AR app that allows you to completely transform Jackson Pollock's paintings in the Museum of Modern Arts. Visitors who scan the paintings with the MoMAR Gallery smartphone app can experience these in very special, interactive ways.Trend 12: Drones are becoming indispensable in more and more sectorsDrone technology was originally only used in the army but has also been finding more and more applications in all sorts of other sectors in recent years. Take the Japanese construction company, Komatsu, for example. Earlier this year they bought 1,000 drones from the well-known drone manufacturer DJI, with which they scan construction sites, identify materials and map (potential) construction areas. Another innovation in drone tech is the mapping of land use. DroneDeploy wants this process through the Live Map, make a mobile tool that generates real-time drone cards a lot easier. What makes drones particularly attractive is that they can, for example, reach disaster areas safely and efficiently. There they can help rescue teams in tracing victims and deliver food and medical devices.Trend 13: Automation of last-mile deliveries - even faster deliveryConsumers are getting more and more power. They expect speed and convenience, especially when it comes to the delivery of purchased products. To meet these requirements, companies keep coming up with new ways to make their last-mile delivery more efficient and faster. And there is, of course, no better way to do this than with autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicle start-up Nuro works hard to improve last-mile deliveries. The company does this with the development of self-driving electric vehicles that deliver packages, groceries, and meals. Renault has also recently developed a self-driving vehicle, the EZ-PRO. With this, the car manufacturer wants to solve traffic problems in large cities and reduce pollution. Although some believe that these innovations will make human drivers redundant, the BBC reports that these developments will in the future allow people to spend more time on more valuable work.Trend 14: Can green technology help save our planet?The biggest problems we face today include pollution and climate change. Unfortunately, this problem is mainly caused by our reckless behavior. To help our planet and ensure that we can live more sustainably in the future, many companies are working on innovative green technologies that can reduce carbon dioxide. The Swiss company Climeworks, for example, has developed a system that can collect carbon dioxide (CO2) from the ambient air. This is then combined with sustainably produced hydrogen (H2) to produce methane fuel that adds virtually no CO2 to the atmosphere. The Climeworks factory in Italy can filter no less than 150 tons of carbon dioxide from the air every year. A group of researchers at the University of Michigan is working on an environmentally friendly fuel made from algae. In addition to being more efficient than our current fossil fuels, this fuel can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent. Indoor, URBAN, and vertical agriculture remain incidentally also gaining popularity. Far fewer pesticides, water, and soil are used with these new farming techniques than with traditional farming methods. And because urban farms grow food closer to the consumer, there is also much less need for transport for this form of fruit and vegetable cultivation. This allows CO2 emissions to be reduced even further.Trend 15: 3D printing technology is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry3D printing technology, also known as additive manufacturing, has been around for a long time, but the enormous potential of this technology has only really become visible in recent years. Now more and more companies use 3D printers to make new products. For example, sportswear giant Adidas is planning to launch 100,000 pairs of shoes with 3D-printed midsoles by the end of this year. In the coming years, the company even wants to produce millions of these shoes. Aerospace giant Boeing is also interested in 3D printing technology. For example, the company uses the tech to produce air ducts and footrests and to date, there are 60,000of these 3D-printed components installed in Boeing aircraft. Researchers at the University of Minnesota are experimenting with 3D printing technology to create a soft and stretchable material. This material is better in several respects than the traditional plastic that is normally used in 3D printing. Because it is soft and stretchable, you can make its unique products with various shapes and possibilities.Trend 16: The autonomous revolution in the freight transport sectorEverything around us is becoming increasingly automated and that will be no different in the transport sector in the coming years. Because autonomous technology can make this industry much more efficient, many companies are particularly interested in it. For example, iron mining company Vale plans to replace its traditional truck fleet with autonomous vehicles in early 2019. If everything goes according to plan, there will be 13 driver-less trucks with GPS, radar and artificial intelligence on the Vale mine site in Brazil. These new trucks are estimated to reduce fuel consumption by 10 percent and significantly improve on-site safety. But trucks are not the only means of transport that become autonomous. For example, in Norway the world's first autonomous shipping company, Masterly, established. This company will start using the autonomous shipping of goods next year, using the autonomous container ship YARA Birkeland.Trend 17: 5G wireless technology - even faster, even more reliable, even more, possibilitiesWe are becoming increasingly dependent on wireless communication. And even though smartphones and other wireless technologies reasonably meet our needs and expectations, of course, even faster and more reliably is better. That can be achieved with the fifth generation of wireless technology, also known as 5G. 5G technology offers enormous benefits. In combination with sensor technology, for example, it can cause for efficient communication between autonomous vehicles, so that accidents can be prevented more often. And in the event of serious traffic problems, governments can use 5G to advise alternative routes. 5G can also improve the way we use our mobile phones many times. For example, this tech makes hologram phone calls and live interactive broadcasts possible. The British telecommunications company Vodafone recently showed how such a hologram telephone call with 5G works.Trend 18: More and more countries are introducing cryptocurrency as legal tenderSince the introduction of Bitcoin almost ten years ago, cryptocurrency has made considerable progress. Governments are also determined to start using this technology. Although Russia was not initially enthusiastic about cryptocurrency, the country has changed its mind. The Russian government has announced that it wants to introduce its virtual state currency - the CryptoRoebel. With this state currency, Russia wants to take the bitcoin out of the sails and drives it towards a national ban on bitcoin trade. The Marshall Islands are also working on their crypto coin, the Sovereign or SOV. The Marshall Islands parliament accepted a bill in March to introduce this national cryptocurrency. The SOV is issued in collaboration with Israeli technology company Neema and acts as a traditional currency used alongside the US dollar. This makes the Marshall Islands the first independent country with cryptocurrency as legal tender. Estonia, Iran, and China are also considering introducing their cryptocurrency.Trend 19: Basic Income as a solution for the consequences of automationAccording to many, self-scanning checkouts that make cashiers unnecessary, robots replacing factory workers and self-driving trucks that put drivers out on the street - that is the future we are going to. The technological revolution not only leads to more efficient companies and new products, but also to the unemployed who are in urgent need of a kind of social safety net. One way to address these challenges is to introduce a universal basic income - a regular amount of money paid out by the state to help citizens meet their basic needs. Entrepreneurs such as Richard Branson and Elon Musk are enthusiastic proponents and the governments of Canada, Finland, and several other countries have already run pilots to gain a better understanding of the pros and cons. Italy recently a basic income for the poor introduced and continue to experiment more governments around the world with this approach to find solutions to the effects of automation.Trend 20: Will the IoT finally make fully smart cities possible?The Internet of Things (IoT) will continue its impressive growth in 2019 years, and the IoT market is expected to reach a value of no less than $ 561.04 billion by 2022. This means that the current number of 3.6 billion IoT devices will grow, which will contribute to further penetration of the IoT market. We will see particularly strong growth in sectors such as the manufacturing industry and healthcare. For example, the number of connected devices in the production sector will double between now and 2020. The IoT has promise to not however completely smart cities create yet fulfilled. But projects like Sidewalk Labs Show in Toronto that we can expect at least some smart neighborhoods. Our cars are also increasingly equipped with IoT systems that, for example, monitor the oil level, fuel consumption, and tire pressure. We can assume that soon every conceivable device will be connected to the internet. And to ensure that we protect ourselves against cyberattacks, we will also need to provide these devices with robust cybersecurity.Trend 21: AI and 3D imaging give sales of e-commerce companies a boostIn an online market where competition is becoming increasingly fierce, e-commerce companies must increasingly use technology to impress their customers. One of the technologies that we will see more often in e-commerce in the future is 3D product imaging. This technology allows customers to zoom in on a product, rotate the item and view it from different angles. E-commerce companies that have implemented this tech, such as TSUM, report a 40 percent increase in their conversion. Online fashion retailers like Yoox have AI tools developed that analyze social media content, customer feedback, online magazines, and own sales data. With this information, they can advise their customers on certain clothing. The Indian e-commerce site Myntra takes a similar approach. According to Ananth Narayanan, the CEO of the company, the sale of shirts with KI-generated designs has doubled. Artificial intelligence will also play an essential role in other e-commerce segments in the coming years. Chatbots, for example, is already an important part of customer service and KI-driven analytics and ad-delivery systems enable companies to reach customers more efficiently than ever.Trend 22: The market for wearables is expanding far beyond the health and fitness sectorThe worldwide sale of wearables is growing by an average of 20 percent per year and this market will have a value of no less than $ 29 billion in 2022. Brands such as Apple, Fitbit, Jawbone, and Xiaomi are a few of the most important players in this sector and fitness trackers and smartwatches are still the most popular. Portable technology is also gaining ground in the construction sector. For example, there is a lot of demand for cooling vests, smart safety helmets and Microsoft HoloLens technology that makes the work of construction workers more efficient and safer. Physical work will also be less demanding in the future than before. For example, LG has the CLOi SuitBot exoskeleton designed to make it easier to lift heavy objects. Even life insurance companies like John Hancock use wearables. For example, they determine the level of insurance premiums with the data generated by health and fitness trackers. Policyholders who exercise regularly and eat healthy, for example, are rewarded with lower premiums, gift vouchers, and other benefits.Trend 23: Digital twins provide insight into their physical counterpartsBy creating digital twins of a physical object and dynamically adjusting them using real-time data, engineers can better monitor and analyze the performance of objects such as cars, buildings, and even jet engines. Digital twin technology is, therefore, an important tool with which engineers can develop ways to improve products and test 'what if' scenarios. This technology is even used by NASA and the US Air Force to create a new generation of vehicles. Investment management firm Goldman Sachs also uses digital twin-tech. They have the technology included in their series The Outsiders as a trend that ""condition of the contemporary investment universe on the edge"". Gartner predicts that ""by 2021 half of the large industrial companies will use digital twins, increasing the effectiveness of these organizations by 10%"".Trend 24: Organizations increasingly use technology to protect the environmentCurrent efforts to reduce global warming are not delivering the desired results. It is therefore unlikely that we will be able to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, as proposed in the Paris Agreement. This has led many organizations to rely on technology. The Environmental Defense Fund, an NGO, wants to launch a satellite to measure the amount of methane released into the atmosphere by the oil and gas industry. Methane is one of the most important man-made greenhouse gases. This data is then used to develop emission reduction strategies. Google Maps Street View cars will be coming soon equipped with Aclima's air quality sensors that measure and map carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in cities. Companies such as the Iceland-based Carbon Recycling International (CRI) even have a way found to convert carbon dioxide into methanol, which is then sold on the European fuel market. And Volkswagen wants to invest more than € 40 billion in electrification and e-mobility. These initiatives paint a picture of a global economy that increasingly focuses on environmental technology to protect our planet; a trend that is expected to continue well beyond 2019.Trend 25: We are seeing robots in more and more sectors2019 is expected to be a great year for commercial robots. Several robotics companies have already scaled up their production and many others report breakthroughs in research. Boston Dynamics, a robotics company owned by the technology company Softbank, plans to about 1,000 four-legged robots Spot Mini next year produce. These machines can be used for, among other things, elderly care, parcel delivery, construction, and security. Agility Robotics dragged $ 8 million on investments to continue the development of the two-legged robot Cassie. Among other things, this robot could help people with paraplegia. And researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University have developed a bipedal robot that can on uneven and rough terrain locomotion. Thanks to this capacity, these machines are extremely suitable for applications in space exploration and assistance during (natural) disasters. Research and innovation continue undisturbed and we expect that we will encounter these and similar robots in more and more sectors in the coming years.Being technologically 'vigilant' is no longer optional in the world of tomorrowThe rapid pace of technological development has led to a proliferation of disruptive innovations that bring about major changes. To initiate and guide digital transformation, it is important to observe, evaluate and acknowledge the potential behind emerging technological trends. Being technologically 'vigilant' is no longer optional in today's and tomorrow's world - it is increasingly becoming a prerequisite to take governments and companies to the next level.","358,181 followers",Sean Kernan,10.1K,5.6K,723.5M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-industries-in-the-next-20-years

It could impact not only how the next generation of technology is built, but how it will be governed.“Deep tech” — the fundamental innovations that provide the foundation for future generations of technology — gravitates towards the U.S. and Western Europe, where public-funded institutions and large companies invest in academic research.

In the coming years, expressions of soft power in strategically important regions are turning digital.In October, Japan, Australia, and the U.S. agreed to finance a combined $30 million to build a spur from a trans-Pacific fiber-optic cable to the tiny island nation of Palau. The project, which would increase data speeds in the country, had an unstated but obvious objective: to counter the growing influence of China in the South Pacific.Physical infrastructure has often been at the center of geopolitical competition — the “developing world” is replete with roads, railways and ports that bear the name of their donors. China’s Belt and Road initiative, which aims to build transport links from China to Southeast Asia and Central Europe, is remarkable for its scale, but the concept isn’t new.In the coming years, the focus is likely to shift from concrete to cables. Providing the technological backbone for Asian and African countries’ digital economies will give national champion companies access to huge new markets and would-be hegemons influence over strategically important regions.It could, as in Palau, give underserved regions access to vital tech; but it could also crystallize the ideological differences between global superpowers, creating new inequalities in human rights, free expression, and access to information.After the pandemicCovid-19 changed the world.

The international market is expected to hit a size of $1.5B by 2020.Technology will become more familiar to healthcare in the coming years and will provide faster and more personalized care to patients.The AR innovations can improve the ability of physicians and surgeons to diagnose, treat and perform surgery on their patients.This can be done more precisely by giving them faster and more accurate access to real-time data than ever before.AR can also add enormous value to the practice of medicine and education by helping students and trainee physicians to better imagine the health issues and situations they will one day behandling.The advantages that AR can bring to the healthcare sector can be transformative, and we are just seeing the beginning of what is to come from AR in the field of healthcare.IoT in HealthcareTheReal-time patient tracking helps to provide faster and more effective care. Emergency communication through a mobile app helps doctors to access information more easily and provide high-quality care well before the patient enters the hospital.IoT does not stand alone in the healthcare sector. All IoT devices and their networks need to be combined with other technologies to help healthcare facilities transform themselves in a meaningful way.As mentioned earlier, IoT will revolutionize the healthcare sector, but it also needs data, high-speed communication, and proper security and compliance.AI for HealthcareArtificial IntelligenceAdvances in AI transformed the technology revolution of healthcare, resulting in improved health outcomes while reducing the cost of providing healthcare.Artificial intelligence has played a key role in the industry for decades. Healthcare AI focuses on analyzing consumer health data to improve outcomes by suggesting diagnostics, reading medical device images, accelerating medical research and development, and more.More than 80 percent of the healthcare industry is currently using AI, and by 2020 the industry is expected to spend an average of $55 million on this technology.AI is emerging as a game-changer for the healthcare industry here are a few examples:-3D Printing in the Clinic3D printing is revolutionizing and improving the different industries and the healthcare sector is no exception. There are numerous benefits of 3D field printing in order to improve and save the lives of patients.Through the use of 3D printers the healthcare industry has been changed and strengthened than ever after.3D printing in healthcare allows medical professionals to provide patients with a different form of treatment in a number of waysIt is used to develop new surgical cutting and drilling guides, prosthetics and patient-specific replicas of bones, organs and blood vessels.The healthcare 3D printing market reached $578 million in 2017 and is expected to increase its value by 21.2 percent CAGR between 2018 and 2024.Benefits of 3D printing in the Healthcare Sector:-Blockchain Technology for HealthcareCritical patient data and information remain scattered across different departments and systems in the healthcare sector.As a consequence, critical information is not usable and readily available at times of need.Blockchain in healthcare enhances the overall safety of patients ‘ electronic medical records, addresses the issues of product authenticity and traceability of the drug supply chain and facilitates efficient interoperability between healthcare organizations.Blockchain technologyApproximately $34.47 million worth of sales will see a sharp rise in 2024, with profits rising to $1415.59 million. In addition, CAGR growth will be around 70.45 percent between 2018-24.This is for sure, that blockchain can enhance security in healthcare organizations which will protect sensitive data from external threats and attacks by using multiple encrypted blocks rather than a single database.ConclusionAs we discussed above, these technical development are going to revolutionize healthcare this year and beyond.You can expect that superior, safer and quality healthcare services will be provided to patients and that the patient’s own health and well-being will be more closely accessible to them.Change in innovation is exponential and the healthcare sector is primed to take advantage of the productivity it has gained.Time is going to teach us what innovation has the power to transform medicine and general health for the better.","246,654 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,231.6M,15.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-industries-in-the-next-20-years

One form consists of a circular pipe enclosing a helix and inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees to the horizontal with its lower end dipped in the water; rotation of the device causes the water to rise in the pipe. Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The Archimedes Screw is still used today in some limited applications (usually electrically-powered), and can range in size from a quarter of an inch to nearly 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. A large screw or banks of screws may be used to pump rainstorm runoff or to lift water or wastewater, for example.2.THE BATTERY-The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is a clay pot which encapsulates a copper cylinder. Suspended in the centre of this cylinder but not touching it is an iron rod. Both the copper cylinder and the iron rod are held in place with an asphalt plug. These artifacts (more than one was found) were discovered during the 1936 excavations of the old village Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad. The village is considered to be about 2000 years old, and was built during the Parthian period (250BC to 224 AD). Although it is not known exactly what the use of such a device would have been, the name ‘Baghdad Battery’, comes from one of the prevailing theories established in 1938 when Wilhelm Konig, the German archaeologist who performed the excavations, examined the battery and concluded that this device was an ancient electric battery. After the Second World War, Willard Gray, an American working at the General Electric High Voltage Laboratory in Pittsfield, built replicas and, filling them with an electrolyte, found that the devices could produce 2 volts of electricity. The question remains, if it really was a battery, what was it used to power?3. THE CALENDAR-Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.4.STEAM ENGINE-Heron Alexandrinus, otherwise known as the Hero of Alexandria, was a 1st century Greek mathematician and engineer who is known as the first inventor of the steam engine. His steam powered device was called the aeolipile, named after Aiolos, God of the winds. The aeolipile consisted of a sphere positioned in such a way that it could rotate around its axis. Nozzles opposite each other would expel steam and both of the nozzles would generate a combined thrust resulting in torque, causing the sphere to spin around its axis. The rotation force sped up the sphere up to the point where the resistance from traction and air brought it to a stable rotation speed. The steam was created by boiling water under the sphere – the boiler was connected to the rotating sphere through a pair of pipes that at the same time served as pivots for the sphere.Some old steam engines are still used in certain areas of the world and in antique locomotives. However, steam power is still heavily used around the world in various applications. Many modern electrical plants use steam generated by burning coal to produce electricity.5.Earthquake Detector 132 A D -Earthquake Detector 132 A D According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe.6.Paper Money 9th century A.D.-Paper money were first developed by the ancient Chinese, who started using folding money at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century AD. Paper bills were originally used as privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes. A merchant could deposit his cash in the capital, receiving a paper “exchange certificate” which he could exchange for metal coins in other cities.Thanks for scrolling,Sandip bhatnagar.",719 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-future-trends-how-will-the-technology-be-in-the-future-of-this-components

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend.

While your industry may not be as volatile or prone to change as the tech industry, technology driven change is coming to your industry via new products and services enabled by theRecently, in the world of technology, there has been a substantial buzz about the Internet of Things and you should pay attention too. Experts and researchers agree the Internet of Things will bring significant change to both your personal and professional lives in the years to come. The tech stack that powers the internet of things — or Thing Stack as we like to call it — enables your company to create new products and services, which help you differentiate your offerings from competitors.What is the Internet of Things?The Internet of Things refers to a network of internet-connected objects like vehicles, devices and buildings. Objects are embedded with sensors and electronics to allow them to both collect and transfer information to your cloud database. The Internet of Things allows objects produced by your company to be detected and controlled remotely via existing network infrastructure. This in turn creates the opportunity for a direct integration between your physical and digital worlds. Automated IoT systems gather, report and crunch your data faster and more accurately than humans who manually gather and enter information into your database. The end result is a system that provides value to your company in new and exciting ways.IoTWhat is a technology stack?Traditionally, the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates after frameworks, languages, protocols and standards are defined. Each layer in a technology stack needs to integrate and communicate with the other layers of the stack. As a tech stack matures, it becomes easier and less expensive for your developers — if you have them — to create new products and services.The IoT stack is rapidly developing and maturing into the Thing Stack. This Thing Stack consists of three technology layers: sensors, microcontrollers and internet connectivity, and service platforms.New solutions, choices, and technologies are developing and emerging rapidly in each of the three layers because use cases differ based on industry, price point, object size, processor speed, power requirements and networking constraints. For example, a utility application intended to monitor a smart meter doesn't have the same connectivity requirements as a healthcare application designed to monitor a patient's heart rate.Your enterpriseLayer 1: SensorsSensors have been used for years in a number of different industry contexts like healthcare, aviation, manufacturing and automotive. Now, sensors are so tiny and inexpensive they can be embedded in all the devices you use personally and professionally. The sensor layer of the IoT tech stack continues to expand as internet connected sensors are added to new products and services.Besides incorporating sensors into your smartphones and tablets, your innovative competitors are introducing new devices that contain numerous sensors. These sensors don't need to be connected directly to the internet and they sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth LE to send captured data to the cloud. For example, Sensordrone is a Kickstarter project that embeds many environmental sensors into a small dongle. Some of the environmental sensors include color intensity, humidity, gas, and pressure sensors. The dongle collects information about your physical environment and sends this information to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. This example demonstrates how value can be created by new services that use sensors to gather new types of data from your physical environment.Another category of sensors are embedded in watches, contact lenses, wristbands, and fabrics. Recently, Nokia patented a technique for magnetic tattoos that vibrate from incoming messages or calls. This is possible by spray tattooing or stamping a material onto your skin. The material is then paired with a smartphone or tablet, which lets you interact with the sensor. Microsoft and University of Washington researchers are working on another way to connect sensors to your body through the use of IoT contact lenses that provide real-time updates about the biochemical fluctuations in your body. One use case is to help diabetes patients monitor their insulin levels while using these contact lenses.Layer 2: Microcontrollers and internet connectivityThe second layer in the Internet of Things technology stack allows for local storage, data processing and internet connectivity. The Internet of Things needs internet connectivity to send collected data to your cloud database. Because some sensors generate over 10,000 data points per second, it makes sense to pre-process data locally before sending it to your cloud database. By analyzing, extracting and summarizing your collected data before you send it to your cloud database, you reduce the volume of unnecessary data you send to and store on your cloud database, saving you money on data transfer and storage costs.Your microcontroller is a small computer embedded within a chip and it helps your IoT device store and pre-process collected data before it's synced to your cloud database. Your microcontroller possesses a processor, a small amount of RAM to hold data, some kilobytes of EPROM or flash memory to hold embedded software, and solid-date memory to cache data.In some cases, your IoT device may need to use programmable microcontrollers to take action and turn something on or off. In most cases, these decisions are made via a cloud application, but it makes sense to use programmable microcontrollers when a sensor detects something that could affect the health and safety of your end customers.The main and most important capability of this layer is networking, which is either wireless or wired. If a device is stationary and can access an external power source, a wired network is sufficient, but a wired network doesn't make sense for many IoT use cases because physical cables are needed to connect to the network. WiFi, wireless modems, and wireless mesh networks are the most common ways IoT devices are connected to the internet.If you plan to manufacture an IoT device you must keep in mind dependencies for your use cases. Is your device mobile or fixed? Does your device need a battery or is it connected to a fixed power supply? How much data do you need to transfer to your cloud database per hour? Should your device's connectivity be episodic or continuous?Devices you use to track your health and fitness while bicycling, running, and exercising store data while you're active, and these devices use episodic connectivity. Your device then syncs with the cloud when it's close to your smartphone or tablet. Compare this to the continuous connectivity needed by Amazon Echo's voice based digital assistant who is always listening for your commands, fetching answers from the internet the instant you ask a question. Depending on your IoT product's use cases, you may need continuous connectivity.When you research Think Stack vendors, you'll notice a wide range of different networking protocols, hardware, software, and architectures are used to build IoT products. Due to the variation in use cases and environments, you have many choices when it comes to adding networking and computing capabilities your IoT device. While some vendors focus more on hardware components, other vendors provide a system of integrated software and hardware. Sometimes, IoT software solutions spill into the third layer of the Thing Stack, which is referred to as the service platform.Layer 3: Service platformsThe first two layers for the Thing Stack embed sensor and microcomputers in your IoT device, but your IoT product profits from the service platform layer. This layer delivers value to your customers by automating processes and delivering rich data analytics. Your cloud application combines data collected from numerous IoT sensors with your (or your customers) other business data to produce insights that generate business value.It's important for your service platform to create a feedback loop between your IoT devices and you device management software, so you and your customers can upgrade, monitor, and maintain the firmware on each the device. In most cases, service platforms operate on cloud infrastructure and utilize a multi-tenant software architecture to deliver a seamless software-as-a-service (SaaS) experience.The convergence between our digital and physical worlds stresses your IT operations by increasing demand for data management, storage, tagging and analysis. It's in your company's best interests to build your IoT service platform on robust cloud infrastructure, so you can scale infinitely as your business grows with your new IoT product.While ""software is eating the world"" as Marc Andreessen said, consumers and companies still purchase a lot of physical things. If you build a robust IoT service platform, you obtain insights about how your customers use your IoT products and services. With a great IoT service platform you can manage post-transaction relationships in new and engaging ways.Because service platforms store and make decisions based on data collected from all types of IoT devices, they are often considered the backbone of post-transactions relationships. What if you reached out to customers who never powered on your IoT device and proactively on-boarded them? What if you used anonymized data from customers getting the most value out of your product to help other customers unlock more business value?Now is the time to build your IoT product because sensors keep getting smaller and network connectivity solutions keep getting better. Create a plan to engage with your customers and facilitate goal-oriented post-transaction relationships, leading to new opportunities to turn a single transaction into a strong relationship.How to extract value from the Thing Stack?The Thing Stack isn't just for emerging companies or technology companies. The Thing Stack will revolutionize your industry and create efficiencies and new products your customers love. With end-to-end IoT solutions, you can now redefine your relationship customers and create new data-driven goal oriented outcomes. When you can measure everything, you can identify problems your customers have early and intervene to create positive outcomes.Now that you understand the Thing Stack, it's up to you to create an IoT product that changes the way you interact with your customers.","37,422 followers",Xavier Amatriain,629,297,8.4M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-technology-stack-used-in-IOT-product-Internet-of-Things

I’m going to further assume that the device needs to be very lightweight, with a small memory footprint, minimal permanent local storage and low power consumption. A lightweight device like this will have the smallest footprint on all dimensions if you build it ontop of a microkernel, such as FreeRTOS. That’s also going to be the most difficult to work with for most people, so if your device isn't as constrained, you can use embedded Linux or even Windows (I’ve used both).For an embedded Linux system, you might look at the Rasberry Pi system. The Rasberry is s small, single board IoT conputer that runs Ubuntu, Debian, or a few other OSs (including Windows 10 IoT). There are versions with built in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, and audio/video output. All in all, it's not a bad starting point.I could go on at length about many of the other system layers that you might need.

This Thing Stack consists of three technology layers: sensors, microcontrollers and internet connectivity, and service platforms.New solutions, choices, and technologies are developing and emerging rapidly in each of the three layers because use cases differ based on industry, price point, object size, processor speed, power requirements and networking constraints. For example, a utility application intended to monitor a smart meter doesn't have the same connectivity requirements as a healthcare application designed to monitor a patient's heart rate.Your enterprise IoT application designer reviews your use cases, device requirements and existing data to better understand how to create value. By better understanding each layer of the Thinks Stack, you make better decisions about the technologies you should use for your IoT product.Layer 1: SensorsSensors have been used for years in a number of different industry contexts like healthcare, aviation, manufacturing and automotive. Now, sensors are so tiny and inexpensive they can be embedded in all the devices you use personally and professionally. The sensor layer of the IoT tech stack continues to expand as internet connected sensors are added to new products and services.Besides incorporating sensors into your smartphones and tablets, your innovative competitors are introducing new devices that contain numerous sensors. These sensors don't need to be connected directly to the internet and they sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth LE to send captured data to the cloud. For example, Sensordrone is a Kickstarter project that embeds many environmental sensors into a small dongle. Some of the environmental sensors include color intensity, humidity, gas, and pressure sensors. The dongle collects information about your physical environment and sends this information to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. This example demonstrates how value can be created by new services that use sensors to gather new types of data from your physical environment.Another category of sensors are embedded in watches, contact lenses, wristbands, and fabrics. Recently, Nokia patented a technique for magnetic tattoos that vibrate from incoming messages or calls. This is possible by spray tattooing or stamping a material onto your skin. The material is then paired with a smartphone or tablet, which lets you interact with the sensor. Microsoft and University of Washington researchers are working on another way to connect sensors to your body through the use of IoT contact lenses that provide real-time updates about the biochemical fluctuations in your body. One use case is to help diabetes patients monitor their insulin levels while using these contact lenses.Layer 2: Microcontrollers and internet connectivityThe second layer in the Internet of Things technology stack allows for local storage, data processing and internet connectivity. The Internet of Things needs internet connectivity to send collected data to your cloud database. Because some sensors generate over 10,000 data points per second, it makes sense to pre-process data locally before sending it to your cloud database. By analyzing, extracting and summarizing your collected data before you send it to your cloud database, you reduce the volume of unnecessary data you send to and store on your cloud database, saving you money on data transfer and storage costs.Your microcontroller is a small computer embedded within a chip and it helps your IoT device store and pre-process collected data before it's synced to your cloud database. Your microcontroller possesses a processor, a small amount of RAM to hold data, some kilobytes of EPROM or flash memory to hold embedded software, and solid-date memory to cache data.In some cases, your IoT device may need to use programmable microcontrollers to take action and turn something on or off. In most cases, these decisions are made via a cloud application, but it makes sense to use programmable microcontrollers when a sensor detects something that could affect the health and safety of your end customers.The main and most important capability of this layer is networking, which is either wireless or wired. If a device is stationary and can access an external power source, a wired network is sufficient, but a wired network doesn't make sense for many IoT use cases because physical cables are needed to connect to the network. WiFi, wireless modems, and wireless mesh networks are the most common ways IoT devices are connected to the internet.If you plan to manufacture an IoT device you must keep in mind dependencies for your use cases. Is your device mobile or fixed? Does your device need a battery or is it connected to a fixed power supply? How much data do you need to transfer to your cloud database per hour? Should your device's connectivity be episodic or continuous?Devices you use to track your health and fitness while bicycling, running, and exercising store data while you're active, and these devices use episodic connectivity. Your device then syncs with the cloud when it's close to your smartphone or tablet. Compare this to the continuous connectivity needed by Amazon Echo's voice based digital assistant who is always listening for your commands, fetching answers from the internet the instant you ask a question. Depending on your IoT product's use cases, you may need continuous connectivity.When you research Think Stack vendors, you'll notice a wide range of different networking protocols, hardware, software, and architectures are used to build IoT products. Due to the variation in use cases and environments, you have many choices when it comes to adding networking and computing capabilities your IoT device. While some vendors focus more on hardware components, other vendors provide a system of integrated software and hardware. Sometimes, IoT software solutions spill into the third layer of the Thing Stack, which is referred to as the service platform.Layer 3: Service platformsThe first two layers for the Thing Stack embed sensor and microcomputers in your IoT device, but your IoT product profits from the service platform layer. This layer delivers value to your customers by automating processes and delivering rich data analytics. Your cloud application combines data collected from numerous IoT sensors with your (or your customers) other business data to produce insights that generate business value.It's important for your service platform to create a feedback loop between your IoT devices and you device management software, so you and your customers can upgrade, monitor, and maintain the firmware on each the device. In most cases, service platforms operate on cloud infrastructure and utilize a multi-tenant software architecture to deliver a seamless software-as-a-service (SaaS) experience.The convergence between our digital and physical worlds stresses your IT operations by increasing demand for data management, storage, tagging and analysis. It's in your company's best interests to build your IoT service platform on robust cloud infrastructure, so you can scale infinitely as your business grows with your new IoT product.While ""software is eating the world"" as Marc Andreessen said, consumers and companies still purchase a lot of physical things. If you build a robust IoT service platform, you obtain insights about how your customers use your IoT products and services. With a great IoT service platform you can manage post-transaction relationships in new and engaging ways.Because service platforms store and make decisions based on data collected from all types of IoT devices, they are often considered the backbone of post-transactions relationships. What if you reached out to customers who never powered on your IoT device and proactively on-boarded them? What if you used anonymized data from customers getting the most value out of your product to help other customers unlock more business value?Now is the time to build your IoT product because sensors keep getting smaller and network connectivity solutions keep getting better. Create a plan to engage with your customers and facilitate goal-oriented post-transaction relationships, leading to new opportunities to turn a single transaction into a strong relationship.How to extract value from the Thing Stack?The Thing Stack isn't just for emerging companies or technology companies. The Thing Stack will revolutionize your industry and create efficiencies and new products your customers love. With end-to-end IoT solutions, you can now redefine your relationship customers and create new data-driven goal oriented outcomes. When you can measure everything, you can identify problems your customers have early and intervene to create positive outcomes.Now that you understand the Thing Stack, it's up to you to create an IoT product that changes the way you interact with your customers.","1,227 followers",Paul Sciarra,543,0,0,2.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-technology-stack-used-in-IOT-product-Internet-of-Things

You can typically find these legacy embedded systems in AI assume you already have this answer. I’m just going to give a perspective on the history and evolution of embedded systems from stand alone devices to IOT systems.The Older Embedded Systems (May be some 20+ years Old)I have worked on re-design of few of the older embedded systems which were based on i386 processor and Older TI processors. You can typically find these legacy embedded systems in Aerospace industry. The reason being, the stringent product certification policy in Aerospace industry doesn’t call for frequent system up gradation. So, the older systems are very much used till date unless the chips or technology getting obsolete and you are forced to re-design the system.These legacy devices are stand alone, they don’t have network connectivity, they don’t have USB, they don’t support LCD display, they don’t have WiFI. All they support is Rs232 port, VFD (Vacuum Florescent Display ) and the firmware running out of NOR flash. The code is bare metal written in Assembly + C.The only way, these legacy embedded systems talk to external world is using RS232 port. All firmware upgrade, system configuration upgrade happens through RS232 port. It was very difficult to manage and control these older systems, even to the extent of firmware upgrade, capture error logs etc.Evolution of Embedded SystemsIf you see the evolution of embedded systems, you will get a better picture to understand the answer to this question. Initially the embedded systems were standalone devices running assembly or bare metal c code, as the technology evolved, the embedded systems were capable of running OS and could connect to wired or wireless network. With the evolution of internet and the invention of smartphones, the usage of internet and internet based services became very popular and handy. People started getting information in their finger tips.So, on one side the embedded technology was evolving from 8 bit processor to 16 bit, 32 bit and now 64 bit processor, supporting multi core architecture, operating at gigahertz clock, supporting gigabytes of memory, having integrated peripherals and capable of running operating systems, on the other side the network connectivity, wifi, gigabit networks, the internet (3G, 4G networks) , smartphones, cloud services, big data was evolving.As the technology evolved, the once standalone embedded systems were capable of supporting all types of network connectivity using wireless or wired networks. With this, it was easier to manage and control the huge chunk of embedded devices. Remote monitoring and control of the embedded devices was made possible.Smartphones took the internet connectivity to next level. Mobile apps helped people to always get connected to internet to use the internet based services such as bill payment, e commerce, social networking, video chat, etc.People started using their mobile apps to remotely control and manage the embedded systems. The home automation systems, video surveillance systems etc were remotely controlled and managed by mobile apps. The concepts such as smart homes, smart building etc started evolving.Gradually the embedded systems became more intelligent, more connected, more user friendly. It was possible to run data analytics on embedded systems, it was possible to connect to cloud and push the data, it was possible to provide a mobile app for monitoring and controlling these systems. So, the once standalone system evolved into the systems which can connect to cloud.At this point, people started talking about Internet of Things,Smart homes, Smart Building, etc.Even though all these terminologies look different but somewhere in the background they are connected, we need to just connect these dots to get the holistic view.Thousands of embedded systems such as sensors, thermostats, surveillance cameras, video recorders etc were producing huge amount of data. This data was to be captured, processed to create a meaning full information. This information could be used to understand the system behaviour, customer behaviour, the failure modes, firmware upgrade status, and many more things to better manage and handle these systems.The evolution of Inten...",0 followers,Tom Crosley,659,2.6K,22.9M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-technology-stack-used-in-IOT-product-Internet-of-Things

The Internet of Things growth. Computers were developed in the 1950s.The Internet was founded by DARPA (Defense Advanced Projects Agency) in 1962 and became an ARPANET in 1969. The Internet itself is an essential component of the IoT. Business service providers started to encourage the use and transformation of ARPANET into our modern website in the 1980's. The Department of Defense has made a stable , highly functional system of 24 satellites a fact in early 1993. This was soon followed by private satellites, which were put in space. Satellites and landlines provide a significant part of the IoT with simple communications.IPV6 made a remarkable intelligent decision to increase the number of addresses an additional and significant factor in the creation of a functional IoT. ""We can allocate an IPV6 address to every atom on the earth's surface and still have ample addresses left for another 100 + earths,"" says Steve Leibson of the Computer History Museum. ""Additionally we will not run off internet addresses at any time.2. Concept RealizationOnly in 1999 was the Internet of Things formally called as a term. The Carnegie Melon University was the first Coca Cola machine on the Internet of Things from the early 80s. Local programmers would connect the cooled appliance to the Internet and check whether drinks were available and if it was cold before the journey.The Internet of Things had grown in 2013 into a multi-technology system, from the Internet to wireless and micro elector-mechanical systems to embedded systems. The IoT is enabled by conventional automation (including home and building automation), wireless sensor networks, GPS systems , control systems etc.The Internet of Things consists of any computer connected to the internet with an on / off switch. This covers virtually everything you can think of, from cellular phones to building repairs to an aircraft jet engine. The data transfer can be transmitted across a network and members of the IoT through Medical devices such as a heart monitor or a biochip transponder for a livestock animal. If you have an off / on switch, it may be part of the device technically. The IoT has a vast network of ""things"" and devices linked to the internet. An excellent example of a modern Internet of Things addition can be found in Ring, a doorbell connected to your smartphone.3. New Methods to Connect DevicesConsider the phrase, ""any system that can be linked together with other devices,"" while thinking about IoT. IoT is ready for fresh and innovative concepts that can add to current tasks. Imagine an alarm at 6 a.m. to warn the coffee maker simultaneously to turn on and start brewing coffee. Imagine your printer understanding when you run low on paper and order more automatically. Imagine your wrist watch saying ""where"" you were the most effective at work. The IoT can be used to coordinate transport networks, for example. ""smart cities"" will use it for waste reduction and optimising energy usage.Actually, the IoT offers an interconnection of our devices and equipment that is almost infinite. This creative area is wide open and provides a broad variety of ways to ""link devices."" Partly because the effect of these interconnections is not well known, it may be an exciting time for imaginative individuals. IoT presents future security issues as well as opportunities. The Internet of Things is actually better looked at with an open spirit, for imagination and a protective mentality for privacy and protection.4. User PrivacyAs sensors and video cameras become more popular, especially in public spaces, consumers are becoming less aware of and have no way to avoid information collected.Many people are uneasy about the possibility of corporations gathering information on this topic and even more uneasy about selling it to everyone. Older people typically disagree with more information than young people about themselves collected, but according to one inquiry about 45% of ""all"" respondents have refused to trust organizations to use the information they collected to protect their privacy.Actually, privacy options are rather black and white. The customer is required to give up all anonymity, or the customer actually can access the service (often in an arrangement, so that people do not bother ploughing through it). This has contributed to ongoing debates on digital privacy and how best to inform consumers about privacy and data access.5. SecurityWhile measures need to be taken to ensure protection, this problem should not be surprised if it is an important concern for the growth of the IoT. Millions of computers are actually interconnected, allowing (eventually) people to hack into your coffee making facility and then access your whole network. In addition , the Internet of Things makes organizations worldwide more vulnerable to security threats. Furthermore, the use of the Internet of Things makes data sharing and privacy a problem. Take into account how issues will evolve as millions of devices are connected.This statistic shows the Internet of Things (IoT) security spending worldwide from 2016 to 2021, by segment.

All of the heavily traded cryptocurrencies are powered by some version of a distributed ledger (blockchain), and each has at least one unique attribute that differentiates it. Here's an overview of 5 popular cryptocurrencies and how they compare to Bitcoin.Note1. LitecoinValue: $77.39 | Market Cap: $4.43 billion USD as ofLitecoin though many online merchant now accept it as well. As means of paymentLitecoin vs. Bitcoin: Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is easy to buy and sell for cash on mainstream exchanges (like Coinbase), and you can also open a Litecoin debit card for easy use. Its primary advantage over Bitcoin (and the main reason it was created is its faster block generation rate, which means faster transaction confirmations. While Bitcoin transactions tend to take ten plus minutes to settle, Litecoin transactions are often settled in a quarter of that time. Litecoin's Scrypt algorithm also makes mining easier for people without high-end graphics cards.2. EthereumValue: $445.92 | Market Cap: $44.9 billion USDOne of the most popular uses of Ether is to purchase shares in intial coins offering (ICOs).Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Rather than simply mining Ethereum, miners must work to earn Ether. Another major difference between the two is how they use blockchain. Bitcoin uses blockchain to record immutable records of transactions, while Ethereum uses it to create decentralized computational platforms, which enable Distributed Applications (DApps) and smart contracts to be built and run without third-party interference, fraud, or downtime.3. DashValue: $227.73 | Market Cap: $1.88 billion USDDash's primary use (much like Bitcoin) is as a cryptocurrency, with more than 1400 merchant accepting it as a form of payment. Dash offers instant transactions (called InstantSend) and private transactions (PrivateSend). Dash powers these transactions through a two-tier network of nodes and Masternodes; as mining and transactions are powered by separate networks, transactions take only a few seconds.Dash vs. Bitcoin: Considering its ambitions to be a primary form of currency, Dash aims to be both cheaper and faster than Bitcoin. In my own way i say Dash is ""what Bitcoin should have been."") Unlike other cryptocurrencies on this list, Dash is not a fork of Bitcoin, but rather uses its own blockchain and mining system.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,5.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-cryptocurrency-mining-profitable-in-the-USA

The most comprehensive and effective article by Peter Altmaier (see below) covers so much ground that it is almost impossible to summarise, and I have struggled to do that, as shown below. But also see Sigurt Vitol’s thoughtful and considered paper about GERMAN INDUSTRIAL POLICY: AN OVERVIEW which can be downloaded at2.1.1 The Objective of the Policy: The Creation, Across All of The German Economy, Advanced Computerised “Smart Factories” with a major upgrading in the optimised computerised interconnection of factory operations from raw materials, subcomponent and energy inputs to specific, individual-customer-specified outputs.As Peter Altmaier, the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Germany has summarised it, in“Germany has a strong and successful industrial base. We need to keep it that way, we need to expand that.”In his lengthy and utterly specific article, he describes a policy which is the “fourth industrial revolution” which he names and describes:“INDUSTRIE 4.0Digitally driven and smartly networked“Digitally controlled production processes, smart factories and a networking of sales, production and logistics: the term ""Industrie 4.0"" describes a fourth industrial revolution which is picking up speed in the wake of rapid digitalisation.” And the description of the technology is“Industrie 4.0 combines production methods with state-of-the-art information and communication technology. This smart approach makes it possible to deliver tailored products to meet individual customer requirements – at low cost and in high quality. Highly flexible production methods and logistics will make it possible to customise products. Customers and business partners will be directly involved in operational and production processes, and there will be production methods and products that are closely intertwined with state-of-the-art, knowledge-intensive services (hybrid production, hybrid products).”So the system involves the implied digitally-controlled minimal inputs of energy, water and raw materials, combined with the just-in-time delivery of highest quality SME subcomponents to be assembled into a low cost, high quality customer-specified customised product which can “talk” through the internet of things to its maker, its buyer and the network of things around it.(Presumably the first three industrial revolutions the Federal Minister may have in mind may be the previous IR stages of the ages of steam, of electricity production and consumption, and of computers/internet communications, and of all the associated developments in these eras.)2.1.2 The Major Industrial Sectors AffectedIndustrie4.0/Germany4.0““The process of technological transformation and the trend towards sharing knowledge and information on an ever-growing scale are continuing at unabated speed. Similarly, new developments in information and communication technology are having a considerable impact on the production of complex goods and services requiring a great deal of research and expertise.SoThe paper goes on to demonstrate that export performance, the growing importance of export-related services, and highlights more industries which have “Innovative technologies with potential for the future” which are listed as“Within the framework of the Federal Government’sIn addition to all of the above, Germany intends to2.2 TheAs2.2.1 The Origin of the PolicyChinese Premier3 The Comparisons Between Germany and ChinaBoth Germany and China have a highly educated and skilled workforce with millions of SMEs, many of which are acting at the forefront of their technology.Both countries fund the Wernerian transfer of invention to innovation in millions of their SMEs through effective local banking systems which help finance that process.4 The Differences Between the4.1 German Support for SME invention and InnovationAlthough Germany has a highly effective Sparkassen local public banking system to fund the establishment, development and updating of SMEs in each locality, Germany has a partly rationalised Sparkassen Banking System which, although the most effective in the world for a nation of Germany’s size, has the following sub-optimal characteristicsOne of the few jokes told by the“No - East Germany proves that the Germans can make anything work.” The relatively high growth rates of Communist East Germany (from 1945 to the 1960s) were due to the continuation of Germany’s Sparkassen Banks with their century and half traditions, of supporting SMEs even under Communist rule.Let me be as precise as the numbers can indicate: Herbert Simon has provided in his essay and book about the Hidden Champions of Germany the following dataWhich data I have summarised in the following generated table:More recent figures indicate that Germany has raised its delivery of “Hidden Champions” to above 1,600 with the result that the German level of champions per million people is about 20. It seems to me that a sub-analysis of the data is likely to show that some West German states are achieving hidden champion rates of about 25 champions per million people.Germany does not have an adequate system for the growth of “Hidden Champions” to world-serving scale, because it does not understand or use Shimomuran macroeconomics. Germany succeeds through the excellence of SME family firms and the few but large bank-supported major industries without having a “capital abundance” in all of its its manufacturing industry. Germany’s growth rate has always been intermediate because of that reality. The focus of German industry and politicians is upon Germany, and theThe EU is unfortunately being run by Germany as if it were a German Empire. Such an outcome was never intended by its founders who established and intended a co-operating commonwealth of collaborating nations. German politicians should grow into European citizens and while a “Germany first” bias inIn my view the level of invention and innovation is a constant capability of all peoples. When Scotland was the beneficiary of the slave-trading profits of the Tobacco Lords these funds (along with some Sugar Lord monies also based upon black slavery) founded the local Glasgow-centred banks of Scotland and invested in the 88 companies that were the foundation of the local industrial revolution. When England had at most 900 Provincial Banks these institutions funded the conversion of invention to innovation in England and that created the English part of the industrial revolution from about 1750 to 1880. All of that is well documented in sources too numerous and too voluminous to quote here.5 The Industrial Coverage ofThe Chinese data in the above table is incomplete because many Chinese SMEs are larger than the Hermann Simon definition as “having a revenue below $4bn”I have calculated the number of SMEs China should have, if the German number of SMEs per million people, is applied to China. About a third of Chinese SMEs seem to be missing, particularly in the western and central provinces of China where local bank SME support seems less supportive than the excellent local bank facilities in the Eastern coastal provinces and around Beijing.I have emailed (with no response so far) various Chinese economists and authorities pointing out that China could be growing more rapidly (I estimate by up to an extra 5%pa for decades) if these SME-supporting bank facilities were extended in western and central China.6 The Centrality of 5G Communications to the AI/IoT economy[Note: In some of the following quoted texts about 5G development, theThe upgrading in mobile phone and internet connections from the 4G system to 5G is a key component of the success of the new“China’s road to 5G has been well planned. In 2012, two years before China Mobile launched 4G services on the mainland, various Chinese entities joined an international initiative to research and develop 5G.“With peak data rates up to 20 times faster than 4G, 5G will serve as “the connective tissue” for new mobile applications, such as the internet of things, autonomous cars and smart cities – providing the backbone for the industrial internet, according to a Deloitte report.“On the consumer side, 5G smartphone users will be able to send high-resolution 4K video within a few seconds, and both video games and apps based on augmented and virtual reality technologies will be seamless. The 5G networks will also be able to support the growing number of connected devices globally, from fitness-tracking watches to internet-linked televisions and smart speakers at home.“The International Telecommunications Union, the United Nations agency overseeing development of the “IMT 2020” global standard for 5G, saidLet’s list these again, for these upgraded characteristics are astonishingAs the above report continues:“The agency works in tandem with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an international collaboration of seven telecoms standard development organisations that draw up complete mobile system specifications.The 3GPP recently approved the much-anticipated global technology specifications for 5G, which is expected to kick off initial deployments by some of the world’s largest telecoms network operators either later this year or early in 2019.There are two sets of specifications completed under the 3GPP: one is called “5G stand-alone”, which was approved in June, while the other one passed in December 2017 is known as “5G non-stand-alone”.”China has been steeped in the proposed 5G trials, testing and upgrading of mobile phone and IoT Communications from 4G to 5G, as this chart illustrates:And where is the USA in all this? US phone producer companies are involved but Trump seems to imagine that the USA has the power to call a halt on the essential development of this massive upgrading to 5G mobile/IoT services in which America has not been centrally involved.As“Gear based on the 5G stand-alone specifications is designed to run independently of 4G networks – and this is the standard China is pushing. Operators will need to rebuild their core network and buy new 5G base stations to provide higher data speeds and greater capacity,“The Chinese government wants every industry to use the most advanced infrastructure to upgrade productivity. This is a strategic agenda, and they think that 5G will help,” said Jefferies equity analyst Edison Lee, who covers Hong Kong-listed ZTE, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. He goes on to say“China has very ambitious plans to promote the industrial internet of things, cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), the capabilities of which require the support of brand-new 5G networks.”“For example, self-driving cars require sensors, AI and roadside base stations for fast and reliable connectivity to allow vehicles to “talk” to each other to avoid collisions and avoid pedestrians. Today’s 4G networks cannot meet those quick response times.“China’s plan for an aggressive 5G roll-out is in line with the MIC2025 road map. Initially, this focused on the domestic telecoms sector’s ability to increase broadband penetration nationwide to 82 per cent by 2025 as part of a push for industrial modernisation. Another objective was to see local suppliers making 40 per cent of all mobile phone chips used in the domestic market.“Under an updated version published in January, Beijing now wants China to become the world’s leading maker of telecoms equipment. Two of the world’s biggest telecoms gear suppliers, Shenzhen-based Huawei and ZTE, have helped lead China’s 5G research and development efforts.”7 Discussion7.1 The Implications Of Both Industrial ProgrammesBoth Germany and China are going to have the most advanced industrial manufacturing economies and best consumer life experiences in the world.7.2 The Trump Effect In Accelerating China’s DevelopmentWhen Trump banned the export of Intel microchips to China, the Chinese developed their own microchips within 14 months. Donald Trump’s forced march has brought the title of the “World’s fastest computer” back to the USA by June 12 2018 but China has 82 more supercomputers than the USA does. SeeAnd also see“According to7.3 The USA Is the Likely Loser, Whatever OccursPresident Trump appears to be trying to persuade the entire Anglosphere - the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia and the EU- to remain as a group of backward economies, staying with the slower 4G based communications while China and Asia adopt the much higher 5G standard. Of course Trump the Luddite does not know what he is doing nor understand the implications of what he does. The development of smart factories and cities requires smart politicians and Trump is not that.I do not wish to compare the likely results of an integrated 5G-based military technology operating at up to 20 times the speed of a 4G-based technology. But even the most approximate initial comparison indicates that the USA, as has happened since the manufacturing-industry-exporting Ronald Reagan, has failed to invest or participate not only in the development of 5G but also has failed to keep its key once-major industries within its borders and continually updated, and these events inevitably have significant military implications.The American Republican/Conservative preference for “Rule by, for and of the rich” produces a profound disdain for manufacturing, a neglect of the living standards of workers through Austerity, a rot of US roads and public services through “small government”, and a pathological culture in domestic and foreign relations. FDR was much better than that. Trump isn’t.8 Conclusions8.1 The Recent New Initiatives of8.2 The development of smart factories, smart cities and smart economies within a smarter environment is the inevitable next stage in the economic history of the world. It is unstoppable and inevitable and very helpful to the futures of Germany and China and perhaps in future in Europe and very probably in Asia.8.3 The USA needs to “get on board” and adopt these fresh industrial renewal processes and these policies and not to try to prevent progress in Germany and China. Or the USA could just politically accept the continuation of its trajectory of relative economic decline, which under current leadership seems inevitable. Alternatively, as a first step, the USA needs to study how rapid economic growth is financed in today’s world and adopt more people-serving policies. In my view there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of very capable American politicians, perhaps a majority of them women, who could reverse US economic decline.

The list also includes a demand that China end some of its policies related to technology transfers, a key source of tension underlying the dispute.So now the US Government is officially demanding $200 billion per year from China, up from $100 billion. And of course, the US Government still wants China to reduce domestic investment and development.The article above edited this part out that I saved:The U.S. wants China not to retaliate against U.S. measures currently being pursued against it.Wow this really paints the US Government in a truly evil light, they can attack and hurt you but you cannot defend yourself by retaliating. That’s some exceptional privilege!

For instance, the U.S. says China should agree not to target U.S. farmers or agricultural products and “not oppose, challenge or otherwise retaliate” when the U.S. moves to restrict Chinese investment in the U.S. in sensitive sectors.American analysts were struck by the aggressiveness of the Trump team’s demands. Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the hard-nosed approach “makes it harder to envision a path toward a negotiated settlement.”Keep an eye on article changes when you hit F5 Refresh folks :pThere’s a lot of human garbage in the US Government and, of course, the US News Entertainment industry.Additional Commentary: This is especially frustrating because China is an excellent partner for win win projects in the US.Example: A large apartment family friendly integrated complex housing at least 220 Residential Tenants and at least 12 Commercial Tenants in a heart of a city with room for expansion with a combination team of Architects and specialist Engineers from China and local Americans working together with custom made parts & materials from Chinese suppliers with the bulk of the denser heavier concrete/rebar/lumber from US suppliers that is put together by majority American labor. Project Managers include both Chinese and local Americans with the end product being a convenient community where you can live, play, hang out at Cafes, shop for fresh seafood and bakery, park your cars, charge the EVs and keep a full staff of American workers employed everyday to maintain the building and handle administrative duties.That’s win win and is made possible by Chinese owner investors who are willing to commit for the long term and don’t feel like they are being made out as the enemy.

It is not an exaggeration Bechtel can build entire cities, industrial complexes, and power grids from scratch.Fifty years ago, that was rather special, because Bechtel already had a CV that included the Hoover dam, and BART. In more recent years, Bechtel’s major projects include Boston’s Big Dig, and the Channel tunnel linking the UK with France.Pretty impressive, by any standard. If you have a difficult civil engineering project, Bechtel is the go-to contractor if you need been-there, done-that expertise. It has been the top U.S. contractor for 21 consecutive years, according to the ENR.How much revenue did the top U.S. contractor generate last year?About $25.5 billion.Now let’s cross the Pacific to China, a flight from first world to third to look at the Chinese competition.What’s China’s Bechtel?I would wager a bet very few have heard of this company:CSCEC, or the China State Construction Engineering Corporation.What was their revenue in 2019?1.2 trillion RMB, or $171 billion—almost 7 (yes, 7!) Bechtels worth of business.With a list of completed projects that include:The world’s first operational 3rd gen EPR nuclear power plant in Taishan.Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory 3.The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.The Guangzhou Opera House.The Xi’an Daming palace.The Shanghai World Financial Center.The $1.4 billion Wuhan railway station.The iconic CMG HQ in Beijing.The Macau Tower.The futuristic Baoan airport.The Haixia Olympic Center.The Chongqing International Convention and Exhibition Center.That is what one third world EPC is capable of, in terms of sheer scale and complexity.What’s my point?Fifty years ago, Bechtel was special, and operated in the rarefied air of exclusivity.Two decades into the new century, third world “upstarts” operate on way greater scale and have just-as-impressive references.The difference this time? They are significantly cheaper and faster while staying on-spec.Which is the same story you will find across the industrial spectrum. There may be few Chinese brands you’re aware of, but I bet there are numerous Chinese-made products in the average household, especially critical components of electronics found in everything from throwaway flashlights to the latest iphone.China has consistently delivered on-spec products at unbeatable prices and speed for decades. That is why she is the world’s factory—entirely on merit.I once asked an industry veteran why businesses are unable to resist the allure of China. He explained it wasn’t a matter of choice. If his competitor moves his factories to China, he has to follow suit or risk irrelevance within a decade. In other words, business models are turbocharged with Chinese production. Unless you have a niche market with moats and high walls, you die, even if you are brontosaurus size.All that talk about IP theft and forced tech transfers is way off base. The companies that went to China made decisions with their eyes wide open. They caught the prevailing wind which blew them into China’s embrace. In fact, many couldn’t wait to get in bed with the Chinese after catching wind of their competitors’ bottomline post-China.Notice the elevated proportion of those 25–34? That translates into tens of millions jobs that won’t be filled by those coming after them (the 10–24).Notice the elevated proportion of those 25–34? That translates into tens of millions jobs that won’t be filled by those coming after them (the 10–24).China is facing a labor crunch in the coming decade. Thankfully, it is not a nightmare because China is now at $10,000 GDP per capita, firmly third world. Which means there are plenty of third world jobs in the economy. Like assembling iphones. Or making plastic flowers. What the demographics tell us is older factories making low-margin goods will find it difficult to replace labor in the tight market, and fade into obsolescence.

See, they are trying to hide things from our Free Press!” And despite being profoundly illogical and impractical, some people (overwhelming among the English-speakers, and not among the German, French, and Italian-speakers), to this day, still believe this urban legend. I find this shocking.Let me ask you this question: have you heard of theCountries in Asia basically use it to make their own government budget, and Chambers of Commerce, from Sweden to Australia, will all pick up the useful bits and immediately send pamphlets to their business communities: “China is going to do this. Opportunity for us to make money!” That’s how “secret” it is.Now let’s take a look at the 12th five-year-plan (2011 - 2015) as an example. The plan set the following targets:Great. How do you think this can be done in secret? Hundreds of millions of people have this as their “to-do list” for this five years!The same with the “Made in China 2025”. It IS PART OF THE 13TH FIVE-YEAR-PLAN. Hundreds of millions of people have this on their own “to-do list” from now till 2025. Tens of thousands of organizations are involved. Every level of the Chinese government has this on their performance review form. The official Chinese government newspaper, People’s Daily, which is public with 3 million subscribers, praise those who get their jobs done, and criticize those who fail badly, on a daily basis. It’s called “using public shaming to drive behavior”. So how exactly can you keep all this secret, while still get 1.4 billion Chinese citizens to work together towards the common goals?It’s not possible. And this is why the Chinese government has never, ever, kept its public policies “secret”. Not since Day One of the founding of PRC. It’s not about “is it more beneficial to keep the plan secret”. It’s that to reach a common goal, hundreds of millions of people have to work together towards it by necessity. If you keep it secret, who’s going to get it done? You?

Due to disparate devices and sensors from arrange of vendors, the information remains discrete and as a result,the IoT landscape looks fragmented. Engaging different devices and applications may help businesses make the most of the data available and generate deep insights. But to handle such complexities, a business needs to have a platform that allows application development, device monitoring and data management.

Whether it’s tIoT and Bigdata have come a long way in no time and the technological implementations of these concept too have been able to show that these are the future technologies that would bring the entire world together.The Internet of Things (IoT) has the power to change our world. And while we are starting to see its incredible impact, we are still very much at the beginning of the transformation journey. Soon every device you own – and nearly every object you can imagine – will be connected to the Internet. Whether it’s through your phone, wearable tech or everyday household objects, the Internet of Things (IoT) will connect us in ways we can’t even imagine yet.The Internet of Things represents devices, buildings, vehicles and more with sensors, software and network connectivity built into them. These things are connected to the Internet and to each other transmitting data and information to the people who use them.As you can imagine, life in ten years will look materially different from how it looks in 2017 as the pace of technology change accelerates, thanks in large part to the coming boom of the Internet of Things.According to Gartner, Inc., there were more connected devices than people in 2008 and in the next few years that number will rise past 20 billion.Self-transportationSensors, software and connectivity have changed vehicle technology with one of the most excited innovations being the self-driving car.These let the vehicle automatically drive on open roads and in traffic. Connected software inside the car sends information back to engineers, which helps programmers make upgrades that make the cars safer and more efficient.The hope for self-driving cars is to prevent accidents and traffic-related deaths, save time for commuters, relieve traffic jams and save money on fuel and lost productivity.ManufacturingConnected devices are being used in manufacturing to cut costs and increased efficiency and productivity.HealthcareWearable technology and fitness trackers have already proven to be a huge healthcare market. These smart devices allow people to take an active role in their health management.CommunicationCommunication is one of the main areas in which the Internet of things is having many positive effects. Mobile and wearable devices are able to talk to each other by sending data to other devices, thus everyday communication and syncing personal information between devices has become easier.EnergySaving energy is a goal of high importance as the population continues to increase and natural resources diminish. The concept of the Smart Grid refers to an electrical grid equipped with digital technology that allows for communication between the utility and the costumers through connected devices such as thermostats, gas meters and other appliances. This way power can be drawn at times when power is not in high demand and therefore cheaper.AgricultureThe Internet of things is having an impact on the farming industry as well. John Deere machines have sensors that collect data on air and soil temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation and rainfall while smart watering systems save water by detecting leaks and watering only the most needed places in the fields. Sensors are being used to detect pests capable of destroying crops, which reduces the frequency and use of pesticides.Smart HomesOne of the most common ways the Internet of things is changing our lives is in our homes. Thermostats, alarm systems, smoke detectors, refrigerator, lighting and entertainment systems and even the doorbell can be connected, controlled and monitored from a mobile device.LogisticsEliminating waste and pollutants is a benefit of the union of logistics and the Internet of things. Video sensor-embedded stoplights adjust their green and red lights according to the time of day and the positions of cars. This reduces congestion, smog and idling vehicles, which accounts for around 17 percent of fuel consumption in urban areas.While these connected technologies take aWith the entire world connected, rises the concern for need for bigger data storage and also the protocols to be able to manage the large amount of data because we are talking about laying the entire world into data sets.In simple terms,If i were to put this in a simpler way:“IoT is the senses, Big Data is the fuel, and artificial Intelligence is the brain to realize the future of a smart connected world.”The end goal is to harness the data coming from sensors(or devices connected to internet) and other contextual information to discover patterns and correlations in real-time to positively impact the usage of the available information provided by IoT. Existing Big Data technologies need to be augmented to effectively store, manage and extract value from continuous streams of incoming data from the internet.Though Big Data tools promise security over large data sets, its not able to keep up with the required standard yet. With respect to the amount of data that goes over the internet through millions of computers/and other devices connected together globally, the security concerns have been major. In the coming years we can definitely expect to be able to narrow the pipeline for error and expect IoT alongwith Big Data to have more prominence in our life and make it easier to connect with each other and remove boundaries that have existed for centuries. The Internet of things continues to rapidly evolve and our everyday lives are along for the ride.","83,116 followers",Anna Sharudenko,9.9K,199,26.9M,4.0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

Sleep 8 Hours a NightNo ‘ifs’, ‘and’s’, or ‘buts’, you must get 8 hours of HIGH quality sleep everynight if you want to have the best life possible.Sure, you might sacrifice a few hours of productivity, however, if you look at any credible study, the research clearly shows that (unless you have a rare DEC2 genetic mutation) you need 5 sleep cycles to perform at your best.Sleep cycles occur every 90 minutes and, since it takes the average person 20 minutes to fall asleep, going to bed 8 hours before you need to be awake is ideal for optimal performance.5 Sleep Cycles x 90 Minutes = 7.5 Hours + 20 Minutes to Fall Asleep = 7 Hours 50 Minutes + 10 Minute buffer = 8 hours2. Make Sure You Sleep WELLJust because you are sleeping 8 hours doesn’t mean that you are getting 8 hours of quality sleep.To ensure that you are maximizing your “Z’s” I suggest that you:3. Exercise DailyThis might seem a little cliche, but it’s the single most important habit to ensure a high quality of life.If I don’t exercise daily (typically by lifting weights, doing yoga, or riding my bike), I can tell.I’m tired, ornery, and generally a bastard to be around.You need to get exercise as frequently as possible.Your body evolved to move so MOVE baby MOVE!4. MeditateAgain, this is cliche but it works.Taking 10 minutes every morning to sit in silence and simply reconnect with my breath and body has done miracles for my quality of life.Meditation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress, promote empathy, spark creativity, and improve overall well being tremendously.5. LaughThis is a big one that people often forget about.Laughter truly is the best medicine and starting out your mornings with a short stand-up comedy or a few clips from a funny talk show can put you into a positive mood that will permeate the rest of your day.I recommend that you find 2–3 comedians that you really love and purchase all of their stand-ups.Then, when you are cooking breakfast, play the show in the background and let the laughter roll.Oh, speaking of breakfast6. Eat BreakfastSeriously, I know a lot of you are probably avid practitioners of Intermittent Fasting, and that’s great, but unless you are counting calories and know for a fact that you are still getting enough fuel despite your fasting, you need to eat breakfast.It will charge you up for the rest of the day and prevent early afternoon “Hangriness”.7. Get Out in Nature (Preferably Near a Large Body of Water)Getting out in nature has been shown time and time again to be a HUGE factor in a person’s overall happiness and well being.We’ve evolved over the past 6,000 years to be surrounded by nature, not concrete.Make it a priority to get out in nature for at least 30 minutes a day.You won’t regret it.8. Connect with Someone You Love Every DayThis is a simple habit that will instantly and dramatically improve your quality of life.Humans are inherently social creatures and, despite the massive technological advancements we’ve recently experienced, we are more disconnected and solitary than ever before.Everyday I challenge you to connect with someone you love.Whether you Skype your mom, sit down for coffee with your girlfriend, or go hang out with amigos at the bar, spend at least 10 hours a week really connecting with people that you care about.9. Express GratitudeEvery single day ask yourself the question, “What do I have to be grateful for?”If you answer that question each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep, I promise your life will change forever.10. RelaxDo something fun everyday.Play guitar, play video games, read a good book, walk by the beach.Just do something that will make you happy and help you relax.Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you for it.Stay Grounded,Learn more about my work and mission by visiting my Quora profile",UNKNOWN,Qiaochu Yuan,2.9K,310,4.3M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

I will point out some instances where you can see the advantage of a common man's life. First of all, the main advantage of a common man is privacy and freedom. We all wish to have privacy rather than being surrounded by paparazzis. A common man can do many things that a celebrity can't do. For example, if a celebrity walks down a road they will be surrounded by people taking pictures asking for autographs etc. Even if they don't like being surrounded by people they can't be rude to them because it would affect their celebrity status. On the other hand a common man does not have these problems he would barely be noticed by anyone. We all like to go to different restaurants and try different dishes. But a celebrity can't do this mainly because of privacy issues, security reasons etc. They can't eat roadside foods even if they wish to have cause they would be surrounded by people taking pictures of them and it will become a big news which is annoying.They would be noticed everywhere they go. They can't go to a bar, a beach, a supermarket, a theatre etc. Every part of their lives would be known by the public which is very disturbing. They can't go on a road trip and enjoy like a common man because people like us surround them. In other words a common man's life is ruled by him or lived according to him, but a celebrity is sometimes controlled by the public.But this doesn't mean that all of this is impossible for a celebrity but the problem is lack of privacy, security reasons etc. Another thing is social media attacks. They face many attacks like provoking comments or rumours about them but a normal man can stay peacefully and doesn't have to worry about all these things. We have seen many celebrity suicides. Some celebrities have accepted that they have been in depression by the celebrity life. Some celebrities said that they hated the celebrity life and wished they got back the normal life. Justin Bieber once said that he becomes depressed while being in the hotel room because he can't go out and take a walk because he will be surrounded by paparazzis. Everywhere they go they will be surrounded by people asking for pictures, autographs etc. Justin Bieber said that he won't be taking pictures with people anymore and if u see him somewhere don't come asking for a picture. He says people treat him like a Zoo animal and he don't owe everybody a picture. Daniel Craig once said that he wanted to shout at people taking pictures of him having food at a restaurant but he can't do it. But celebrity life has many advantages too. Most of the celebrities are very rich and they can enjoy all the luxuries of life. The money earned by a common man in his lifetime can be earned by a celebrity at a young age. They get special privileges and they are respected by people wherever they go which a normal person doesn't get. They are role models to many people even a sentence they say can inspire many people. And when they die they would be remembered by everyone but it's opposite in the case of a common man.On conclusion, its the way you see things. This was my opinion but if you wish to have a celebrity life then go for it. Both the sides have advantages and disadvantages. Try to be happy in life as life is too short even if you are a normal person or a celebrity. And we all should understand the fact that we don't take anything with us when we die. So try to live life to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it even if you are a celebrity or a normal person.",264 followers,Surojit Mahato,3.3K,0,0,11.0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

At times, I would go without eating for days.Never in my life had I felt that miserable before.The worst part was that I was away from my family. Having lost interest in everything, and with no one to share my feelings with, I felt helpless. I was stuck in a vicious circle.Unable to take it anymore, I reached out for help.

Twenty-five years ago, we didn’t even have a word for “M2M” or “IoT”. We developed Machine to Machine devices without knowing that decades later these creations would be called “M2M devices”. Twenty-five years ago, the GSM network for wireless data communication did not exist. I took my first steps in wireless data communication with Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) on Private Mobile Radios (PMR). On PMRs we achieved communication speeds of 3600 bits per second. A little later we started using public analogue trunked radios. These trunked radio systems provided local terrestrial wireless networks on FSK. Years ago, the last public analogue trunked radio network in Germany was taken out of service. GSM jumped in with its Short Message Service (SMS) and Circuit Switched Data (CSD). CSD provided us 9600 bits per second. We could use SMS and CSD for straightforward countrywide data communication. Later on, GSM roaming offered us worldwide data communication. Today, GSM/GPRS is being gradually phased out and is being replaced by 3G and 4G technology. .....What has happened in those 20 years?GPSMany GPS modules still list 21 mA to 35 mA in the data sheet. 5 mA at Full tracking is already more than 80 % lower than other modules in the GPS market. Let’s see what will happen in the next 20 years. Perhaps Europe will have to be Galileo. :-)GSM20 years ago the power consumption was 20 mA. A while later we moved to 5 mA. Today we reached estimated 1 mA. The current peaks have shrunk from 2,5 Ampere to 1,8 Ampere. The end result is a much longer standby time on battery than two decades ago. GSM / GPS trackers profit from the lower power consumption in both wireless technologies. They have become smaller and smaller and the standby time is much longer today.MyselfThe finished IoT M2M Cookbook is a living work, because I plan to offer updates. Some updates are triggered by consulting projects; other updates are triggered by questions from readers or customers of wireless modules and antennas.  The third reason for updates is LTE. In US we will get a sunset of GSM. AT&T will go ahead with UMTS (HSPA/WCDMA) only. In Europe Swisscom in Switzerland will sunset GSM and replace it with LTE and UMTS. LTE has already a chapter in my book. However, in summer 2014 there were not a lot of details about LTE-M, LTE-MTC, NB-LTE and further LTE topics in the public domain. It is still not clear which cellular operator will install which LTE technology. LTE is a patchwork of more than 40 frequency bands across the world and no LTE module will be able to cover all bands. We will have LTE modules with selected bands for regions.The FutureAs long as I write cookbooks, recipes and consulting I do not plan to retire. I love to share my knowledge and experience and I am always glad if some electronic engineers with no or less experience in radios and antennas move within a few months from an idea to a prototype and later on to mass production.And if you have a need for wireless modules, antennas, consulting or development for your IoT M2M application, then to not hesitate to drop an email to harald.naumann (at) gsm - modem .de.

IoT gets its name for it is a convergence of multiple technologies, such as real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. All the data that is collected is stored on cloud and then secured. Machine learning and data analytics then comes into play, which can then make even a ‘dumb’ device ‘intelligent’.Apart from home automation or ‘smart homes’ as they are popularly known, Internet of Things has various use cases in the following areas:HealthcareLogisticsAgricultureManufactureIoT can also be used for traffic management, environmental monitoring and even disaster management to predict earthquakes, forest fires and Tsunamis.Challenges Faced While Implementing IoTAlthough IoT has numerous applications, it doesn’t come without challenges. Data privacy and security are major concerns when it comes to IoT. To clean, process and interpret the vast amount of data and to store this data in a secured manner is a major task for IoT applications especially in a country like India. Security is the biggest concern in adopting IoT. Cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat with the advent Internet of things. Legacy infrastructure is another issue that arises when it comes to IoT, as patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices. There is also a lack of a clear business model when it comes to IoT, which is hindering the implementation of IoT on a large scale.","135,257 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.3M,18.0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own. They need your help.","26,866 followers",Rohit Malshe,1.3K,327,11.4M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Internet-of-things-and-machine-learning-and-which-one-should-I-learn-first

How indeed does one prepare oneself for a (research or otherwise) career in machine learning, in particular in terms of familiarizing oneself with the underlying mathematics? I’m going to resist the temptation of trotting out some standard books, and instead, focus on giving broad advice.There’s some bad news on this front, and it’s best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more.

The latter is the study of fundamental laws of the universe, of matter, of conservation of energy and symmetry etc. The former engineering fields are attempts to build structures, gadgets, machines that build on the deep knowledge of the universe that physics gives us. It is laughable to think that we could have computers without the deep knowledge of material science that came from physics, particularly quantum mechanics. It was quantum theory that was used by the pioneering Bell Lab scientists in their first development of the transistor, a solid state switching device that was far superior to the older vacuum tube device. Without quantum mechanics, transistors could never have been developed. The N-P-N junction can only be explained by quantum effects, since it requires understanding how “holes” (gaps where electrons resided) could move across junctions.Similarly, statistics is the science that underlies the modern effort to build “learning machines”, or machine learning. Statistics is the original data science, and it is somewhat ironic that ML researchers have wrapped themselves in this cloak of “data science”. Statisticians, for over a hundred years, have labored mightily to build the principles of data science. The deepest and most beautiful theorems in data science come not from machine learning, but from statistics.Take the beautiful concept of “sufficient statistics”. What can you abstract from raw data so that you retain all the knowledge necessary about the generative model that can “explain” the data. The famous Rao-Blackwell theorem is an example of such a deep theorem, which can guide the design of powerful machine learning systems (and has done so, for decades).Trying to do ML without knowing statistics is like to trying to build engineering structures without physics. You can certainly succeed in some ways — after all, the Egyptians built the pyramids — but it will be a risky trial and error exercise, possibly costing thousands of lives in costly mistakes. Science allows the engineer to construct safe designs, solutions that can be tested in simulation, and built reliably (such as the latest skyscraper in San Francisco, the new SalesForce building that has been extensively tested to withstand the next earthquake, whenever that happens).","3,905 followers",Monica Anderson,806,148,1M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Internet-of-things-and-machine-learning-and-which-one-should-I-learn-first

While your industry may not be as volatile or prone to change as the tech industry, technology driven change is coming to your industry via new products and services enabled by theRecently, in the world of technology, there has been a substantial buzz about the Internet of Things and you should pay attention too. Experts and researchers agree the Internet of Things will bring significant change to both your personal and professional lives in the years to come. The tech stack that powers the internet of things — or Thing Stack as we like to call it — enables your company to create new products and services, which help you differentiate your offerings from competitors.What is the Internet of Things?The Internet of Things refers to a network of internet-connected objects like vehicles, devices and buildings. Objects are embedded with sensors and electronics to allow them to both collect and transfer information to your cloud database. The Internet of Things allows objects produced by your company to be detected and controlled remotely via existing network infrastructure. This in turn creates the opportunity for a direct integration between your physical and digital worlds. Automated IoT systems gather, report and crunch your data faster and more accurately than humans who manually gather and enter information into your database. The end result is a system that provides value to your company in new and exciting ways.IoTWhat is a technology stack?Traditionally, the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates after frameworks, languages, protocols and standards are defined. Each layer in a technology stack needs to integrate and communicate with the other layers of the stack. As a tech stack matures, it becomes easier and less expensive for your developers — if you have them — to create new products and services.The IoT stack is rapidly developing and maturing into the Thing Stack. This Thing Stack consists of three technology layers: sensors, microcontrollers and internet connectivity, and service platforms.New solutions, choices, and technologies are developing and emerging rapidly in each of the three layers because use cases differ based on industry, price point, object size, processor speed, power requirements and networking constraints. For example, a utility application intended to monitor a smart meter doesn't have the same connectivity requirements as a healthcare application designed to monitor a patient's heart rate.Your enterprise IoT application designer reviews your use cases, device requirements and existing data to better understand how to create value. By better understanding each layer of the Thinks Stack, you make better decisions about the technologies you should use for your IoT product.Layer 1: SensorsSensors have been used for years in a number of different industry contexts like healthcare, aviation, manufacturing and automotive. Now, sensors are so tiny and inexpensive they can be embedded in all the devices you use personally and professionally. The sensor layer of the IoT tech stack continues to expand as internet connected sensors are added to new products and services.Besides incorporating sensors into your smartphones and tablets, your innovative competitors are introducing new devices that contain numerous sensors. These sensors don't need to be connected directly to the internet and they sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth LE to send captured data to the cloud. For example, Sensordrone is a Kickstarter project that embeds many environmental sensors into a small dongle. Some of the environmental sensors include color intensity, humidity, gas, and pressure sensors. The dongle collects information about your physical environment and sends this information to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. This example demonstrates how value can be created by new services that use sensors to gather new types of data from your physical environment.Another category of sensors are embedded in watches, contact lenses, wristbands, and fabrics. Recently, Nokia patented a technique for magnetic tattoos that vibrate from incoming messages or calls. This is possible by spray tattooing or stamping a material onto your skin. The material is then paired with a smartphone or tablet, which lets you interact with the sensor. Microsoft and University of Washington researchers are working on another way to connect sensors to your body through the use of IoT contact lenses that provide real-time updates about the biochemical fluctuations in your body. One use case is to help diabetes patients monitor their insulin levels while using these contact lenses.Layer 2: Microcontrollers and internet connectivityThe second layer in the Internet of Things technology stack allows for local storage, data processing and internet connectivity. The Internet of Things needs internet connectivity to send collected data to your cloud database. Because some sensors generate over 10,000 data points per second, it makes sense to pre-process data locally before sending it to your cloud database. By analyzing, extracting and summarizing your collected data before you send it to your cloud database, you reduce the volume of unnecessary data you send to and store on your cloud database, saving you money on data transfer and storage costs.Your microcontroller is a small computer embedded within a chip and it helps your IoT device store and pre-process collected data before it's synced to your cloud database. Your microcontroller possesses a processor, a small amount of RAM to hold data, some kilobytes of EPROM or flash memory to hold embedded software, and solid-date memory to cache data.In some cases, your IoT device may need to use programmable microcontrollers to take action and turn something on or off. In most cases, these decisions are made via a cloud application, but it makes sense to use programmable microcontrollers when a sensor detects something that could affect the health and safety of your end customers.The main and most important capability of this layer is networking, which is either wireless or wired. If a device is stationary and can access an external power source, a wired network is sufficient, but a wired network doesn't make sense for many IoT use cases because physical cables are needed to connect to the network. WiFi, wireless modems, and wireless mesh networks are the most common ways IoT devices are connected to the internet.If you plan to manufacture an IoT device you must keep in mind dependencies for your use cases. Is your device mobile or fixed? Does your device need a battery or is it connected to a fixed power supply? How much data do you need to transfer to your cloud database per hour? Should your device's connectivity be episodic or continuous?Devices you use to track your health and fitness while bicycling, running, and exercising store data while you're active, and these devices use episodic connectivity. Your device then syncs with the cloud when it's close to your smartphone or tablet. Compare this to the continuous connectivity needed by Amazon Echo's voice based digital assistant who is always listening for your commands, fetching answers from the internet the instant you ask a question. Depending on your IoT product's use cases, you may need continuous connectivity.When you research Think Stack vendors, you'll notice a wide range of different networking protocols, hardware, software, and architectures are used to build IoT products. Due to the variation in use cases and environments, you have many choices when it comes to adding networking and computing capabilities your IoT device. While some vendors focus more on hardware components, other vendors provide a system of integrated software and hardware. Sometimes, IoT software solutions spill into the third layer of the Thing Stack, which is referred to as the service platform.Layer 3: Service platformsThe first two layers for the Thing Stack embed sensor and microcomputers in your IoT device, but your IoT product profits from the service platform layer. This layer delivers value to your customers by automating processes and delivering rich data analytics. Your cloud application combines data collected from numerous IoT sensors with your (or your customers) other business data to produce insights that generate business value.It's important for your service platform to create a feedback loop between your IoT devices and you device management software, so you and your customers can upgrade, monitor, and maintain the firmware on each the device. In most cases, service platforms operate on cloud infrastructure and utilize a multi-tenant software architecture to deliver a seamless software-as-a-service (SaaS) experience.The convergence between our digital and physical worlds stresses your IT operations by increasing demand for data management, storage, tagging and analysis. It's in your company's best interests to build your IoT service platform on robust cloud infrastructure, so you can scale infinitely as your business grows with your new IoT product.While ""software is eating the world"" as Marc Andreessen said, consumers and companies still purchase a lot of physical things. If you build a robust IoT service platform, you obtain insights about how your customers use your IoT products and services. With a great IoT service platform you can manage post-transaction relationships in new and engaging ways.Because service platforms store and make decisions based on data collected from all types of IoT devices, they are often considered the backbone of post-transactions relationships. What if you reached out to customers who never powered on your IoT device and proactively on-boarded them? What if you used anonymized data from customers getting the most value out of your product to help other customers unlock more business value?Now is the time to build your IoT product because sensors keep getting smaller and network connectivity solutions keep getting better. Create a plan to engage with your customers and facilitate goal-oriented post-transaction relationships, leading to new opportunities to turn a single transaction into a strong relationship.How to extract value from the Thing Stack?The Thing Stack isn't just for emerging companies or technology companies. The Thing Stack will revolutionize your industry and create efficiencies and new products your customers love. With end-to-end IoT solutions, you can now redefine your relationship customers and create new data-driven goal oriented outcomes. When you can measure everything, you can identify problems your customers have early and intervene to create positive outcomes.Now that you understand the Thing Stack, it's up to you to create an IoT product that changes the way you interact with your customers.","37,422 followers",Xavier Amatriain,629,297,8.4M,9.0,https://www.quora.com/What-platform-will-Internet-of-Things-software-be-built-on

Tracking, monitoring, and real-time alerting are now possible, allowing clinicians to intervene more quickly, make more accurate decisions, and provide better service. Consider the following scenario: If you wanted to check your blood pressure, heart rate, or blood sugar level 25 years ago, you had to go to the doctor. You can now check it multiple times a day on your smart devices! Remote monitoring after medical treatment can help to prevent readmissions.IoT in healthcare saves time and effort while also lowering expenses for patients. For example, real-time patient monitoring reduces the frequency of hospital visits a patient must make.Even the most efficient hospital personnel are prone to errors. Exhausted healthcare staff, for example, are more likely to make mistakes, but a device cannot become tired, minimizing the risk of error.Large amounts of data must be stored in hospitals. It takes a lot of time, effort, and space to do it manually. IoT-enabled gadgets, on the other hand, automatically gather, analyze, and store data on the cloud, making it easy for patients and clinicians to share information.Through interoperability, patient data transfer, and information interchange between departments or hospitals, IoT enables automation of patient workflows to the point where different connectivity protocols assist detect indicators of illness early.Hope you will find this answer useful!","220,217 followers",Franklin Veaux,10.5K,47.3K,779.7M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-internet-of-things-impact-health-care

On the other hand, because of user privacy issues on IoT computers, IT security professionals think that it is dangerous.In 2017 nearly half of all U.S. businesses using IoT apps were affected by a security breach, according to findings from the recently concluded Altman Vilandrie & Company Survey of 397 IT executives across 19 industries. And the expense of these breaches was between hundreds of thousands and tens of millions of dollars.Whether it's the huge array of documents and files released in mark 2017 by Wikileaks that reveal CIA Hacking Tools, which shows the agency's ability to spy out IoT security challenges with an unflattering headline, on smartphones, computer operating systems, message applications and Internet connected television.Here are The 10 Best IoT Security Solutions for IoT Security Issues :1- IoT network securityThe network of IoT-based devices linked to backend networks on the Internet is protected and managed by the introduction of the standard endpoint security functions such as anti-virus, firewalls and firewalls.2- IoT Device AuthenticationLet users authenticate IoT devices with several operating functions for the individual IoT device and with robust authentication mechanisms such as double-factor authentication, digital certifications and biometrics.3- IoT Data EncryptionSecure the user privacy and avoid IoT-data loss, by using standard cryptographic algorithms and completely encrypted, lifecycle management processes to improve general protection of user data and privacy, encrypt data at rest and during transit between IoT devices and back-end systems.4 – Security methods for IoT PKIUsing IoT public key authentication methods such as digital Certificate X.509, cryptographical key and life-cycle capabilities including public / private key creation, delivery, management and revocation in order to ensure a safe link between an iOT system & app.5 – IoT Security AnalyticsUsing IoT security analytics tools which can detect attacks and intrusions unique to IoT that can not be detected by conventional network protection tools such as firewalls.6-Using IoT API Protection methods not only to protect the data integrity movement across IoT devices, back-end systems, and application systems using a recorded REST-based API, but also to ensure that APIs are only shared by approved devices, developers and applications, and that potentially threatened and attacked by unique APIs are detected.7- IoT Hardware TestingTo ensure the safety of IoT hardware, establish a robust test framework. This involves a comprehensive test of the range, capability and latency of the IoT system. The IoT device chip producers must also strengthen the processors to increase safety and power consumption without making it too costly for buyers.8- Secured IoT Apps DevelopmentGiven the immaturity of the current IoT technology, IoT applications developers will emphasize their IoT applications' safety aspect strictly through the implementation of all of the IoT protection technologies. Before IT applications are developed.9- Avoid Rushing The Launching of IoT systemsThe makers of IoT devices are always in a rush to sell their goods at the lowest cost, to remain ahead of the competition. And they don't pay adequate attention to delivering security updates and fixes when doing so. It poses a serious long-term threat to the health of your IoT apps.10 – Concern for Threats and Breaches of IoT SecurityDevice makers and software developers must be cautious about the current IoT security threats and infringements to guarantee the protection of IoT apps and applications. Since IoT is still a new technology, its safety breaches are expected to occur. Therefore, in the event of safety attack or data infringement, both IoT product companies and IoT app developer must be prepared for security infringement with an adequate escape strategy in order to ensure maximum data.

Here, that would be considered witchcraft, and in the words of one of the greatest African Kings from the neighboring Wakanda kingdom, “No, We don't do that here”.Anyway, I digress. I would like to know more about this Internet you speak of. Does it fetch firewood? Can I use it to get myself a bride from the lakeside with a derriere from here to Timbuktu? (*see footnote) Does it walk, talk or breathe or is it a thing like a calabas? I've heard rumors that the Internet connects people from different lands and they don't have to travel so far to get water and sell their cattle. However, I choose to dispel these fork tales. You wonder why? See, these red-skinned people have been telling my folks and other people's folks that they need to close their eyes to connect with their god. However, people who did this found themselves closing their eyes and when they opened them, their land was gone. But they have also brought good stuff like more refined palm wine in gourds that one can see through. This means that Uncle Kamau with his banana wine drinking problem can no longer take big sips of wine from my gourd without me noticing because I can use my eyes to measure. So to answer your question, Kenya does not have Internet. Next time you come here, kindly bring me some.Since we use smoke signals and drums to communicate here, here's how you reach me. Just come all the way to the great junction of Makutano and when you're there, proceed North East till you pass the great plains of Mwea and when you start seeing hills, know that you're close to my home place. Find the tallest hill you can and light a fire. Release seven tufts of smoke, take a break, release another one tuft, beat your drum five times and then release five other tufts of smoke. That is my smoke signal code and anyone that sees it will know that you're looking for me and bring you to my humble village known as Difathas. Here they call me Don Difatha which when loosely translated to red skin language means, “Godfather of all the Fathers”.I will be waiting for more information about this Internet thing. I must educate my people.Footnote: The Timbuktu are our far away neighbors from the West. These guys can really travel long distances just to sell salt.

An IoT device is nothing more than a device that has integrated sensors to collect information, and connectivity to communicate this information. Turns out that actually creating operational intelligence is not that easy.Far too often, both the general public and companies who engage with smart technology conflate the term “IoT” with something else altogether: embedded intelligence.Embedded intelligence and IoT are not the same technology. And by conflating them, consumers can end up disappointed by their tech, and companies can find themselves spending money on “solutions” that don’t really solve any problems.Here’s the difference between the two—and why it pays to know which is which:When customers ask for smart devices, vendors sell them IoT devices.IoT devices work by continually monitoring something—heart rate, speed, temperature, etc.—and communicating this information to a data collection service, typically running in the cloud.That data can then be used to optimize operational aspects of the asset (a human trying to sleep better, for instance). But IoT devicesEmbedded intelligence is different. When we give an object embedded intelligence, we’re giving it the ability to change something or make a decision in real time, at the source of the data collection. Sleep trackers use IoT tech because they simply monitor how well or how poorly you sleep. They do not exhibit embedded intelligence as they don’t adjust the firmness of your mattress or gently fluff your pillow in response to the data they collect.Making local decisions to create a “smart” device is the purview of automation and has a long history. For example, you can find a very simple form of embedded intelligence in the governor on a steam engine. As the engine speeds up, the governor begins to spin. As the centrifugal force increases, the flywheels on the governor rise and limit the amount of steam that can reach the cylinders in the engine, keeping it from overheating. As the engine slows, the flywheel comes down, allowing more steam to reach the cylinders. Essentially, the governor is reacting as the situation changes, making a “decision” about how much steam to allow into the cylinders.Today, embedded intelligence is much more capable as the cost of sensors and processing capability has gone down, making it possible to collect and analyze vasts amounts of information, but the principle is the same. A change or decision is being made on the fly, at the source of the data.The value difference between IoT and embedded intelligence:Let’s take an autonomous car as an example. The ability to act on the sensor data to facilitate autonomous driving is an example of embedded intelligence, and it creates a completely new product category. Sending this same sensor data to an IoT data collection service would only increase the cost of the product, and provide no value-add. However, if we send acoustic, suspension, or engine performance data that holds information about the mechanical performance of the car and its components, an IoT service could provide value-add through prognostics to generate predictive maintenance alerts.Embedded intelligence is about acting on the here-and-now to create new product categories. IoT is about data collection and analysis to discover the behavior and characteristics of the device, and the collective intelligence that can be generated when looking at thousands or millions of these devices in unison.In short, IoT approaches are vast undertakings that require careful planning and follow-through. Value will not be created until the effort crosses a threshold of sufficient scale and complexity.Going back to the sleep tracker, the current state of that effort hasn’t crossed that complexity threshold yet, and thus no value is being created.Embedded intelligence and IoT are both data-driven endeavors—but they work at very different scales. Both require deep insights in the mathematical models that accurately describe the operations of the device, but the goal of embedded intelligence is to condense this insight into immediate action at the device, whereas IoT needs to condense that insight across the collective of devices.Ultimately, conflating IoT and embedded intelligence isn't just inaccurate—it's costly, time-consuming, and not likely to meet your customers' expectations.",0 followers,Tom Crosley,659,2.6K,22.9M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-Internet-of-Things-really-the-future

Many consumers buying these smart devices currently don't bother to hook them up to their WiFi, which means they're essentially offline and out of reach of hackers. But that may change as manufacturers continue to tout the benefits of connectivity. And the number of devices is expected to more than triple, to 75 billion, by 2025.The sheer number of vulnerable devices gives hackers powerful leverage. The Mirai attack of 2016, which may have been inspired by Cui's original paper, illustrates how dangerous the threat has grown. Paras Jha, a quiet, socially awkward college dropout from New Jersey, ran a lucrative business renting space on his own private computer server to fellow aficionados of the video-game Minecraft, so they could play privately with their friends. It sounds pleasant, but the business is cutthroat. A common tactic of Jha and his rivals was to hack into the home computers of unsuspecting people, hijack them with malware and instruct them to send torrents of unwanted messages and data to the machines of their rivals, overwhelming them and hopefully shutting them down—known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS). Unsuspecting customers, frustrated by the ""unreliable"" service, were then easy targets for poaching.In 2016, Jha and two Minecraft friends he'd met online decided to do his rivals one better. They hacked not only desktop computers but also the myriad security cameras, wireless routers, digital video recorders, household appliances, and other IoT devices. Like Cui before him, Jha and his friends wrote a program that scanned the internet to locate vulnerable devices. But unlike Cui, they actually planted malware on the machine and took control of them. Leveraged by the proliferation of smart devices, Jha's zombie bot army grew faster than he could have imagined--by the end of the first day, he had appropriated 65,000 devices; by some estimates, his zombie army reached 600,000.The attack, nicknamed ""Mirai"" (""the future"") after a Japanese television series, was so powerful that Jha wasn't content with taking down his small-fry Minecraft rivals. He also trained the new weapon on the huge French telecom provider OVH, which hosted a popular tool that his rivals relied on to defend themselves against his attacks. Eventually, the cops took notice. Jha was fined $8.6 million and 2,500 hours of community service working for the FBI.Many of the largest tech companies have invested heavily in tapping into the market for ""smart home"" devices, one of the fastest-growing areas for IoT devices. Amazon is among those dominating the market for smart hubs, along with Google, which purchased the digital thermostat maker Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion. Google has since expanded it to become a digital hub that also includes smoke detectors and security systems like smart doorbells and locks. Samsung has the SmartThings hub, which it acquired in 2014 for $200 million, and now connects to air conditioners, washers, and TVs. Apple has a home kit that can control any number of devices through voice commands delivered in a range of its HomePod.(Dave Limp, of Amazon devices and services, introduces the Echo Dot in 2018. GRANT HINDSLEY/AFP/GETTY)Gaping vulnerabilitiesOnce these systems are installed, devices from a growing number of companies can be added to the home network, including those made by well-known home appliance manufacturers like GE, Bosch, and Honeywell. Belkin makes a line of connected appliances that includes a Crock-Pot WeMo Smart Slow Cooker, smart Mr. Coffee maker and a smart home humidifier. There's a lot of money to be made. All told by the end of 2019, more than $490 billion in profits will have been earned on the nearly 2 billion consumer devices sold over the previous 12 months, according to the property management consulting firm iProperty Management.To try to draw attention to the dangers—and the things consumers should be asking questions about when buying new IoT products—Antonakakis and Alrawi, in collaboration with researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have developed a rating system and begun evaluating the security of a wide array of IoT devices. And surprisingly they found gaping vulnerabilities in devices and systems produced by even some of the most tech-savvy companies.The vulnerability of IoT devices goes well beyond holes in password protection, the vulnerability exposed by the Mirai attack, they argue. IoT devices can also be accessed and taken over directly through the home network they are connected to, and that home network is only as strong as its weakest link. That means that even if each device comes with a unique password and username, it's not necessarily secure. Once hackers find a way onto the home network through one vulnerable device, the path is often wide open to the rest of the network.To secure an IoT device, they argue, manufacturers need to patch vulnerabilities in four different areas : direct access to the device itself, the mobile app used to run it, the way it communicates with its home network and, in many cases, the cloud-based server that manufacturers use to push out updates, collect user data, or provide new services.Getting all that right is not easy. For a vendor to secure all four parts, Alrawi notes, it needs a good mobile-app developing team ""that knows secure development,"" a ""system team that does very good embedded system development and secure development"" and cloud experts who can design a secure cloud ""backend"" that allows the device to be managed without exposing it to additional risk. Finally, the device manufacturers need somebody who has network knowledge on how to build efficient and secure internet protocols and what protocols to avoid.""They have to balance all this with usability,"" he says ""So you can see that this is already getting really hard to manage just mentally. When a startup team that comes up with this great idea wants to push a product to market, they're usually a small team that doesn't have all this expertise. But even with big vendors, some of these problems are really hard to pin down and manage.""Indeed, while Antonakakis, Alrawi and their team give relatively high marks for device security to the mainstream products like the Amazon Echo and the Belkin Netcam, they gave them Cs, Ds, and Fs for network security—a measure of how protected these devices are from intruders who manage to access the home wireless network through other vulnerable devices. And while a number of devices associated with Google's Nest smart home products (like thermostats, smoke detectors, smart locks, and doorbells) receive As and Bs for device and network security, they got Cs and Ds for mobile and cloud protections—meaning a resourceful hacker intent on say, unlocking the front door, could still access a home.The cloud category is the most worrisome. Since many of these services are cloud-based and connected to central company servers, if a determined, well-financed hacker—say, China, North Korea or Russia—was to use the same kind of sophisticated exploits they have used to bypass security on the traditional internet of computers, there's no telling what they might do.""You're talking about getting access to potentially millions of people's homes, and when that happens, think about all of the microphones and cameras and actuators that you have around your house, and multiply that out by all the people who use these things,"" Cui says.""Many consumers don't fully understand the risks associated with installing some of these devices in their homes,"" adds Alrawi.Until they do, the situation is unlikely to change. Many experts wonder how big a price we will have to pay before that happens. ""It's a mess,"" says David Kennedy, a cybersecurity expert who designs security for a wide array of manufacturers and has testified before Congress on the IoT. ""An absolute mess. We're going into this very blind, without a lot of security discussions around what the impacts are going to be to our lives and to our safety.""Kennedy, whose current title is CEO of the company TrustedSec, has hacked into his share of devices over the years to make a point, including smart TVs, thermostats, smart fridges, robotic house cleaners and controllers that are connected to the energy grid. But Kennedy's biggest concern at the moment is in the area of automotive safety.There have already been some cautionary tales. In 2015, Fiat Chrysler had to issue a safety recall affecting 1.4 million vehicles in the United States so it could patch software vulnerabilities, after two security researchers hacked into the internet-connected entertainment system of a Jeep Cherokee carrying a magazine reporter, took control of the vehicle, blasted the radio and AC, then brought traffic to a standstill in the middle of a freeway.The problem, says Kennedy, is that most cars have scores of different pieces of technology in them, many of which are connected directly to the internet to allow them to transmit data needed for preventive maintenance. But the manufacture of these different IoT devices is often subcontracted out to scores of different contractors, which makes it logistically difficult to provide security updates and patches when new security vulnerabilities are discovered. (He pointed to Tesla as the major exception because, he argues, it is ""a software manufacturer first and car manufacturer second,"" and thus knows how to build secure systems.)The idea of regularly pushing out preventive security updates to patch newly discovered vulnerabilities in IoT-networked cars—a standard practice for products like Microsoft Windows and the Apple iPhone—is new and has not yet been incorporated into the automotive industry. ""I can't talk about which car manufacturers I've done assessment work for, but I can tell you that I've worked for a number of them, and security practices need a lot of work,"" he says. ""They're not pushing patches out to the cars, which makes them extremely vulnerable to specific attacks—everything from eavesdropping in your car to driving them off the road.""Online Break-ins Hackers could break into one device on a car or in a home and from there gain access to an entire network. Many toys are now linked to the internet. (ROBYN BECK/AFP/GETTY)The nightmare scenario is a mass fleet takeover, where a bad actor hacks different cars across the world to cause mass mayhem. ""That's definitely something that's possible now with these interconnected cars, no question about it,"" Kennedy says. ""Someone will lose their life and then eventually they'll kind of knee jerk into fixing the whole industry. I think that's what it will take to change the mentality of car manufacturers.""Lawmakers in some jurisdictions are beginning to wade into the murky waters of IoT regulation. In January, California will become the first state to implement an IoT security law. The bill, passed in 2018 with a January 2020 deadline, will require companies that make connected devices to equip them with ""reasonable security features,"" explicitly requiring that each device come with either a unique passcode or require the user to generate one before using the IoT device for the first time—taking aim at patching the vulnerability exploited so successfully in the Mirai exploit and the copycat attacks that have followed. Beyond that, however, the law seems to have been written to be purposely vague, allowing room for further state guidance in the future.Cybersecurity experts have called on the Federal government in the U.S. to step in to regulate the industry. The U.S. House of Representatives last March introduced a bill, for the third session in a row, that would require the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S. Department of Commerce to develop recommended standards for IoT devices, and would assign the Office of Management and Budget (OMB ) the task of issuing guidance to agencies that aligns with NIST's requirements. The law would also require NIST to offer guidance on vulnerability disclosure and report on IoT cybersecurity threats.Two and half years ago, NIST started a program to look at the issue and this past summer solicited public comment on a voluntary set of minimum ""baseline"" security functions that any internet-capable device should offer, whether it is intended for consumers, businesses or federal agencies, says Katerina ""Kat"" Megas NIST program manager, Cybersecurity for Internet of Things.Among them, every single device must have a unique number or identifier associated with it that shows up on the network, which would make it easy to locate quickly and unplug the source of any problems that arise—a feature that many IoT devices currently do not offer. Other features would manage access to each device through secure methods of user authentication; protect data by encrypting it; and provide security updates and log cyber-events so investigators can track how problems develop.Few experts have illusions these measures will solve the problem soon. The standards would be voluntary. And even if Congress were to enact laws mandating security standards, a profound security vulnerability would remain, users, themselves.""No matter how strong your system is, it's only as strong as your weakest link—and the weakest link is always the human,"" says Jason Glassberg, co-founder of Casaba Security, a leading cybersecurity firm. ""The largest breaches, the largest attacks, for the most part, have not been because of some super significantly technical attack. It's been because someone's been fooled into giving up their credentials. They've been fooled into clicking on a link that installed malware or asked them to provide their password. And it certainly doesn't change in the Internet of Things world.Ref:",46 followers,Ian Lang,4.3K,5.8K,64M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-useful-IoT-Internet-of-Things-devices-for-use-at-home

In response to the pandemic's economic downturn, spending will concentrate on safe and proven technologies. A variety of staff are likely to choose to start operating remotely as a result of the lock-down. This will encourage the growth of remote job optimisation technologies. Let us therefore look more closely at the technological developments in 2020 as they have a huge influence on information technology.The Internet of Things ( IoT), autonomous vehicles, extended realities, cloud computing, quantum, artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS – a service for companies who don't or can't build databases themselves and manage their own artificial intelligence systems), digital profiling / consume analytics, customized knowledge are included in many lists of technology developments for this some of the strategic technological trends it even becomes possible to divide into the groups people-centered (Hippometry, multi-experience, democratisation, human increase, transparency and traceability). and the trends of the intelligent spaces (Empowered Edge, Distributed Cloud, Self-support, Practical Blockchain, AI Security).I chose the trends that most frequently occur in the business and that are likely to shape the technology landscape by 2025.1. Artificial IntelligenceThe concept Artificial Intelligence ( AI) is not recent and still has greater influence in the world of information technology. AI typically refers to the application of algorithms using vast numbers of data to solve particular tasks in order to generalize and/or to measure other statistical estimates. These algorithms allow a machine, like a human brain, to 'behave.' 77% of customers now use AI technology , new applications emerge every day. In the year 2030, AI Technologies will make a contribution of more than $10.7 billion to the global economy, according to PwC research, one of the leading consultancies.In areas as online retail, health, telecommunications, banking , financial advice, insurance, dealerships and government the acceptance of the AI Chatbots by service is growing. Another of the chatbots is automation, which often simplifies work for workers (but does not shorten work as it is often found out). Within the AI trend, integrated AI and machine learning (AIaAS and MLaaS) can be described as sub-trends that include types such as bots and digital help, cognitive computing APIs, machine learning frameworks and machine learning services.The high costs of AI-based systems will lead to the use of service platforms for creating AI applications. They allow our own data to be fed and algorithms or compute resources to be paid for when using them. Amazon Web Services ( AWS), Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud are well known as AIaaS. Among other providers are AMS. Under the COVID-19, AI will contribute to predicting the needs of customers which are difficult to predict and enable enterprises to manage efficient logistics. under COVID-19. Chatbots will provide 24/7 assistance for customers, one of ""must have"" during lock-down. The use of machine learning will increase due to the need to improve algorithm moderators and visual materials in social networks (which often block accurate coronavirus information and do not detect fake news).2.

IoT will profoundly transform your user experience, offering previously un-possible opportunities. The pandemic will cause people to acquire this experience as they spend almost all of their time at home. IoT tools that boost quality of life and comfort in day-to-day life can become fashionable. Tele-medicine and IoT apps will increase their use to help track human health indicators.Security, lack of international quality standards and potential reduction in the use of manual duties are among the main threats to this trend. IoT allows good control and efficiency at the same time, saves money and time and can provide a better life experience. IoT sensors, analysis of data, traceability and monitor, connected production systems , smart supply chain management, intelligent barcode readers, smart grids, connected health care systems and smart farming are the best examples of IoT-based applications. The following are the best examples.3. CybersecurityAlong with emerging technological advancement and the rise of a variety of apps, there is an growing number of possible cyber threats. The primary objective of cyber attacks is typically to access, alter or kill sensitive information and theft of user money or to avoid normal business processes. Its frequency and complexity continue to increase. Such attacks. Computers, networks and cloud protection is typically supported by firewalls, DNS filtering, malware, antivirus software, and e-mail security solutions.For organizations whose business processes are focused on technology based on data, cybersecurity is a key trend. Security and data security have been paying much more attention since the General Data Protection Regulations of the European Union (GDRP) were signed. Phishing, ransomware, cryptojacking, cyber physical attacks, state-sponsored attacks and IoT attacks are the latest cybersecurity threats. Data failure is the biggest concern for cybersecurity and the black market is still pretty lucrative in the trade in personal information. According to the cybersecurity study ElevenPaths of Telefonica, a global networking firm, 5 G will be linked to cyber threats in 2020, including key technologies such as Ransomware, cloud computing, machine intelligence, phishing attacks, open banking and mobile malware.Blockchain is one way of providing safety , particularly for IoT devices. Originally this system was introduced to store Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Blockchains are distributed networks which are open to millions of users worldwide. The knowledge may only be added or modified, or copied by a cluster of the machine which is not controlled by any single person. Every data is crypto-graphically secured. During 2019, the investments in blockchain continued by FedEx, IBM, Walmart and Mastercard and will likely start showing real-world results encouraging its adoption.In these days, as thousands are forced to work remotely, private data volumes may become fully vulnerable or at the very least not secured. This emerging problem can give the development of this technology another impetus. In crowdfunding, governance, auditing of the supply channel, stock storage, prediction markets, IoT, neighborship micro grids, and stock trading, cybersecurity may also be applied to the sector.4. Extended RealityExtended Reality (XR) technologies are not news at this point, but they are now widely used for entertainment, making interactive interactions more immersive (Snapchat filters and Pokemon Go-style games). XR typically encompasses augmented reality, enhanced reality and mixed reality.Instead of viewing on a television, Virtual Reality ( VR) is using computer technology to create a virtual environment using headsets that integrate the physical world into the digital 3D environment. Contrary to VR, the Augmented Reality (RR) does not create the entire digital environment to replace actual and virtual objects on real world mobile screens or displays. Mixed reality (MR) is an extension of AR, meaning that the users can communicate with real-life digital objects (remember that the AR headset plays a holographic piano).In training, simulation and new ways of engaging with clients, the impact of virtual and enhanced reality will be rising, creating new shopping opportunities (particularly during lock-ups when thousands people go online shopping). The development of virtual resources for collaboration (Slack, Zoom) would make the workforce smaller by 2020, eliminating the need for costly office space. However, AR and VR will virtually bring workers into physical space in 2020.5. 5G Network5 G is known as the future of connectivity for the whole of the telecommunications industry and a leading edge. The 5 G networks will be implemented between 2020 and 2030 according to a vision of Huawei Technology , allowing for the likelihood that people will be linked to wired computers. These mobiles can provide us with super fast download and upload speeds (five times faster than 4 G functions) and more reliable connections.Although 5G mobile data networks were first available in 2019, they were still largely expensive and usable in restricted regions or major towns. This is anticipated that 5 G would have more cost-effective service plans and much greater coverage. And wired networks that operate in our homes and businesses will become more available. The increased bandwidth would allow growth in the IoT and smart machinery sector , allowing large amounts of data to be collected and transmitted. For regions without an Internet service or poor coverage, access to 5 G mobile Internet may be a critical necessity during a pandemic.Tech patterns are not established independently, you may have noticed, but in a synergical way. The 5 G and edge computing technology will provide the increase of computer power and become a cornerstone for the IoT applications of the next generation. The integration of AI, Big Data , IoT and Edge Computing blockchain technology helps to resolve problems with the online and offline mapping of data. AI and cloud computing will be strengthened by the growth of quantum computing. A combination of AI and IoT will result in artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). This will enable IoT devices to analyse data, make decisions and act on that data without human involvement. This combo may contribute do the development of applications for smart retail, drone traffic monitoring, smart office buildings, fleet management, autonomous driving, and autonomous delivery robots.In our view, these were the strongest technical developments. However, the coming developments entail implementing tools and human resources, and we will look at them more closely, as we promised at the beginning of the report.The first column displays technical skills, which according to Udemy research have grown in popularity between 2016 and 2019. Some of them include AI, cyber-security and cloud computing. The second and third columns are the most prominent new technical know-how in 2020. The lists indicate that machine learning, cloud computing, the programming language and other front-line frames are in high demand. Looking at different points, we note the importance of AI and Cloud computing. We can see therefore which tool this year will contribute to the evolution of technological trends.In view of emerging technological developments that are strongly interrelated, companies should adapt their strategies to reality, predict society's needs and provide solutions to future problems taking the circumstances in which we live and all work today into account.","45,565 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,84.6M,4.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-useful-IoT-Internet-of-Things-devices-for-use-at-home

When we started Chronicled, we weren’t thinking about Yeezys specifically, but we did have a goal in mind. That goal was to create a global protocol for blockchain that allows any object to be registered to, verified against, transferred on, or--in the case of the special class of objects that had a chip inside--to sign off on events, messages, accesses, financial transactions, etc.Not sure what that has to do with your sneakers? Let me explain.Chronicled was founded in 2014. We set out to explore non-financial use cases for blockchain. The average person has probably heard of blockchain in the context of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. And while blockchain does underpin those cryptocurrencies, the terms aren’t interchangeable. Blockchain isn’t Bitcoin, it’s the technology that makes those cryptocurrencies possible.And it turns out that blockchain has plenty of other uses. We founded Chronicled in order to investigate those non-financial uses by building the first IoT x Blockchain laboratory in the world. Much of our early work in that laboratory was focused on fine art, consumer products, and luxury goods. Why? Because those are industries with a high prevalence of counterfeit goods. Some industries, like pharma, lose billions of dollars each year due to supply diversion and counterfeit products.But how could we create a unique identity for a piece of fine art painted on a canvas? Or a bottle of rare wine? Or the designer purse you ordered online last week? The answer: tiny microchips, just like the chip inside your credit card.In 2015, Chronicled began working with companies to embed, or affix, cryptographic microchips in or on luxury and consumer products. We would then register those encrypted identities to a blockchain so they could be authenticated. Those microchips can’t be copied or corrupted. They have a unique identity that allows consumers to determine whether or not the 1947 Cheval Blanc on their dinner table is the real deal.Those were the first two primitive protocols we developed at Chronicle—Register and Verify. There was finally a way to register fine art, luxury goods, and consumer products with an unreproducible identity that could then be verified by the consumer. It’s a game-changing concept that is already creating a safer, more transparent buying process for consumers.But let’s keep moving. Fast forward to 2016 when we were hard at work on the newest uses for blockchain. Many of our clients were interested not only in using the blockchain to register and verify the identity of an object, but also in using the smart contract feature of blockchain to securely transfer custody and/or ownership. In parallel with our own move into smart supply chain, more enterprise players were beginning to work with blockchain technology as the vast possibilities became evident.Even JP Morgan had gotten in on the action with Quorum, their own enterprise ledger and smart contract platform. So, we went from registering and verifying products, to also transferring custody, ledgering data and events, and tracking provenance of an item over time using more powerful systems and smart contracts. In 2016, we began working on our next two protocol primitives, Transfer and Ledger, and our Smart Supply Chain platform was born.The Smart Supply Chain Initiative led us to some incredible projects in several different industries. For instance, we began work on the MediLedger project, a joint venture that set out to solve the problem of counterfeit drugs in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We’ve also worked on a responsible gold venture to track the provenance of the world’s gold supply, and with our partner Ambisafe we will tokenize physical gold by linking the physical gold bullion identities to digital, tradeable ERC20 tokens for the first time in human history. In the future, we can track many kinds of conflict minerals with this same blockchain approach.Notice that industries all across the spectrum are benefitting from blockchain. That’s not a coincidence. Moving forward, the trust, security, and data privacy that blockchain brings is going to change and improve nearly every industry.So, let’s flip ahead on the calendar and start looking at what the future holds. It’s 2018, and our sixth protocol primitive is in place—Value Transfer. Chronicled’s Blockchain x IoT API is not only powering unique product identities and supply chain tracking and provenance, but it can also enable machine payments and IoT economies.Picture this:A drone hitches a ride on an Uber and uses the charging port on top to refuel. Then it makes a micropayment for the ride and the charge before resuming its journey. If you think that sounds futuristic, then you’re going to be in for some surprises in the next few years. We’re talking about decentralized energy grids. Fully secure and connected smart cities. And eventually, a fully connected world running on the protocols that we’ve built.Blockchain technology is set to change everything. It’s time to start paying attention to the innovations that blockchain is creating, because the pace of disruption is only going to increase. The progress we’ve made at Chronicled in just three years has been astounding, and we’ve only just begun.","31,102 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,10.9K,78.7M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Did-you-have-solar-panels-installed-on-your-house-If-so-was-it-worth-it-or-do-you-regret-it

Except, you won't actually have control of those things. Just like you don't really have control of your Nest thermostat. Sure, you can turn the dummy dial up or down, but you don't control how it works, when it's powered up to collect or send data, what kind of data it sends, to whom, or what they do with it. It's in your home, watching what you do, kind of doing what it wants, and there are layers of software between the buttons you press and the things it does, and those layers are controlled by other people in that Google building whom you'll never meet.The joy of using Internet of Things products is that the complexity of managing hundreds of little sensors and robots will be hidden from you, tucked elegantly behind some colorful and fun-to-read social app that is many, many steps removed from actually controlling those devices.When Nest got bought for $3.2b it wasn't because it was selling a lot of thermostats. Selling thermostats is a crappy, marginally profitable business. Most people go their whole lives without ever buying a thermostat. If they do buy one, they sure as hell aren't going to be brand-loyal, and if they are it's going to be to Honeywell which owns 50% of the entire US market. It sure as hell isn't for selling smoke alarms, which is far, far less profitable and lucrative than the thermostat industry, and for which their first version of widely released product got entirely recalled.Nest got bought for $3.2b by Google - a company that literally takes everything it knows about you and then sells that to advertisers - because it strapped an information collection device onto the back of a thermostat and sold it to a few million rich people.So no, everybody won't be able to interact with Internet of Things in the future. The Internet of Things will mostly seem like ""smart"" devices; they'll just turn on when you walk into a room. And then they'll tell somebody about it.

However, we live in the 21st century where educational tools are constantly evolving and have come a long way from ink pens, quills and wooden slates to smart boards, blogging applications and online tutorials. Technological advancement has taken us by storm and the education sector is no exception. It has replaced almost everything that was once considered crucial to impart education with gadgets and applications that have made our lives immensely easier.Technology Helps Students And the Teachers AlikeThese technological changes have benefitted the students and the teachers alike. In recent years, technology has opened several new doors in the form of new learning opportunities for students through online courses, distance learning programs, online tutorials and digitized classrooms. Although technology can not completely replace teachers and professors, it has now shifted their role from being the core source of information to being guides needed to help interpret and understand this information. Online courses and distance learning programs not only enable people​ to access and enrol in courses offered by various universities and educational institutions that would have been otherwise inaccessible to them but also helps them acquire new skills in the comfort of their own homes​. This method of learning is cost effective, flexible as you can study whatever you want and self paced because most of the online courses let an individual work according to his own timeline.It is a Big global village !Technology thus promotes self learning in the long run and brings the global village to the student’s place of residence. It not only helps people enhance their knowledge and develop real world skills but also enables them to interact with their fellow classmates from all over the world thereby inculcating strong communication skills and introducing them to various different cultures.Choose your Pick – eBooks, podcasts, educational videos, educational games, tutorialsEducational resources, now, are only a click away and widely available on the internet to anyone who is interested in learning. Resources like eBooks, podcasts, educational videos, educational games, tutorials etc. are easily accessible and are not only used extensively by individuals but are also being increasingly used by teachers in classrooms as a supplement during their lectures. Apart from these, a huge number of educational computer softwares are now available in the markets that have simplified the learning of complicated algorithms and concepts. Although they do come with a certain number of disadvantages but they are outweighed by the numerous benefits of using such softwares. Educational videos and visual aids promote learning inside as well as outside the classroom and have a much deeper impact on the viewer’s mind than simple textbooks. Advanced technical aids in the education sector work on the principle of experience and let an individual experience concepts and theories. This enhances the student’s analytical skills, proficiency and critical thinking while making understanding comparatively easy. This would have been impossible five decades ago when technology wasn’t as advanced as we have it today.Interactive ClassroomsTechnological advancements have not only benefited students but have also helped teachers immensely. They can now integrate various spheres of education through online presentations and online quizzes while ensuring that their classes remain interactive. An article by the National Math and Science Initiative even showed that students tend to remain focused and get better results if blended teaching methods are used especially for subjects like science, technology and maths. In addition to this, virtual lesson plans, online tests and grading programs help teachers save a lot of energy and time which can be used to enhance the classroom teaching experience.Technology has its pitfalls tooWhile technology has definitely made our lives easier, it comes with it’s own pitfalls. It is important to remember that the overuse of anything can be detrimental in the long run. Thus, educators​ all across the globe need to maintain a healthy balance while using gadgets and technology in the classrooms. Afterall the future of the world does lie on the shoulders of the youth. We don’t need a generation of smart phones and dumb people, do we?","74,988 followers",Neman Ashraf,4.5K,410,36.8M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-role-of-technology-in-education-in-the-next-10-years

They help you gain respect from your team, network with like-minded professionals, and most importantly, build trust with your customer base.These skills refer to personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively with other people and are essential if you plan on pursuing a career in the tourism and hospitality industry. Examples of soft skills include communication abilities, teamwork and problem-solving skills as well as time management and effective leadership qualities.From working in hotels, restaurantsSoft skills are important for any job role, regardless of your industry. They help you gain respect from your team, network with like-minded professionals, and most importantly, build trust with your customer base.These skills refer to personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively with other people and are essential if you plan on pursuing a career in the tourism and hospitality industry. Examples of soft skills include communication abilities, teamwork and problem-solving skills as well as time management and effective leadership qualities.From working in hotels, restaurants or bars to running conferences and events, the increasingly popular hospitality industry offers a lot of potential for career development and has a variety of roles to choose from. If you want to pursue a career in hospitality, however, it’s important to first focus on building your soft skills in order to stand out to employers and progress in your career.Here are of the most important soft skills to focus on before pursuing a career in the industry:Communication skillsMost of the daily responsibilities when working in the hospitality and industry sectors are customer facing, making effective communication skills key. You’ll be interacting with people from a range of backgrounds and ages so it’s important to be able to effectively present information to them and understand their needs. These skills can be a make or break in the industry and are ultimately what will keep your customers coming back for more.Emotional intelligenceWhile industries today are becoming increasingly digitised, it is human contact that lies at the heart of hospitality and tourism, making it a relatively stable field to pursue. As a service-reliant industry, a lot of your job will involve dealing with customers’ complaints or issues. Being able to resolve these issues in a calm and timely manner will help you develop a top-rated customer experience.TeamworkThe hospitality sector is fast-paced and ever-changing, meaning that you will need to work closely with your team if you want everything to run smoothly, especially during peak season. Excellent teamwork skills improve performance with your team and encourage you and your co-workers to excel, even on the most challenging of days. These interpersonal skills also help to provide a positive customer experience. You are more likely to keep your clients using your service again if you are shown to be running a tight ship with a team of organised and helpful employees.Time managementCareers in hospitality and tourism will often require you to work on several tasks at once, especially during peak season. Having the ability to keep calm under pressure and manage a heavy workload through good time management will help you go far in this fast-paced industry.A positive attitudePositivity is infectious. Having a can-do attitude towards the tasks at hand will not only give you more fulfilment in your day-to-day role, but it will rub off on your co-workers too. Maintaining a positive attitude is also central to customer service and will help you build a loyal relationship with your clients. It’s important to remember that customers are everything in this sector. Your guests are ultimately the ones ensuring your business survives, so providing a positive customer experience is paramount.Want to launch your career in the dynamic hospitality industry? An MA in Tourism, Hospitality and Event Management from the Berlin School of Business and Management (BSBI) is the ideal first step.The international tourism management degree will provide you with a solid understanding of the hospitality industry while boosting your managerial and problem-solving skills.BSBI offers industry-relevant programmes, tailored to training the business leaders of tomorrow.

It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI asWhat you see below the screen is the RSI indicator. It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI as it’s falling from point 1 to point 2. Now the question is “Why the heck it the price going up but the RSI falling down?”.Well this is called Divergence. The real reason that this divergence showed up here is that the big (smart) money pulled out of the market at point 1 (Either all of the big smart money or a big chunk of it). Then after point 1 the price decreased for two weeks as you can see on the chart. Now that the big whales are out, the small fish came swimming and put their money in so the price goes up to point 2 but there’s a difference between price reaching point 1 and price reaching point 2. The difference is that for example 10 rich whales invested 10 billion dollars in bitcoin so it reached point 1, then they pulled out their money and the small fish came to play so 100,000 normal people invested 10 billion in bitcoin and it rose again to point 2. Do you see the difference? 10 rich smart whales don’t panic, they know what they’re doing, but 100,000 average traders who are looking to make a quick buck will panic with the first sign of danger. so from point 1 to point 2 those big whales pulled out of the market so slow and subtle that those fish didn’t suspect a thing. They kept buying the overpriced bitcoin and the whales were happy to sell at the top. One red candle shows up, the fish panic and sell like crazy and the rest is history.That divergence is the real reason why the prices dropped but there’s no reason to panic. Heavy drops are good for the market. The funny part is that now while the fish are panicking and selling their valuable assets those whales would enter again and buy the cheap coins to get ready for the $100k bitcoin (remember bitcoin dropped from $20k to $3200 to get ready for the $40k, $50k and $60k.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,735,0,0,7.0,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-evolutions-or-upgrades-does-Bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-require-to-solve-its-current-drawbacks

In line with Tesla's image of energy saving and environmental protection.These are all on the surface, and privately, they are determined by the ""two-layer struggle"" that Elon Musk is carrying out. And Elon Musk is using the power of the cryptocurrency market and fans to win these two wars.The cryptocurrency market will also undergo earth-shaking changes due to the battle of the new leader.Two warsThose who are familiar with Musk know that in addition to two very high-profile companies, Musk has been engaged in two wars, and these two wars have never ceased.Since Tesla and SpaceX are two companies that have almost no profit but are very money-consuming, Musk has been facing financing pressure.Remember Musk's cry in 2018? Musk tearfully reviewed the tremendous pressure he faced in the past. He believes that the past year has been the ""difficult and painful year"" of his career, largely because of Tesla's short positions.As an industrial capitalist, Musk is most afraid of financial capitalists. Tesla has also been relying on financial capital to survive to this day: In 2004, Musk led Tesla’s A round investment, and only used less than 7.5 million US dollars of personal funds to become the company’s largest shareholder (Musk’s shares is currently worth 100 billion dollars , the ""cost"" is no more than 10 million);After Musk ""led"" the round A investment, he soon led Tesla's $13 million round B investmentinvestment and soon in 2006, Musk jointly led the $40 million round C investment. Because of the rapid cash burn, in 2007 Musk led the fourth round of financing of 45 million US dollars, this time the two Google founders were persuaded to participate.Soon in 2008, Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy. Musk persuaded Daimler to exchange $50 million for a 10% stake in Tesla, and then he pulled Tesla back from the cliff of bankruptcy.Then in 2010, Toyota was persuaded to also provide Tesla with about $50 million in financing.In 2009, the US Department of Energy provided Tesla with a low-interest loan of US$465 million through the ""High-tech Vehicle Production Credit Project."" The loan provided by the US Department of Energy has played a further role in leveraging private capital. On June 29, 2010, Tesla conducted an IPO on Nasdaq, raising US$226 million from the public at a price of US$17 per share.In 2013, Tesla raised US$1.02 billion from the capital market (including US$660 million in bonds), and fully repaid the previous loan of the US Department of Energy; in 2014, it raised another US$2 billion to build a factory; in 2015, Elon Musk built a Model X stock raised US$738 million; in 2016, it raised another US$1.46 billion for Model3. After so many rounds of financing, Musk has always been Tesla's largest shareholder.In 2018, Tesla was shorted by the capital market. Musk ""cried"". The whole person was on the verge of collapse. No financing and being shorted meant that when Tesla was about to bear fruit, he would give in to financial capital and surrender control. right. (Financial capital controls the industry, the normal way is to provide financing and gradually gain control; in the case of unable to obtain control, it usually means that you lose the financing ability, and finally have to sell at a low price. Financial capital comes back to buy, and then gains Control) This is as painful as raising one's own child and then giving it to others for free.At the same time, Musk began to release ""fake news"" about privatization, which was ""tracked"" by US regulators. Since then, Musk has gotten into trouble with U.S. regulation. ""Iron Man"" himself can’t tell: I’m overseeing you to sit and watch this group of financial capital for shorting, and you will rob me of the fruits of my labor. I will fight back, but you will punish me!The ""weapon"" of the currency circleAlthough Musk survived after that, he himself knew that one day financial capital would make a comeback. There are still a bunch of people who are looking to short and waiting for opportunities to short Tesla. Tesla is still not strong enough to make money and falsify everything.So the currency circle, independent of the existing financial system, provides Musk with a ""way out.""The first thing that Musk tested was Bitcoin. After eating Bitcoin at a low price, Musk began to sing more on Twitter, which has 50 million followers.Musk posted Bitcoin-related content on Twitter on December 20, 2020 (the market value of Bitcoin was only $200 million at that time)Subsequently, on January 29, Musk changed his entire Twitter ""introduction"" to Bitcoin.Figure: On January 29th, after Musk changed his Twitter, Bitcoin jumped by US$800 in a short-term, which was as high as US$32,000.Musk has tasted the sweetness of financing on Bitcoin. Tesla's subsequent ""announcement"" showed that as of March 31, 2020, the fair market value of the company's bitcoin holdings was 2.48 billion U.S. dollars; this means that if the company cashes out the cryptocurrency, it is expected to record about 1 billion Investment income in US dollars.On March 31, the Bitcoin price closed at $59,000, and $1 billion of the $2.48 billion market value was profitable, indicating that the average cost of Tesla's Bitcoin holdings was only less than $25,000 per unit.In other words, before Musk longed bitcoins, he had already ""ambushed"" him.Because of Bitcoin, Tesla also created the highest quarterly profit in history in the first quarter of this year: 440 million U.S. dollars, of which the sale of Bitcoin brought in a ""profit"" of 100 million U.S. dollars, but the sale of the car lost more than 100 million. The profit comes from the sale of carbon credits.Musk, who enjoyed the sweetness of Bitcoin, also set his sights on the little-known Dogecoin. Before Musk cheered for it, the unit price of Dogecoin was only about $0.004, and now it has risen to a maximum of nearly $0.75. In fact, it has risen by a maximum of nearly 200 times in more than a year.After that, Musk announced that he would use Dogecoin financing to launch a lunar satellite next yearCan Dogecoin really ""release satellites""? of course can! If you have enough low-cost Dogecoins in your hand, you can raise enough funds to launch some by selling some.Musk is actually saying that SpaceX holds a lot of Dogecoin and has already raised a lot of money with Dogecoin.How much does it cost to put a satellite on the moon? The NASA space shuttle LEO, which was retired in 2011 and has a lunar carrying capacity, cost $450 million per launch at that time. The current cost plus satellites is estimated to be at least $1 billion or more.According to the market price of US$0.4/Dogecoin, 1 billion US dollars can be easily done by selling about 2.5 billion Dogecoins. It is said to be ""easy to do"" because the total amount of Dogecoin is as high as 130 billion, and it will increase steadily by 5 billion every year. And Dogecoin's holdings are very concentrated. There is an address that is suspected to be controlled by Musk, and the holdings are as high as 40 billion!Musk is winning the ""war""Through cryptocurrency, Musk allowed Tesla and SpaceX to achieve financing freedom.Then why fight against Bitcoin and Dogecoin?This is also related to the ""two wars"".When financing is needed, the market is in a bull market, and it is easiest to get financing; when financing is not needed temporarily, it is best to be a bear market, otherwise the money in the market will be raked by speculators.At the same time, if longing cryptocurrencies on one side, he will be targeted by regulators. After Musk longed Dogecoins, he was warned by the regulators, and his Twitter account was stopped for a while.Therefore, in a half-joking and half-serious way, fighting each other's statements and practices is the best way to make the supervision ""nothing to say""-I'm kidding, this won't work! ?The next time Musk controls the 8 companies, which one is ""short of money"" and needs financing, Musk will most likely stand up and shout out the cryptocurrency he holds.This financing method can not only get rid of the control and mocking of financial capitalists, but also easily raise money. Why not?And Musk’s fans are also happy to support him, because after he gets the money, he is different from other “little leaders” in the cryptocurrency circle to buy luxury houses, drive luxury cars, and give birth to a bunch of children. He wants to change the destiny of mankind and let mankind be an interstellar race. This couldn't help but make other ""little leaders"" start to doubt life and start to think: What do I want to do for mankind? In the future, the currency circle will be because of Musk, there will be more ""saviors"" who will change the destiny of mankind, or at least the destiny of others.","8,614 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,13.0,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-evolutions-or-upgrades-does-Bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-require-to-solve-its-current-drawbacks

It takes a lot of power in both computing power and electric power. In fact, the amount of electricity used to mine crypto is more than many small countries use. You have to buy a really powerful rig and keep updating it to get a leg up on your competition or you will actually lose money. One of the clever things Bitcoin has built in is that as more coins are mined, the difficulty in mining them goes up. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million and as of August this year (2021) , 18.8 million have already been mined. That leaves only 2.2 million left to get. It's going to be so hard to get those last coins that it's going to take about another 18 or 19 years to do it. This keeps the interest up for mining.How crypto works it's basically everyone has a copy of all the transactions so everyone can agree on what was bought, how much was paid, and who (obfuscated) did what. These miners are doing the math to keep track of all that. They are getting paid in Bitcoin to do it. That's called mining. Time will tell however if anyone is going to be minding (mining?) After there are no free Bitcoin to be had anymore. I'm guessing that the creator (whoever he, she, or they may be) figured that big companies would be so invested that they had to keep processing. Maybe I'm wrong but I think people are just going to lose interest and the value will drop substantially. If it goes down too much even now… it won't be worth the electricity or the cost in hardware to mine anymore and it will be a horrible downward spiral and everyone holding the bag of Bitcoin is going to be burned.You can see now that people v are jumping from one type of crypto to another as they think it may be easier or more profitable to do so. If there are too many types of crypto, that would keep all the prices down also.So you see it's not free money exactly. It's an upfront investment and risky, you could lose everything if you aren't smart and know what to buy, where to do it (places with low electricity prices), and when to get out of the game. It's a lot like investing in the stock market.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,4.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-cryptocurrency-mining-websites

The reward for authenticating transactions drops over time—it will be halvedHowever, while you can make profits through crypto mining, it is unlikely that you can do so all by yourself. To reduce the upfront costs, it is recommended that you join a mining pool. Mining pools allow miners to share resources and capabilities. Even still, the high volatility of Bitcoin can add uncertainty to the mining venture, and you must carefully consider that before you decide to hop on the crypto bandwagon.In this year, crypto is growing steadily with many projects in the market. According to latest reviews, HubCoin is one of the greatest choices for long-term holding. Since HubCoin is operated through the use of smart contracts, it eliminates the need for any middleman leading to gamers being fairly rewarded what they are due. It ensures that gamers are properly remunerated through its well defined and structured smart contracts and gamified systems.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,0.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-coin-mining-still-profitable

Before mass adoption, some were predicting it would be the next big thing, others dismissed it. From the electric light to the automobile, history is full of powerful innovations that initially looked like fads.But in each case, there came a point where adoption spiked. The costs fell. The benefits became obvious. Barriers to adoption were overcome.When I look back at the Internet pre-mass adoption, I see a lot of similarities with blockchain in its current state. It has incredible potential to change the way we live, but I can also see that it needs some work before we’ll see mass adoption.Lessons From The PastThe World Wide Web was created in 1991, but there were no browsers for it until 1993. It wasn’t until the creation of Netscape Navigator in 1994 that adoption began to accelerate.Netscape introduced the idea that the Internet should be for everyone. They created a consistent browsing experience across operating systems—something we take for granted now. And they made it all available free of charge. In effect, Netscape opened the floodgates for mass adoption of the internet.User Friendly WalletsFive billion people now have a mobile phone connection. In our current era, mobile devices have allowed billions of people to connect to the Internet and granted them access to information, even in remote locations. What mobile phones have done to accelerate proliferation of internet, blockchain clients will do for adoption of blockchain. One thing that’s holding blockchain back right now is the lack of user-friendly wallets—or clients--on mobile devices. Ease of use is key. It’s difficult to get people to use something if it actually makes daily life more complicated. As it stands, the general population doesn’t have access to mobile wallets that allow them to make payments with cryptocurrency.But blockchain doesn’t just need wallets, although making payments is what most people think about doing first. After all, people will want to spend their cryptocurrency. Blockchain’s Netscape is going to be something even more universal than money transfer.Where Is Blockchain’s Netscape?Like the Internet 1.0, blockchain is also a network that’s missing interfaces and browsers. What it needs is something that’s so user friendly, so elegant, that the user doesn’t know that they’re using blockchain.There are multiple ways that this could work.Imagine being able to sell your car, or even your house, via a simple asset ownership and transfer app. A decentralized DMV or Deed of Title would mean that you could find and buy a car on Autotrader. You could sell your house on Zillow. It would all be secured and authenticated on a blockchain.What about a literal browser for all the things in your vicinity? IoT devices, all registered to a blockchain, could then be “browsed” by users. At Chronicled, we’ve already developed an app to do just that, called Discover. It allows you to view and authenticate IoT devices that are within range. But we could be moving even further beyond apps or browsers and into actual infrastructure as blockchain technology matures.After Netscape?Netscape is no more. The browser wars with Microsoft in the 90s put it on a downward trajectory. But the Internet has only become more powerful and more deeply ingrained in our everyday lives. The same is going to happen with blockchain.The real innovation, that killer app that sets off mass adoption of blockchain, will power the machine to machine economy. In the M2M economy I envision, drones can self-authenticate, enter your home, and deliver a package. Amazon Key is already allowingIn a blockchain-connected future, I see homes that are connected to smart grids. They harvest their own wind and solar power and sell it back to the electric company, or even their neighbors. Manufacturing is directed by smart machines that determine demand and availability, then produce goods only as needed—all while paying the necessary parties through smart contracts.Will that vision come to pass? Maybe not immediately, but when blockchain has its Netscape moment, things are going to move quickly. Did anyone working on the World Wide Web in the early 90s envision exactly how we use the Internet today? I doubt it. And I think the same can be said about blockchain.I envision a fully automated, machine to machine economy, but is that what’s best for society? How different will my vision be from what actually comes to pass? It’s difficult to say. But this isn’t a technology that any of us can afford to ignore. Because blockchain’s Netscape moment is coming, and it may be here sooner than you think.","129,086 followers",Jessica Su,1.5K,1.5K,49.6M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/The-internet-was-extremely-inaccessible-in-the-early-days-until-Netscape-made-it-much-easier-for-the-general-public-to-browse-the-internet-What-could-be-the-%E2%80%9CNetscape%E2%80%9D-for-Blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-what-kind-of-program-is-required

The electricity market has utilities on the supply side and consumers on the demand side, with blockchain you can integrate consumers with renewable power assets like solar, wind into the local grid to act as Prosumers. The inherent de-centralized nature of blockchain technology allows to create a network of multiple nodes embedded into the electricity distribution grid creating a so called smart grid. The blockchain acts as the accounting ledger for such a grid storing the transaction records of production and consumption by each prosumer/consumer for billing purposes. This allows to create a more competitive market where the prices cannot be dictated by utilities alone.**EDIT**To further expand the above, consider a distribution grid with prepaid meters for consumers. Normally consumers would load the amount in the meter wallet based on their estimated consumption. They would thus buy the power from the utility at fixed rate and consume that many units until their wallet balance is exhausted.Now consider this in a blockchain scenario, you can replace the fiat with say an ERC-20 token, where each token is pegged to the price of 1 unit of electricity. You then define the smart contract which governs the use of the token. The network will have an infinite supply of these tokens, and while tokens can be bought or sold, the consumption of electricity units would deplete the tokens from the network, meaning they get destroyed and cannot be recovered.So within the grid, you have the power producing utility which produces say 1000 units daily and decides to sell the same at 10¢ per token, you the consumer who consumes 100 units daily, purchases these tokens from the utility and is allowed to consume that many units of electricity. Next, I move into your area and put up solar on my house that generates 150 units daily. I utilize the 100 units I need internally and export surplus power of 50units back into the grid for say 5¢ per token. Suddenly you now have an option to procure power at less rates, 50x10¢ from the utility and 50x5¢ from me your neighbor. Multiply this scenario 1000 fold and you now have a very dynamic and competitive market where the price can no longer be dictated by the utility, while giving a chance to those with renewable assets to capitalize on their investments.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,1K,21.7K,235.2M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/The-internet-was-extremely-inaccessible-in-the-early-days-until-Netscape-made-it-much-easier-for-the-general-public-to-browse-the-internet-What-could-be-the-%E2%80%9CNetscape%E2%80%9D-for-Blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-what-kind-of-program-is-required

Because it can build it’s rockets with 320 times less money than NASA!! OMG!! Amazing!!Yeah well…kinda.Altough this is an amazing achievment it’s not really revolutionizing space travels by means of engineering, there’s no huge improvement in motors or technology really…you know why??Because SpaceX doesn’t take care of R&D, they just use NASA’s patents, that why they can build cheaper spacecraft’s, all the costy work is done.If you read carefully through is biography you can see that Elon is focused,determined, good willed ( but he can be the biggest jackass in the face of the planet), and smart, but he’s not even close to a genius, he’s more of a businessman than engineer.He uses the same materials everyone does, he just get’s them cheaper, he doesn’t bring any technical advancements to the table, he get’s really smart people to do the hard brainy work, so he doesn’t have to.So yeah, the guy’s smart, but most of it is just what the media wants to portray, and some people just eat it up.","8,614 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,15.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-mining-at-home-a-more-profitable-solution-than-buying-directly-cryptocurrencies

Things always have, haven’t they? For crying out loud, you’re Elon Musk!Right now, Elon Musk is being pulled in a million different directions. The man has started over half a dozen tech companies, and has dipped his hands in countless more.I’m a skeptic of Musk and those who herald him as a “genius”. He’s not going to make it to Mars by 2024 (NASA will probably have beaten him by the time he does), his “Hyperloop” won’t be capable of the initially proposed 1,000 mph travel (if it’s ever built), and his attempts to conceive AI will be infertile until we master quantum processing (and, as Richard Feynman once put it, ""if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics”). Musk is a trailblazing businessman, not some super-scientist.That said, there’s no denying Musk’s footprint on the world. He’s inspired countless people, and his successful ventures have benefited countless more. In the coming century I expect him to be remembered as a critical stepping stone toward scientific progress, in the vein of Jobs, Tesla, or Edison. I’ll admit he’s made a recent string of mistakes (this article from the New York Times should bring the unaware up to speed:From what I’ve gleaned, Musk is a man who’ll settle for nothing less than the actualization of his vision for the world.

Any answer I might give will be completely colored by my own experiences, so full disclaimer this is not an unbiased piece free of personal narrative.It is said that you cannot dream yourself a character; you must hammer and forge one yourself.

Any answer I might give will be completely colored by my own experiences, so full disclaimer this is not an unbiased piece free of personal narrative.It is said that you cannot dream yourself a character; you must hammer and forge one yourself. If any leader and any company has done that, and continues to do that it is SpaceX. To try and capture in words what working with Elon is like, I’d like to share some specific memories, particularly of one really rough day and its epic aftermath.On Aug 2 2008, 8 months after I joined the company, SpaceX launched its third flight of the Falcon 1 launch vehicle. Falcon 1 was the predecessor to the Falcon 9 launch vehicles that the company flies today.It was a defining moment for the company. Elon had a couple years prior stated in the press that his $100M personal investment in the company would get us up to 3 tries and if we couldn’t be successful by the third flight we may have to admit defeat. In addition to the pressure created by this narrative in the press, the lobbyist armies of our competitors (largest, most powerful defense contractors in the world) had been in overdrive in DC trying to undermine SpaceX and damage our credibility by painting us as too risky and inexperienced in order to protect their multi-billion dollar interests in the space launch business.However, shortly after the first stage flight, immediately following stage separation (when the first stage of the vehicle detaches and falls away from the 2nd stage of the vehicle which continues its journey to space) we lost the vehicle and mission.SpaceX, VP of Propulsion Tom Mueller, the modern day godfather of rocket science and one of the most brilliant scientific minds on the planet, and his team had done such a great job redesigning the vehicles engines systems that they were even more efficient and powerful than in some ways projected.We turned off the first stage engine, and then proceeded to separate the vehicle stages; however when the stages uncoupled there was still a little leftover ‘kick’ or thrust in the first stage engine- so our first stage literally rear ended our second stage immediately after we had tried to separate the two sections of the vehicle. It was a devastating emotional experience.I stood around with the then 350 or so employees, and we cheered the vehicle on as it took off, and as we were watching the mission clock and knew that the stages were about to separate - the video feed was cut. The company is on a 20 second viewing delay from the mission control team as we are being projected the external press feed which is delayed in case of major mission anomalies. So when we lost video, we knew something had gone wrong in a big way.Elon and about 7-8 of the most senior technical people at SpaceX were commanding the mission from a trailer in the back of the Hawthorne factory; and we all waited anxiously for the trailer door to open and for someone to tell us something. The mood in the building hung thick with despair; you have to keep in mind that by this point SpaceX was 6 years old, and many people have been working 70-80+ hours a week, swimming against extremely powerful currents, like difficult barriers in technology, institution, politics, and finance- by sheer force of their blood and sweat.They had all given so much, were mentally and physically exhausted, and really needed a win in order to replenish their spiritual wells and give them the faith to keep following this man up a treacherous mountain that had depleted the hopes and resources of the many others who had come to conquer it.This night would forever impact the future of the company, it had the potential to send the company into a downward spiral, from which we may not have ever recovered. A failure in leadership would have destroyed us not only from the eyes of the press or potential consumers but it would have destroyed us internally.When Elon came out he walked past the press and first addressed the company. Although his exact words escape me in how he started off, the essence of his comments were that:I think most of us would have followed him into the gates of hell carrying suntan oil after that. It was the most impressive display of leadership that I have ever witnessed. Within moments the energy of the building went from despair and defeat to a massive buzz of determination as people began to focus on moving forward instead of looking back. This shift happened collectively, across all 300+ people in a matter of not more than 5 seconds. I wish I had video footage as I would love to analyze the shifts in body language that occurred over those 5 seconds. It was an unbelievably powerful experience.What happened in the days and weeks following that night is nothing short of a series of miracles:So for those who ask the question, this is in my opinion the true character of Elon Musk. Undeterred in the face of all odds, undaunted by the fear of failure, and forged in the battlefields of some of the most terrifyingly technical, and capital intensive challenges that any human being could choose to take on. Somehow he comes out alive, every time - with the other guy's head on a platter.Working with him isn’t a comfortable experience, he is never satisfied with himself so he is never really satisfied with anyone around him. He pushes himself harder and harder and he pushes others around him the exact same way. The challenge is that he is a machine and the rest of us aren’t. So if you work for Elon you have to accept the discomfort. But in that discomfort is the kind of growth you can’t get anywhere else, and worth every ounce of blood and sweat.","5,929 followers",Alex Lightman,1.1K,752,6.9M,18.0,https://www.quora.com/Will-Elon-Musk-ever-think-about-other-options-in-green-energy-solutions-other-than-solar

What's important is that you're thinking, what can actually happen in future and then selecting those particular stocks. It doesn't matter if you're wrong or right just keep your stock selection that way and work in small quantity if it's a penny stock.P.s.2- I will still suggest to avoid penny stocks. Go with the market leaders when they are available at lower prices. You can easily get 20–40% returns in a year which is more than enough. Don't be greedy, good things take time.

There are more than 1300 plus crypto-currencies present. I am only writing the basic rules that will help you to mine crypto-currencies successfully. Let discuss it with the help of Bitcoin.Bitcoin Mining Profitability FactorsHardware CostsThe most obvious expense in Bitcoin mining is mining hardware. Better, newer miners will cost more, so if you’re serious about investing in Bitcoin mining then aim for efficiency (more below). In addition to a Bitcoin miner, you may need extra cables, power supplies, software, and cooling fans.EfficiencyA bitcoin miner’s job is to convert electricity into hash power. Miners that do this using the least amount of electricity per hash are the most efficient. The Antminer S9, Antminer S7, for example, converts electricity to hash power at 0.25 W/Gh. The SP20 Jackson, a popular miner by Spondoolies Tech, converts at 0.65 w/Gh.Electricity costs vary by location, but this means that an Antminer S7 run in the same place as an SP20 converts electricity nearly three times more efficiently. It’s important to compare both hardware prices and efficiency when purchasing a miner.ElectricityMiners with low electricity costs have an advantage, as monthly costs are much lower. Venezuela’s government has implemented price controls, which has created some of the lowest electricity prices in the world. According to an article from Bitcoin Magazine, a 320 kw electric bill cost just 6 cents. About 1,000 people mine Bitcoin full time in Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is an extreme example, but shows how cheap electricity effects mining profitability.DifficultyBitcoin mining difficulty measures how difficult it is to find a new block. Assuming a stable Bitcoin price and no change in your hash rate, expect your earnings to decrease as difficulty increases. If difficulty were to decrease with a stable Bitcoin price, your profitability would increase.When taking difficulty into account, note that:To understand Bitcoin difficulty in details see my blog :Bitcoin PriceEarly Bitcoin miners were able to gather thousands of Bitcoin. At the time, however, one bitcoin wasn’t worth one penny. Bitcoin’s price, or the purchasing power of one bitcoin, must be considered. A sharp drop in price can turn slightly profitable miners unprofitable very quickly. Price changes are factor, but it often makes more sense to simply purchase bitcoins if your goal is Bitcoin price speculation.Block RewardBitcoin’s block reward halves every 210,000 blocks. Assuming the Bitcoin price remains the same, each block halving cuts miners’ profits in half. Even though block reward halvings are known events with expected dates, it can still have effects on the market and price of Bitcoin.Location and WeatherMining farms in hot areas will overheat and require large amounts of cooling fans. There have been fires at mining warehouses created by the excess heat. It is much easier to run a mining farm in cool areas. The heat generated from miners can even be used in place of regular heating to cut costs.DowntimeLarge mining operations have employees working 24/7 to ensure that all hardware is working properly. A few hours offline could be the difference between thousands of dollars in profits.Now that you understand the many factors that will affect your mining profitability, plug in some numbers to any Bitcoin mining calculator.

Fundamental Analysis.‘Fundamental analysis’ simply means the foundations of an investment – their team, their ambitions, their strengths etcHere are 10 Easy Ways To Pick Which Cryptocurrency To Invest In1. The Community.A bit part of a cryptocurrency’s success is it’s following – so look out for cryptocurrencies with strong communities and loyal followers because that shows people have a genuine interest and belief in the cryptocurrency.Run through some subreddits, YouTube channels and some of the feedback from their communities – and see what they’re saying about your potential investment.2. Fundamental Analysis.‘Fundamental analysis’ simply means the foundations of an investment – their team, their ambitions, their strengths etc.If you’re new to cryptocurrency, don’t sweat the technical stuff!In the long run, fundamental analysis is going to help you just as much as technical analysis.So understanding how to do fundamental analysis will help you make better investment decisions. And in a market where most people are chasing after low quality altcoins, fundamental analysis allows you to separate the wheat from the chaff.3. The Team.One of the top things you can research is the cryptocurrency’s team. In fact, researching and vetting the team behind a cryptocurrency is one of the most important factors you can look into.4. The Technology.A big part of a cryptocurrency’s success is the underlying technology:You have to understand how it’s going to perform against their competitors – and what makes the technology stand out from the crowd. Look out for the big innovators – the cryptocurrencies that will completely disrupt their industry.5. The White Paper.Everytime a new cryptocurrency is released, they usually bring out a white paper too. This will outlines the purpose of the coin, it’s technology, how it works and it’s overall vision (I’ll come onto that next).A white paper is one the best places to evaluate the fundamentals of a coin – and you should never invest anything into it until you’ve read their white paper.6. Their Vision.The vision of the cryptocurrency is really important:You want to make sure this coin will be around for at least the next 5-10 to ten years, and if they’re not thinking long term then you should be seriously worried.You should only invest in a cryptocurrency with a strong vision that can go the distance and pay off in the long-run. While short-term gains can be exciting and you might be thinking about swing trading, you should still think about where the cryptocurrency is going to be in the next 5, 10, 20 years, etc.7. Their Leadership.The success of a coin is navigated by the leadership team – they’re the ones who make all the big decisions!The leaders are the ones that carry out the vision, so research their team and look at what they’ve achieved so far.8. Pricing History.Pricing fluctuations gives you a strong history of the coin and if it will be a solid investment for the future.9. Credibility & Reputation.Is the cryptocurrency respected online? Do they have a strong reputation?At the end of the day, if they have a bad reputation then you know you probably shouldn’t invest your money into them – you really need to have strong credibility and trust to be successful in this field.So run some google searches, look through crypto communities and see what people are saying about the coin.10. The Road Map.When you’re deciding which cryptocurrency to invest in, you should look for a coin with a solid road map and strong plans for development.This is the key if you’re looking for long term success.","55,746 followers",Loy Machedo,582,5.7K,66.2M,4.0,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-is-the-best-way-to-use-solar-energy-for-cryptocurrency-mining

There are some, but not as much as we were assured. If a central bank (a consortium) decide to manipulate the currency, it is very easy to do so. A government can decide to devalue everything in a country overnightWhy Crypto?It is controlled by a decentralized, distributed network of users with equal control. Progress is controlled by consensus — that is a key innovation. There is not ‘elected people’ to make a decision, we do ourselves.Crypto breaks people’s reliance on the government, it democratizes their ability to persist and subsist.I do believe crypto is just a start; the big picture is not out yet. Block chain is the next WEB.We will be going forward to the block chain benefits in no time. Now we are in the starting stage, consider as in early era of Internet.Future’s apple, Amazon, facebook and google has not out yet, they probably are getting shaped in some dorms or out houses and I am sure some of them are in China!So, yes Cryptos will do have shining future, but invest in those who actually solve a problem- don’t just throw your money just because of some hype.

A solid example is the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com), a company i invest my cryptocurrencies with that pays me double my invested amounts in 7 days of investmentThe early days of Bitcoin mining are often described as a gold rush.Satoshi Nakomoto’s invention of Bitcoin, “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” opened up an entirely new frontier, not just of freedom but of occasionally outrageous profits.Those with a strong interest in such things, namely cypherpunks, cryptographers, technically-minded libertarians and assorted hackers, were first to stake their claim.But is there still gold in them thar hills?The fact is:Bitcoin mining has grown from a handful of early enthusiasts into a cottage industry, into a specialized industrial-level venture. The easy money was scooped out a long time ago and what remains is buried under the cryptographic equivalent of tons of hard rock.The sad truth is:Only those with specialised, high-powered machinery are able to profitably extract bitcoins nowadays. While mining is still technicallyIn other words, mining won’t beWe’ll explain this situation in depth but first, you need to know a few basic technical terms from the world of Bitcoin mining:Block:A group of Bitcoin transactions, chosen fromA new block is created on average every ten minutes.Proof of Work Hashing:This is the cryptographic work which miners perform in order to find the solution which allows them to define a new block.PoW hashing ensures the proper function of the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic “puzzle,” known as aThere are no shortcuts in this process, which can only be solved with raw computational power.By correctly hashing the current block, minersBlock Reward:The number of newly-created bitcoins, awarded to whichever miner creates a block.This number was initially set to 50, halved to 25 in late-2012, and halved again to 12.5 in mid-2016. The next halving event expected is around mid-2020.This halving process will continue in this fashion, halving the block reward approximately every four years / 210,000 blocks, until all 21 million bitcoins are created.Achieving the block reward is the only valid way in which new bitcoins can be created; by miners according to the code’s rate and limit.Hashrate:Hashrate is the measure of a miner’s computational power.The higher their relative power, the more solutions (and hence, block rewards) a miner is likely to find.Initially measured in hash per second (In early 2017, Bitcoin’s collective hashrate reached nearly 4 Exahash. This represents a tremendous investment into mining hardware, the R&D of such hardware, and electrical expenditure.Difficulty:With hashrate shooting up over the years, it would seem blocks would be found by miners ever more rapidly.Bitcoin’s Difficulty measure is what prevents this from happening. It adjusts to hashrate to ensure that blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes.Note how closely Difficulty matches Hashrate in the 2 charts above.When total hashrate rises, the Difficulty of POW hashing adjusts upwards – and the inverse also applies.Difficulty auto-adjusts every two weeks (or 2016 blocks).BTC / XBT exchange rate:The current fiat price of Bitcoin is critical for calculating profitabilityW/xHash/s:Watts per hashrate per second. Electricity is the major on-going cost of Bitcoin mining. The price paid per Watt will greatly influence profitability.Mining Pool:Unless you command a tremendous hashrate, your odds of solving a block by yourself (i.e. “solo-mining”) are extremely low.By banding together with other miners in a so-called pool, your combined odds of solving a block rise proportional to the pool’s total hashrate.Whenever they solve blocks, pools reward individual miners according to their contributed hashrate (minus commissions and the like).Calculating Mining ProfitabilityWith these terms in mind, it’s possible to calculate the current profitability (circa March 2017) of Bitcoin mining for your circumstances.Note:TheThis is due to the ever-changing nature of the Difficulty modifier and the BTC price, in particular.To begin, we must select a suitable ASIC mining rig. To aid in selection, the Bitcoin Wiki provides a handy mining hardware comparison:Although Bitcoin Wiki doesn’t list many models as currently shipping on from their manufacturers, all these mining rigs (and more) are available for resale as new or used.The Bitmain AntMiner S9 is a modern mining rig which offers a good hashrate for its power consumption.It’s pretty much the cutting edge of mining tech so we’ll select it for our example.The S9 is available for roughly $1800 up to $2400 from Amazon, or about $1365 from BitMain, shipping excluded. Power supply units will add another $120 or so to the price.Next, we need to enter the S9’s specs and cost, as well as other info such as power cost and pool fees, into a suitable number-cruncher.Cryptocurrency Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining Profitability offers a good mining profitability calculator, which automatically fills in the currentScenario 1: Big Chinese MinersWe are using the defaultTo determine your own power cost, check worldwide electricity prices or your utility bill for the exact price.The 0%Once all the necessary info is entered, hitAn excellent result! At this rate, the S9 unit would pay for itself within a year as well as make about $600 in profit! As a large miner would be able to negotiate a lower unit price on each S9, we can assume they’ll research profit even sooner.Scenario 2: An American Hobby MinerBefore getting too excited about your potential mining profits, let’s recalculate them using the average residential power cost per kWh in the USA (~12.5c) and a typical pool fee of 1%.The result:It’s not looking so great now.At a Bitcoin price around $1150, it appears that the average American home miner makes only $1348 a year, assuming difficulty and price hold steady. In other words, the unit will pay for itself within a year.However:This is a dangerous assumption! Bitcoin’s total hashrate – and thus its difficulty, has been consistently rising since the early years, sometimes jumping by double digit percentages within a month!Therefore, any calculations should be regarded skeptically, as likely best-case scenarios.Sources ofDifficulty Spikes, Price Crashes, Equipment Failures, Power Cuts, Shipping Delays & More!Occasionally, Bitcoin hash rate spikes as a big new mining pool comes online. This happened in early 2016:It’s quite possible that even some big, corporate miners found their profit margins under threat from the resulting steep spike in competition. Indeed, in mid-2016, Swedish Bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner declares BankruptcyThe home miner really has no chance to compete in such a challenging environment, unless they have access to free or extremely low-cost electricity…Also bear in mind that the rate of obsolescence in Bitcoin mining hardware is quite fast! New, more efficient mining hardware may be released at any time, although we are reaching the technological limits of improved efficiencies.If pre-ordering any such equipment, be aware that potential manufacturing, shipping, customs or other delays could end up being very costly as difficulty rises or price falls during the interim.There are plenty of other things which can wrong, for example:Such downside risks must always be factored into any sound business plan.ConclusionThe average home miner will struggle to be profitable or recoup the cost of mining hardware and electricity, especially with the Bitcoin downward price trendProfitability is highly unlikely given the current circumstances.The situation may improve in future once ASIC mining hardware innovation reaches the point of diminishing returns.That, coupled with cheap, hopefully sustainable power solutions may once again make Bitcoin mining profitable to small individual miners around the world.This would also greatly improve the decentralization of the Bitcoin network, hardening it against legislative risk.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,0.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-mining-cryptocurrency-Hardware-software-and-or-hibrid

If you are looking to enter this field in 2020, here is what you need to know about the business.What Does It Take to Mine Bitcoin in 2020Bitcoin mining is a transaction security and validation service done via distributed computer systems each racing to solve complex mathematical problems before the competition.Miners Keep the global ledger consistent and immutable by repeatedly adding newly requested transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified. For providing their valuable hashing power to the cryptocurrency network, miners are rewarded each time a new block is created by them in this fashion.Anyone thinking about entering this line of work needs to know that long gone are the days where one could just mine bitcoin with a desktop PC or even an old laptop. These days, any profitable bitcoin mining is done via computer systems tailored exclusively for the task, professionally called application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. The most popular bitcoin mining machines are the Antminer series from Bitmain, but there are additional hardware offerings from companies such as Microbt, Canaan, Ebang and a few others. Take note that while some machines are available to be purchased off shelf already, or even immediately as second hand goods in online markets, when the newer models come out there is often a waiting period until they are shipped, and you need to take that into consideration.Other than the upfront cost of the hardware, your main expense as a miner is electricity. The power is primarily for operation of the computer systems themselves, but also for ventilation and air conditioning systems that might be needed depending on the situation. This is why professional miners routinely migrate around the world to locations that can offer them an optimal combinationof lower electricity prices and hospitable weather.Once the hardware is all set up, you then need to direct your mining machines to a mining pool such as F2pool, Pooling and Antpool. These are groupings of miners that compete to get a block together and share the rewards according to the contributed hashing power, thus spreading the work and streamlining the revenue for each one.How to Start Cloud Mining With BitcoinAn easier alternative to setting up your own mining operation is to go for cloud mining. This is a way to generate cryptocurrency that doesn’t require buying any expensive equipment, or installing the infrastructure needed for it.

Many people either give up or lose money as a result of their lack of understanding of how to generate money using cryptocurrencies.The cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages of growth. As the value of crypto-assets rises, more people enter the market. These newcomers are constantly attempting to figure out how to profit from cryptocurrency.The good news is that there are numerous methods to profit from cryptocurrency. Since 2011, the bitcoin business has seen constant growth in developer engagement, social media activity, and the number of start-ups launched.We'll look at ways to generate money with cryptocurrencies in this article.Can You Make Money With Cryptocurrency?Yes, cryptocurrency may be used to create money. Because of the inherent volatility of crypto assets, the majority of them are high-risk, while some necessitate subject knowledge or skill.One of the ways to generate money using bitcoin is to trade cryptocurrencies. Despite the fact that the daily average volume of cryptocurrency trades is only 1% of the foreign exchange market, the crypto market is extremely volatile. As a result, there is the potential for short-term trading.Even though the cryptocurrency business is still small, it has a lot of room to develop. Along with some of the more well-known cryptos, such as:Similarly, there are a slew of crypto-buying services, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Robinhood, giving you lots of alternatives when it comes to generating money with cryptocurrency.Apart from the obvious manner of trading, there are a variety of ways to make legal money using cryptocurrency.Let's look at an insight trick which no one talks about that automatically generate cryptocurrency learn6 Strategies for Making Money with CryptoLook no further if you want to learn how to generate money with cryptocurrencies. Three mechanisms are used to make money with cryptocurrency:Here are six techniques for making money with cryptocurrencies based on these three mechanisms:Each of this techniques are great and explored in details.. Note learn insight trick that will always generate cryptocurrency for you find out1. InvestingInvesting is a long-term strategy that involves purchasing and holding crypto assets for an extended period of time. In general, crypto assets are well-suited to a buy-and-hold strategy. They are highly volatile in the short term but offer enormous long-term growth potential.The investing approach necessitates the identification of more stable assets that will last for a long time. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, have a history of long-term price increases and can be regarded secure investments in this regard.2. TradingWhile investing is a long-term strategy centered on buy-and-hold, trading is designed to take advantage of short-term opportunities.The cryptocurrency market is quite volatile. This means that asset prices can fluctuate considerably in the short term.You must possess the necessary analytical and technical skills to be a successful trader. To create correct forecasts about price increases and declines, you'll need to evaluate market charts on the performance of the listed assets.Depending on whether you expect the price of an asset to climb or fall, you can take a long or short position while trading. This means you can earn whether the cryptocurrency market is bullish or bearish.3. Staking and LendingStaking is a method of verifying cryptocurrency transactions. You hold coins when you stake, but you don't spend them. You keep the coins in a cryptocurrency wallet instead. Your coins are then used to validate transactions on a Proof of Stake network. As a result, you will be rewarded. To put it another way, you're lending coins to the network. This permits the network's security and transaction verification to be maintained. You'll get a reward that's equivalent to the interest a bank would pay on a credit amount.The Proof of Stake algorithm selects transaction validators depending on the amount of coins you've pledged to stake. As a result, it consumes far less energy than crypto mining and does not necessitate the purchase of expensive machinery.You can also choose to lend coins to other investors in exchange for interest.4. Crypto Social MediaYou will be rewarded for creating and curating content on a number of blockchain-based social media networks. You are frequently awarded with the platform's own coin.5. MiningCryptocurrencies mining is a way to generate money using cryptocurrency in the same way that the early adopters did. Mining is still an important part of the Proof of Work system. It is here that a cryptocurrency's value is created.You get rewarded with new coins if you mine a cryptocurrency. You'll require technical know-how and an upfront investment in specialized hardware to mine.Mining is a subset of running a master node. It necessitates knowledge and a large initial and ongoing expenditure.6. Airdrops and ForksTo raise awareness, airdrops and free tokens are issued. To build a big user base for a project, an exchange might execute an airdrop. You can acquire a free currency by participating in an airdrop, which you may then use to buy items, invest in, or trade with.A blockchain forks when aprotocol changes or improves, resulting in the creation of new currency. If you have coins on the old chain, you will usually receive free tokens on the new one. This indicates that because you were in the correct position at the right moment, you received a free coin.More~learn how to grow crypto automaticallyThanks for your time Make sure you gave me an upvote and share if my airticle added value",242 followers,Sumit Kumar,2.1K,0,0,5.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-mining-cryptocurrency-Hardware-software-and-or-hibrid
6,"Yes and NoYes because until ethereum and bitcoin are still mineable there will be a lot of money to be made for existing mines. These are the only cryptocurrencies profitable to mine long term.No in the long term, If you want to get into mining then it is too late for this cycle. The hardware is too expensive and risk of not ROI is huge. Mining is not relevant anymore as most new coins are created with the Proof of Stake transaction validation mechanism and there is not a lot of sensible coins left that are mineable. Proof of Stake is the more efficient mechanism.","7,440 followers",Liya Sah,15K,0,0,6.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-mining-cryptocurrency-Hardware-software-and-or-hibrid

The second winter of AI started in the late eighties and continued till the mid of the first decade of the current century when high computational power machines and storage became easily available and affordable.The present sharp rise in the number of AI applications is due to several factors. Firstly, during the last few decades, the computational power and storage capacity of computers has been increasing while the cost has been decreasing due to the advances in the electronics used in complex digital circuits. This has made computing more and more affordable. One of the main requirements for application of AI is the availability of high computing power, large memory and storage, which have now become affordable. The cloud technology has supported it further.

Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...",16 followers,Cory Hicks,572,0,0,9.0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-take-the-country-forward

These companies are financially as strong or sometimes stronger than their American counterparts. Having access to such a large population helps. That the government helps by restricting competition from outside definitely helps a lot.This domination does not end just in technological sector. Siemens and Alsthom had to merge in September this year (2017) to counter CRRC in the high speed rail building industry. This merger will bring a 18billion$ competitor to CRRC which is having an annual revenue of 35billion$. They are very active in infrastructure projects in Africa where the western world is not so involved.The government is stable and enforcing technological advancement with authority (of course it is difficult to enforce such things so hard in democratic countries). Intelligent Steel making , Indistry 4.0 , Driverless Electric buses (running in Taiyuan), Electric Taxis all are examples of Government backed advances. Sometimes experiments fail like the straddling bus in Qinhuangdao.

In theory, it is a relatively simple process in which you require a robust ASIC miner (Application-specific integrated circuit), smart mining software, and pool, and you are good to go. However, in reality, the process is a little more complicated than that.Bitcoin mining is much more competitive now than it was a few years ago.However, you can earn more Bitcoins at less price with a bit of time using Bitcoin mining by following some general tricks.While large-scale enterprises have the resources to fund the initial investment and set up large bitcoin mining farms, small businesses do not. Regardless of the size of investments, businesses of every scale can make a profit. While the size of revenue will undoubtedly vary, the opportunities and the profit percentage can remain the same.For instance, setting up a large farm will require more hardware, software, resources, and power, increasing the initial investment. On the other hand, if a small-scale business sets up to resort to marketplaces like #Zionodes for getting a handful of machines, the initial costs, power consumption, maintenance, and additional miscellaneous charges will also reduce.So, bitcoin mining is still profitable for large-scale and small-scale businesses if done correctly. Also, by making some intelligent choices for the initial investments, you can further increase the profits and slowly and gradually leverage these profits to expand your business.The four main aspects that determine the profitability of any bitcoin mining operations are:But in reality, not everyone can mine Bitcoin as they expect. In that case, you can take a look at new projects with low price, but with great potential with clear, transparent background information. That's how I invest and find it quite effective, but it requires a lot of research. I recently learned about a project called F11, which has native token $F11 that is launched on Uniswap as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. This app strives to improve your everyday football experience by providing live results, in-app games, the F11 Champions League, and fan participation through NFTs. I feel like this project was born for me, as well as for football fans around the world.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,155.3M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-small-scale-cryptocurrency-mining-dead

More the capital investment the more will be the growth of a country.Four Priorities of Budget 2022PM GatiShaktiIt is driven by seven engines: Roads, Railways, Airports, Ports, Mass Transport, Waterways, and Logistics Infrastructure.It is also about formulation of Master Plan for expressways. Completing 25000 km national highways in 2022-23which if succeeded will be a great help to India but if you’ve been tracking the budget since 2015 Government has also promised Bullet Trains, Everyone’s gonna have a house of their own till 2022 and what not.So Government often use such fancy terms in their Budget but if atleast half of it is expected. Till then let’s hope for the best.Agriculture & Food ProcessingWell Again it’s a good initiative in educating farmers and reducing their efforts through High-Tech Services.EducationIn this Budget Government has really come up with a plan to educate the students who were left abundant due to covid & it has really hampered their growth.In this Budget Government has introducedGovernment has proposed to introduce upto 200 dedicated TV Channels for each Standard and in different languages in which students can get glued to & educate themselves.It will not be limited to only schools & colleges but also be conducting various skill enhancement programmes, Virtual Labs and many more.High quality e-content will be delivered through Digital TeachersA Digital University will be established with world class quality universal education.All Inclusive Welfare FocusThere’s an old saying in Post Offices10 baje aao toh office band11 baje aao toh Breakfast Hour1 baje aao toh Lunch Hour2 baje aao toh Office band hogya.4. Issuance of chip embedded E-Passports : Speaking honestly making my passport wasn’t really tough for me I got my passport within 7 days that too without tatkaal and I really like the physical passport but still its okay to have it electonically like Aadhar & Pan Cards.5. Providing a battery swapping policy as an alternative to setting up charging stations in urban areas : It can beTax ProposalsThis is the most talked about area & many rumours have also been heard that the basic exemption limit (upto which no income will be taxed) of ₹2,50,000 will be increased but there’s no room for middle class people in this Budget.Instead Government has found some new areas of interest.For Example : If I buy BTC of ₹100 & sell it on ₹130, the income of ₹30 will be taxed at a flat rate of 30% i.e ₹9 which I consider is lottery rate because 30% is a rate of tax which is levied on Lotteries, Betting on Race Horses & all sorts of Gambling.Therefore clearly Government is not trying promote the exchange in Crypto.Also Government has put the definition of VDA very wide & open for further inclusion which includes:&Set-off of LossesSet-off is basically deducting your loss from the profit of other head. Suppose you’ve earned a profit of ₹10,00,000 from sale of a Flat in a year & also incurred a loss of ₹1,00,000 in Business therefore you can set-off your business loss from Capital Gains.In simple words, if there is a loss on the transfer of a virtual digital asset, it will be a dead loss and it cannot be used to reduce or set off from any other income.Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)On transfer of VDA payer needs to deduct TDS at a rate of 1%For Example : If you buy BTC of ₹200 & sell at ₹300, TDS will be deducted on the transfer value of ₹300 & you’ll only get ₹297 by selling but the tax of 30% will be levied on ₹100.Claim of Input Tax Credit (ITC)Earlier if a person purchased something & paid GST on it he could claim input on that GST even if the supplier hasn’t uploaded the invoice.Later it became 10% of the uploaded invoice or un-uploaded whichever is lower.Then it became 5% of the uploaded invoice or un-uploaded whichever is lower.& now if the supplier hasn’t uploaded you cannot claim ITC on it.ConclusionAll in All I prefer it is an economy boosting budget focusing the crucial areas of help and need people expect from Government. Considering the election the Government might have introduced a boasting & popularizing Budget but they didn’t. Rather there’s nothing for Middle Class people in this Budget but they might come up with something next year, until then let’s see how this works.If You like my effort please do upvote, share it with your friends & family & follow me.So till thenThis is Saif AliSigning off.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,7.8K,5.6K,426.3M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-small-scale-cryptocurrency-mining-dead

As cryptocurrency miners' computer power goes up, so does their mining power. When people solve the mathematical challenges that allow them to validate blockchain transactions through proof of work, they get rewarded with more cryptocurrency. A much more reliable way is using proof of stake and proof of authorityThe proof-of-stake and proof-of-authority methods are significantly less energy-intensive than proof-of-work validation. If those building blockchain applications move toward less energy-intensive methods of verification, there should be a resultant decrease in blockchain energy consumption.Focus on sustainable ways to mine bitcoinAs mentioned earlier, the computing setups used by cryptocurrency miners are primarily responsible for the exceptionally high energy demands of the blockchain. Fortunately, efforts are underway, such as an initiative by Cryptosolartech in Spain, to mine bitcoins with solar or wind energy.Imagine If everyone involved in bitcoin mining should mine individually… Imagine each person involved in bitcoin mining having his/her warehouses for housing bitcoin mining devices and equipment… Another way to minimize is by mining pool and cloud mining.

Focus on growth industries and stocks.The world economy is changing at a rapid pace, with some industries expanding and others contracting. Some of the fastest-growing sectors include cloud computing, e-commerce, financial technology, and healthcare.The technology sector in particular is attractive as a growth industry. Technology innovations drive progress in essentially every other industry, and tech's dominance has only been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Investing inAs for specific stock picks,Stocks such as these may not be the”cheapest” stocks available, but they trade at premiums for good reason. Each of these companies is steadily increasing both revenue and profitability and plays a core role in the modern economy.Since investing in high-growth businesses can greatly increase your portfolio's2. Buy dividend stocks.Investing inThe best dividend-paying companies are those that steadily increase the dividends paid over time. A company that consistently raises its dividend is usually a growing company. To evaluate which companies are best positioned to raise their dividends, consider the free cash out of the company in question.A company with an increasing stock price and dividend can generate significant investment returns over long time horizons. The key is toWhen selecting dividend stocks, don't simply invest in the stocks with the highest dividend yields . An above-average dividend is often a indicator that there's something wrong with the company.3. Invest in ETFs.Buying shares in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a great option for investors who don't want to choose individual stocks. These passively managed funds track the performance of certain indexes, have low expense ratio, and can provide exposure to entire asset classes. ETFs, which confer instant portfolio diversification, are also well-suited for taxable investment accounts since their holdings change infrequently.An ETF may be indexed to the S P 500 (SNPINDEX), such as theMany ETFs are focused on specific industries, such as the4. Buy bonds and bond ETFs.You can also addA bond is a loan to a business or organization. Bondholders are entitled to collect interest payments during the bond's term and receive the bond's face value in a lump-sum payment at the end of the period. Although bonds are generally less risky than stocks, they also generate lower returns over the long term. The bonds with the highest yields are known as junk bonds and are issued by companies that are less financially stable than their peers.Another consideration when investing in bonds is that the interest payments from bonds can be taxed as income if you are using a taxable brokerage account. Exceptions include most municipal bonds which are bonds issued by local governments.Most bonds can only be purchased in $1,000 or $5,000 increments, which can make it difficult to diversify your bond holdings. For this reason, many investors instead opt to put their money in bond ETFs since they are more affordable and already diversified.5. Invest in REITs.While buying real estate is another great way to diversify your investment portfolio, owning property is not cheap. Even owning a few properties would not result in a diversified portfolio. For that reason, many investors may prefer to buy shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs).REITs are professionally managed portfolios of properties. Most REITs are organized around a real estate theme such as shopping malls or data centers. Because REITs are required to disburse to shareholders at least 90% of their taxable income, which is generated by rent and interest payments, REITs often pay higher dividends than most stocks. Their share prices can also appreciate in value as the price of real estate rises.Shares of REITs trade on stock exchanges just like shares of any public company. REITs can be especially appealing to income-focused investors, but it's important to realize that REIT payouts are typically taxed as ordinary income in taxable brokerage accounts.Remember to diversify your portfolioRegardless of how you choose to invest your $100,000, establishing a diversified portofolio is key to achieving your financial goals. No single company or investment should have an outsized place in your portfolio. Diversifying eliminates the risk of your portfolio's value changing dramatically if one company encounters misfortune. A diversified portfolio is also more likely to generate relatively consistent returns from year to year.A good range for how many stocks to own is 15 to 20. You can keep adding to your holdings and also invest in other types of assets such as bonds, REITs, and ETFs. The key is to conduct the necessary research on each investment to make sure you know what you are buying and why.Invest to minimize taxes and feesWhen putting your $100,000 to work, take care to minimize taxes and fees. Over long periods of time, expenses on your investments can significantly reduce your returns since every dollar subtracted from your portfolio is a dollar that is no longer earning compound interest.Consider using a tax-advantaged retirement account. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs), including traditional IRAs and Roth Iras, confer valuable tax savings. Contributions to traditional IRAs are often deductible from your tax bill, and withdrawals in retirement — when you may be in a lower tax bracket are taxed as ordinary income. Contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.Other tax-advantaged options include 401 (k)Regardless of the type of retirement account, the earnings accumulated in the account are tax-deferred. And, in a taxable investment account, you are not obligated to pay taxes on gains until you sell the security (All investments bear some sort of expense. Be on the lookout for hidden fees, especially if you invest in annuities offered by insurance companies orA recap on how to invest $100,0001. Pay off high-interest debt.2. Establish an emergency fund.3. Begin your investing journey.Your specific investment goals and risk appetite predominantly determine how you should invest your money. Risk-averse investors or those nearing retirement may choose to invest more conservatively, while risk-seekers or younger investors may opt to buy mostly stocks.Once you establish your portfolio, remember to stay focused on your investment goals and the reasons why you invested in each security.

Smaller, spherical tokamaks, super-conducting magnets and lots of practical and theoretical calculations indicate that we are really close to net energy gain - continuously - in systems that have been studied and the physics pretty much under control.One of the less-understandable problems for the general public to grasp is handling of tritium, one of the two isotopes used for fusion. Tritium is a gas, just like hydrogen, and is both a fuel and a product of the fusion reaction; but it happens to be radio-active. It is not at all, really, serious: the amounts around a fusion facility will be very small, it has a half-life of 12 years, the radiation emitted (beta radiation) cannot penetrate clothing, skin or indeed almost anything will shield it. But when regulatory bodies (and indeed the lay public) see “radiation” they imagine tons of radioactive waste building up. Yes, tritium is radioactive, and should be controlled, but it is not at all like uranium, plutonium and the other scary radioactive materials in the nuclear energy world. And this is one of the major reasons experiments on D/T fusion are limited (another is the extremely high price of tritium!).So, where is fusion now and what’s the future? At present, entrepreneurship and leadership in the fusion community, worldwide, is lacking.

That is still low probability, but here comes the total number of atoms in the reactor(stellar core). The low probability of fusion keeps our sun to fuse atoms even after 4.5 billion years. If the fusion probability was higher, the sun would be burning faster, would have higher energy output… it would live much shorter. Large stars would be impossible, these would explode during their formation. If the probability was higher then for example Jupiter or even small gas giants would be stars.

We all know that conservation of mass is a thing, so what gives? Well mass has still been conserved, but we must look at things through the eyes of relativity. UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

No luck so far.However, there is this: Fission reactors have a LOT of fuel (Uranium, usually) in them. Tons of it! And lots of radioactive decay products of nuclear fission. If something goes disastrously wrong (Chernobyl) there’s an awful lot of radioactive material to spread around.Fusion reactors will presumably have very little fuel at one time, as it gets fed in and burned up continually. Grams, maybe. Pounds - no way! And the “fuel” is relatively harmless. Deuterium, Lithium, stuff like that. The Fusion reactor itself, on the other hand will be quite radioactive: The many tons of whatever its built from will have been intensely irradiated by the fusion going on, producing radioactive material, but I doubt that it can match the wide variety of nasty stuff from a fission reactor. So: I think a fission reactor would have far more potential for radioactive contamination than a fusion reactor, once we have one. But explosive danger? No.[ Thought added in edit: I do see one problem peculiar to the type of fusion reactors we’re working on now: the huge magnetic field they require. These magnetic field are critical to the fusion reactor operation, and the stronger the field, the smaller the reactor can be. These fields store a LOT of energy, and depend upon superconductors to keep the huge currents flowing. If part of the electric circuit drops out of superconductivity, the energy gets dumped into that failed part, and will create a huge electric arc, likely destroying the field coils, possibly destroying the whole system. Something similar happened in the early days of the supercollider in Switzerland/France. No hydrogen explosion, probably nothing to scatter things far and wide, so little danger to surrounding community, and they have ways to prevent this happening, they think.

As a power source, the fusion-fission hybrid would also allow for fission power without enrichment, which would potentially make the world a safer place by allowing the use of nuclear power without any proliferation risks.The idea is to take advantage of one of the byproducts of a fusion reaction: the production of large quantities of fast neutrons. These neutrons would be used to split nuclear fuel, thus generating power. Because the neutrons are provided by fusion, the fuel does not require a high concentration of fissile isotopes to generate a sustained reaction. Essentially any such source would be suitable as a fuel in such a reactor, and they could be run using the nuclear waste of standard nuclear reactors.The core of the device is a Tokamak which is covered in a blanket of nuclear fuel. The Tokamak is run below Q=1. We are much closer to the development of a Tokamak that can sustain this operation than the development of a Tokamak capable of fusion power on its own. Obviously, there are a variety of engineering challenges that remain before such a system can work, but it is closer than one might think. Tokamaks are understood much better than they used to be, and their stable operating times are over a minute in some cases, which is a reasonable amount of time when compared to the relevant time-scales predicted by plasma physics, which means that with more improvements it will be possible to confine plasmas for much longer. One of the main challenges of any use of fusion energy is developing materials that do not change their properties when exposed to massive amounts of energetic neutrons, and this case is no exception.Here is a link to an article that closely consults the protagonists of this idea:http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/01/27/nuclear_hybrid/","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-minimal-viable-product-for-nuclear-fusion-power-reactors-look-like-What-are-the-barriers

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,145 followers",Franklin Veaux,550,47.3K,779.3M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-minimal-viable-product-for-nuclear-fusion-power-reactors-look-like-What-are-the-barriers

Only ICF fusion will for the foreseeable near future be able to reach fusion conditions for advanced Generation-3 fusion reactions like He3-He3The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) First Generation deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Fusion Plasma Density and why it matters -ICF fusion uses the densest fusion plasma which results in operating fusion plasma capable of supporting the largest release of energy for a given size fusion device.ICF fusion plasma is literally 10^10 times more dense than the plasma routinely generated in Magnetic Confinement tokamak experiments like ITER or stellarator experiments like W7-x. The energy that can be drawn from plasma at fusion conditions is not a linear relationship with plasma density but is rather proportional to a squared function of plasma density - so small improvements in operating plasma density matter and greatly influence whether a particular technical approach to fusion is capable of producing break-even energy. This is particularly true in the case of small mobile fusion applications like wearable ARC fusion reactors.Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium). The more advanced third generation He3-He3 fusion reaction has the additional benefit that it produces no neutrons at all and as a result has much relaxed shielding requirements.Fusion has many significant advantages over nuclear fission when used in direct small mobile fusion applications -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for a wearable fusion reactor application and deserve attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be very efficiently collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be personal wearable ARC reactors?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary. ICF fusion power plants will probably be significantly smaller and at least initially, for a few decades, be more reliable than MCF fusion and may ultimately be of a size that could be installed in mobile applications (ships, trains, planes, trucks, and ultimately, perhaps, personal ARC reactors).Comparison of major nuclear fission and nuclear fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and small fusion applications ----------",UNKNOWN,Steve R.

One needs to breed tritium and this requires some replacement neutrons to overcome any losses. These neutrons would most cheaply be produced via fission, for example a fission-fusion hybrid.

A pretty significant miniaturization, already, I think.Why further miniaturization is difficult is down to the physics and engineering. There aren’t any good pictures of the physics package of a W76, but here’s a naked W80, a cruise missile warhead of 150 kt yield:As a thermonuclear warhead, it is comprised of two parts: the fission primary, and the fusion secondary. The fission device is a nuclear weapon with a yield of around 5 kilotons. When this detonates, it irradiates a can of lithium deuteride fuel, causing the lithium to split into tritium and neutrons; the tritium then fuses with the deuterium, liberating more energy,InAbout the size of a softball. At detonation, this was crushed by the couple of tonnes of explosive around it so that it became dense enough that most of the neutrons created when the plutonium atoms split would hit other plutonium atoms — the so-called “critical mass” — producing 8.4 × 10¹³ joules of energy.Through clever engineering the required mass of plutonium in modern weapons to produce a chain reaction has been reduced by around half, and greatly reduced the amount of explosive needed. The yield is reduced to around a quarter, but the yield of the primary isn’t as important as the fact of it being a nuclear detonation next to the fusion fuel.A small quantity of lithium deuterideThe lithium deuteride yields about 50 kilotons per kilo of LiD, and the amount can be varied in the design up to hundreds of kilos, before it becomes more efficient to daisychain multiple secondaries off one primary. The W80 above therefore probably contains 3 kilos of LiD, or nearly four litres, while the W76 contains 2 kg. I guess the bottom limit might be arbitrarily small in theory, but probably isn’t worth pursuing, since you can do various things to a fission device to increase the yield instead.The bomb-maker’s rule of thumb for making a fission detonation is that you want around eighty generations of fissioning plutonium atoms emitting 2–3 neutrons per fission, most of which hit another plutonium atom, causing it to fission, and so on. Hypothetically, you might be able to squeeze more neutron-plutonium collisions out of a smaller lump of plutonium… somehow… but practically speaking, 3 kilos appears to be the limit of our engineering skill.Now, you can also make a fission weapon physically smaller than an office waste-bin. The W82 was a device designed to fit in a 6″ (155mm) artillery shell:The physics package was a tad smaller than 155mm in diameter and probably around 500mm long at most. This had a yield of only 2 kilotons, though, and used something like the 6 kilos of plutonium of an older bomb, because of the limitations on the clever things — as well as the explosives and plutonium — you can fit in something the volume of three boxes of wine (don’t judge me) to increase the yield.So, the short answer is that you need a good-sized lump of plutonium, a layer of explosives, and a certain amount of lithium deuteride to make your thermonuclear bomb, and we are probably near the limit of how much beryllium mirrors, neutron generators, tritium gas, uranium tampers, air lenses, and so on, we can add to make that more efficient.There might be room for miniaturisation in the design of anti-matter bombs down to whatever size you’re hoping for — if only we could produce enough antimatter for such a bomb, and knew how to build them.","3,383 followers",Nelson Cunnington,2K,3.1K,23.1M,9.0,https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-minimal-viable-product-for-nuclear-fusion-power-reactors-look-like-What-are-the-barriers

Central to the TMSR design is a liquid mixture of LiF, BeF, and highly enriched fissile U233 or U235 fuel that acts as both fuel and core coolant.Thorium Molten Salt Reactors, when built, promise to be exceptionally safe fission power plants with good power to weight (power density). These qualities tend to suggest TMSRs for some space applications. TMSRs in space could be particularly well suited to operation as colony reactors on the Moon and on Mars, providing reliable power to keep early settlements going.Reliability and safety are paramount concerns for early colony reactors which will depend for their very existence on reliable power to maintain living conditions in the colony. The four year operational experience that Oak Ridge National Lab had with the MSRE Molten Salt Reactor prototype suggests that a TMSR reactor would be both safe and reliable.Zero gravity operation of TMSRs does bring some unknown complications and would require additional study and experimental testing to assure safety. Some of the engineered safety systems routinely included in TMSRs, like the gravity driven safety salt storage tank used under accident conditions to shut off fission and safely store salt and fuel for reactor restart may not work at zero gravity.Substantial Thorium fuel deposits are known to exist on both the Moon and on Mars.Survey by the mars odyssey spacecraft for Thorium deposits on MarsFusion actually has many advantages, long term, over fission power plants of any type in space applications. It should be recognized, however, that current fusion technology is less mature than fission technology. We have far less operational experience with fusion power plants than fission power plants both on earth and in space. In the longer term, there are reasons to believe that fusion power will be extensively deployed both on earth and in space.Specific types of Fusion can have significant advantages when used in space propulsion, bettering the performance of both chemical or fission based thermal nuclear propulsion rockets -Since the 1960s, fusion research has focused on the D-T reaction, as it appears to be the least challenging from the perspective of plasma confinement and reactor technology for utility grid power generation. Steady progress toward the objective of terrestrial net fusion power generation continues to be made, with most development funding devoted to the magnetic plasma confinement approach (MCF).The primary fusion R&D effort currently underway is a very large magnetic confinement device called ITER, which is projected to lead to net power generation (~2030) and a follow on DEMO fusion tokamak is expected to produce at 10 Gigawatt (GW) of commercial electrical power in the 2050 time frame. A power system with this specific mass too heavy for a spacecraft application. Enabling a “step function” decrease in initial mass in Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO) and mission duration for the human exploration of Mars requires an in-space power-propulsion system with specific mass well under 3 kg/kWe. This cannot be accomplished within the limitations of the heat engine conversion required by current MCF tokamak D-T fusion reactors such as ITER.There are almost certainly, however, more suitable forms of fusion being developed for space. Fusion that produces energy in short controlled bursts is likely to be lower mass and higher power to weight than Magnetic Confinement DT fueled tokamaks. Such pulsed fusion energy reactors are called Inertial Confinement Fusion orThere is literally 10^10 times more fusion fuel in space than all forms of fission nuclear fuel combined (Thorium, Natural Uranium, and Plutonium) in the Universe.(There is 10^10 times more hydrogen and 10^6 times more deuterium than all fission nuclear fuels taken together in the universe - note log scale on Y axis)Some reasons why fusion is a good technology for space1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny amounts of fusion fuel (grams) are initially required to begin production of industrially significant amounts of fusion power. Fusion scales more easily and elegantly both larger and smaller than any known fission reactor technology that is currently available that must contain at least a critical mass (and in practice, many hundred critical masses) of fission fuel to operate.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space.

It’s the U233 bred from Th232 that drives a Thorium salt reactor. TheA molten salt reactor has already melted down if it’s in operation. Think about it, the salt has to be molten in order to be piped around the system. What is there to melt down then?But, let’s say I introduce a surplus of U233 to the mix, which raises the reactivity of the slurry.(Yes, I said Uranium-233. Thorium-232 doesn’t react. It’s a neutron capture feed stock. When it captures a neutron, it goes through Beta decay and becomes Uranium-233. U233 is a self-fissile material that actually produces energy and extra neutrons. It’s the U233 bred from Th232 that drives a Thorium salt reactor. The benefit is that, under normal operation, Thorium breeds 108% of the consumed U233 per year of operation. And Thorium is several million times easier to get than the U235 used in most modern reactors. Now… back to the answer.)The reactor core begins to heat up. The liquid salts begin to heat up, which causes them to… expand.The expanded fluids move the U233 atoms further apart. This reduces their effective target radius for expelled neutrons from fissioning U233 atoms, and the rate of reaction slows down, until some equilibrium is reached.In other words, adding more U233 heats up the reactor, but only to a certain extent. Keep adding more and the reactor keeps heating up. Remove the U233, or add more salt to thin it out, and the reactor cools down.This is one of the ways to “throttle” a molten salt reactor. You need more power, you add more fissile material. You need less, you either extract some fissile material or you add more inert salts. Most of them would be built with neutron eating control rods as well, but a simple “no moving parts” version could do it entirely by “adjusting the mix.”Okay, but what if you added a huge amount of U233?Then the reactor would get so hot that the “freeze plug” at the bottom of the reactor, made by electrically refrigerating molten salt back to where it solidifies, melts from the excess heat, and the super-critical fuel of the reactor dumps through a set of valves into separate small tanks.Each of these tanks are far below critical mass, and the reaction stops in its tracks, and the salt cools back down and hardens.In other words, when a molten salt reactor gets hot enough to “melt down” through the bottom of the tank where the freeze plug is, it uses a passive, gravity fed system to shut itself down in such a way that it’s totally safe.But….Let’s say you had a lunatic at the controls.He dumps dozens of times the normal amount of U233 into the reactor, and the increase in heat instantly causes vaporization of the molten salts. Now you have what is, effectively a “steam” explosion.But, unlike a boiling water reactor, there’s not a pressure vessel around the reactor, so the rapidly vaporizing salts spray up out of the reactor vessel into the inside of a containment building. Without a pressure vessel wrapped around it, there’s noWhere the salt blobs, now far below critical mass, solidify into solid blobs of slightly radioactive material.A bunch of guys in lead suits show up with brooms and lead containers, and collect all the salts from inside the building, and put them into the containers. The salts are taken to a processing plant, where the U233 is extracted back out chemically, and the fuel is reclaimed.The building is eventually cleaned up, the damaged reactor is repaired or replaced, and the lunatic is locked up in SuperMax for life.Total casualties… probably zero, unless some poor schmuck happened to be leaning over the reactor core at the time — which would probably be a bad idea anyway.So. Worst case, with a homicidal lunatic at the controls, he might be able to irradiate the inside of the containment building and kill a couple of people. Big deal, he could probably endanger more people with a pipe bomb made from baking soda and vinegar.Of course, there’s no way they’d actually have enough pure U233 on-hand to actually super-charge the reactor like that. There’d be no point. And if they did, then our Lunatic would be better off using it to make a dirty bomb or a nuke than trying to melt down the reactor.Molten salt reactors are just inherently safe because of their design. Even against lunatics.","2,201 followers",Iain McClatchie,668,411,2.8M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-minimal-viable-product-for-nuclear-fusion-power-reactors-look-like-What-are-the-barriers

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-take-to-make-radical-breakthroughs-quickly-in-fusion-energy-technology

Heating and cooling are both thermal processes.Nuclear, Electricity, coal,oil or gas are just energy transfer methods, Batteries if you like, not needed if the sun delivers it straight to your door.My initial estimates is that thermal processes like heating, cooking, refrigeration, air-conditioning, etc account for about 80% of energy requirements. Thermal fridges and freezers will require conversion from gas, kero or other thermal sources to hot oil or hot water.If you need to generate electricity, say for lighting, computers, battery charging or laundry then the heat can be converted, to electricity, by at least three different means.By Stirling Engine at 30 to 50% efficiency.By Steam engine or Turbine at 35 to 20% efficiency.By Seebeck Device at about 8%.Alternately you can install a small solar PV system with small lithium ion battery at between 25 and 6% efficiency depending on the type of solar cells you buy. Unlike CST which uses almost 100% of the available spectrum of energy put out by the sun, PV solar cells use only about a third of the available spectrum and then the very best give a 25% max. output efficiency.Poor quality spray on silicon can be as low as 6%, I know, I have one, it puts out 100 watts max and takes more 50% more space than a better quality 250 watt one.A 250 watt cell that takes up 1 square metre is 25% efficient.Some of the old cadmium telluride ones were even less efficient and old cells fall away as they age.The above map shows where Solar technologies work best, the red,orange and yellow areas.The American inventor, Frank Shuman, proved all this at Maadi, Egypt in 1912-1913. Shuman’s plant used parabolic troughs to power a 60-70 horsepower engine that pumped 6,000 gallons of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields.After running his plant for 4 years he was able to release the following statement,“We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun.”— Frank Shuman, New York Times, July 2, 1916.Because all this is based on technology available in 1910 or earlier it is ideally suited to low tech countries with limited fabrication capabilities, such as Australia.Practical examples of electricity generating plants, of Concentrated Solar Thermal with and without the more expensive Molten Salt Thermal Storage option, exist from :The SEGS installation at Daggett, in Southern California, which is a 9 farm 350MW facility installed and running from 1984 to the present. This has no storage but uses heated oil as the transfer medium to run steam generators. It must be reaching the end of its life but could be converted to hot oil or solid block storage. Because of the more aged infrastructure this type of system may need to use a more expensive copper or aluminium storage battery.Through the generating and thermal storage plants at Andasol, at Andalusia, in Spain, is a 3 farm 150MW faciloity with 7.5 hours of Molten salt storage at each farm, it began operation over the period 2007 to 2011.TL:DRAnd the cheapest way to gain almost unlimited amounts of fusion energy?Up to 50,000 times more than our current total energy usage?From the sun! Every sunny day! Its supplied free and if stored thermally, costs about 2 to 3 cents per KWH in store, storage cost amortised over 10 years.No expensive lithium batteries, just pure heat at 500 degrees, ready to go into existing Coal, Gas or Nuclear power stations.This works best between the 40th parallels of latitude, it just gets a little harder as you go towards the poles. :)Suited to low tech countries with limited fabrication capabilities./TL:DRA good deal of the above information was supplied by Wikipedia to whom I am eternally grateful.If you find the above Info interesting or useful, pass it on to others. and upvote or share it.Version o.8ßc 20190608 09:40AM Australian Central Standard TimeThis is a work in progress, it represents 10 years of partime work and research.I submit it for publication because there seems no other way of storage.","220,146 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.3M,14.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-get-energy-from-nuclear-fusion

Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which produces a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount ofThe problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Heavy Lift Pure Fusion Rockets for MarsA thermonuclear pure fusion rocket can follow the same approach as was suggested for Orion-type nuclear fission explosive rockets through a series of controlled limited yield peaceful fusion explosive bursts. Being pure fusion devices without any nuclear fission component, such Peaceful Fusion Nuclear Explosives (PFNE) powered rockets would produce no radioactive fallout in the earth’s atmosphere. PFNE powered rockets producing a hydrogen plasma jet velocity of 30 km/s could make it possible to reach the orbital speed of 8 km/s using just one fusion rocket stage, instead of several hundred multi-stage chemical rockets, while assembling a large Mars rocket in low earth orbit. At an exhaust velocity of 30 km/s using 1 ton of Deuterium (hydrogen isotope) fusion fuel per second would produce 3000 tons of thrust.(picture of aA pure fusion nuclear rocket powered by the D-D fusion reaction could be designed to use only non-radioactive fusion fuel (Deuterium) and produce only non-radioactive nuclear waste (Helium-4) and some neutrons. If a pure fusion rocket were to blow up on the launch pad it would release principally only non-radioactive Deuterium and non-radioactive Helium-4.ConclusionThe feasibility of the proposed pure fusion propulsion concept would be of great significance for the future of space flight. It does not require a large number of chemical rockets to bring the parts of a Mars craft, for example, into low-earth orbit. Using only chemical rockets would not require multiple multistage chemical rocket launches and a Mars rocket assembly crew working in the weightless vacuum of space.

You can’t achieve anything like the plasma densities that exist in the core of the Sun, which is also much cooler than the typical temperatures employed in the plasma in fusion reactor designs on Earth.You can’t do it, that is, except by employing absolutely extraordinary methods, such as in thermonuclear weapons, where the explosion of a small fission weapon is usedTo make fusion on Earth, as opposed to how it happens in the Sun, where gravity does most of the necessary work, you need to have very high temperatures to get sufficiently high reaction rates for a fusion reactor to be practical. You can’t achieve anything like the plasma densities that exist in the core of the Sun, which is also much cooler than the typical temperatures employed in the plasma in fusion reactor designs on Earth.You can’t do it, that is, except by employing absolutely extraordinary methods, such as in thermonuclear weapons, where the explosion of a small fission weapon is used to cause an implosion and very strong compression and heating and ignition of a mass of fusion fuel, which then burns very rapidly. This method, though it works, is obviously not ideal for power generation. You want something much more controlled, and more steady to produce power stably and efficiently.But the necessary high temperatures make that control extremely hard to accomplish, because high temperature plasma is very strongly driven to expand, and if it does expand then the fusion reactions turn off.The underlying physical reason that high temperature and density are required is that nuclei repel each other due to their positive charge, and they must be forced close enough together in order for the strong force to act, so that fusion reactions can occur. A way around this called muon catalysed fusion has been proposed, but it has not been made practical as yet.So far, the continuous fusion reactors, based on magnetic confinement of the plasma, haven’t been able to overcome plasma instabilities. While fusion can be created it has proven to be very hard to contain the plasma for long enough to be even close to making a practical reactor.It is similarly the case with pulsed fusion reactors based on inertial confinement, driven either by lasers or by heavy ion beams. They haven’t, yet, demonstrated a sufficiently positive energy return for a practical fusion power plant, even though it is definitely possible to create some fusion reactions by these methods.It’s simply a technically very hard problem.The only successful approach to producing large amounts of energy from fusion so far has been the explosion of thermonuclear bombs, and there are fairly obvious reasons why people don’t want to explode lots of thermonuclear weapons in order to try to generate electric power, though this has actually been proposed in a fairly serious way, using fission weapons. It was proposed to explode small fission bombs deep underground in large cavities, and to use the energy released to heat water into steam, or possibly even to use some other working fluid.The program was called PACER and it came out of research at LLNL. The idea was probably kicked around already at Los Alamos. For small fission weapons it was fairly easy to show that it couldn’t be done economically - it was much cheaper and obviously much safer at 1970’s uranium prices just to burn uranium in standard thermal nuclear power reactors.If you wanted to use fusion bombs there is the comprehensive test ban treaty in place, which would forbid even trying such ideas experimentally - you would have to get around that for a start. And so far fusion bombs are very big in yield, and all of them require a fission primary, which is a major complication due to the radioactivity of the fission products.",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777K,26.0,https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-take-to-make-radical-breakthroughs-quickly-in-fusion-energy-technology

The small Israeli reactor was spherical in shape and was powered by a solution of Am-242(NO3)3 in water. When a fission reactor is very small in size (<10 cm radius sphere) it requires relatively less combined shielding to fully enclose the reactor with an adequate gamma and neutron shield. Really small fission reactors become much more practical if good light weight and compact shielding approaches are used.The minimal critical mass (water reflected) that can be formed is 6.6 g of Am-242m.Los Alamos has recent experience building quite small nuclear reactors using many off the shelf components to reduce cost. LANL is currently testing their kilowatt power space fission reactor called KRUSTY (KilowattSmall fusion reactors for providing power tend to be discounted because no one has recently produced a fusion reactor that actually generates net power.Fusion has however many significant advantages for truly small nuclear power generation applications -Some advantages of fusion for building truly small reactors.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) are the most abundant elements in the universe, fully 10^10 times more abundant than any combination of fission fuels.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Fast Neutrons are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield than penetrating fission produced gammas.While pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has worked since 1952) producing fusion power reliably on demand[2].Proton-Boron-11 fusion is a current interest for the fusion community. p-B11 fusion produces primarily alpha-particles which are easy to shield and have attractive intrinsic safety features for human operators - all of which is vital for a small reactor application. While p-B11 is expected to produce a few neutrons through side reactors, this style of fusion is a good candidate for safely powering small reactor applications.Inertial Confinement Fusion of p-B11 fuel for small reactor applicationsIt has been calculated that ion temperatures of DT ignited targets reach very high values, exceeding 200 keV. This is the temperature above which proton-boron 11 fusion reactivity arrives to high enough levels to be relevant for energy production (and to obtain high fusion energy gain). In the same DT explosion wave, electron temperatures remain at a lower value, usually below 100 keV, which is a helpful feature to reduce radiation and conduction losses from the plasma. A scheme can be devised to exploit proton-boron 11 fusion by using an Inertial Confinement staged fusion device design initiating a controlled fusion deflagration wave in a p-B11 fusion secondary stage while using a much smaller DT spark primary stage. This maximizes the production of fusion energy from p-B11 while reducing the size and cost of the required ICF fusion driver (laser or particle beam).[1] - Y.

These are (a) inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and (b) magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). Beside these we can define the group of miscellaneous concepts which contains electrostatic confinement, and hybrid concepts of MCF and ICF.Besides the distinction in technologies to create fusion there is a coarse distinction in the type of fusion, namely, neutronic and aneutronic fusion. Neutronic fusion means that primarily excess neutrons carry the energy of the fusion reaction and aneutronic fusion means that primarily excess charged particles carry the energy.Inertial confinementA problem with both the Z-machine and the NIF is not being able to have repeated shots, due to the huge power requirements per shot (for both) and the physical limitations of the liners (Z-machine) and the current lasers (NIF). During the coming years NIF is doing a proof-of-concept for nuclear fusion by laser-assisted inertial confinement. Depending on the developments at NIF, HIPER will be constructed in 2028.It provides a different angle for plasma research than controlled fusion which could be used in for instance plasma accelerator development, high energy laser development and tracking technologies.Magnetic confinementThe Tokamak design has been built since the 1950's in various forms and since then the performance numbers have exponentially increased in time with increased size of the reactors and with evolving operating regimes.With project ITER the reactor size is again increased and the expected increase in performance should lead to a net gain in energy over longer confinement times (in the order of minutes). This should take place between 2025-2030. If successful, a follow-up reactor will be built to demonstrate final application as a power plant, between 2045-2055.This is the most costly project so far, but also the one in which the most experience has been built up, systematically and rigourously. The major uncertainty is the quality of the superconducting coils which will only have a cold-test before they are integrated in the final assembly. The established design being worked on today assumes a so-called high-confinement mode (H-mode) as the operating regime. This mode was accidentally discovered in the early eighties during experiments at ASDEX in Germany. However it is accompanied by instabilities at the edge of the plasma (ELM's) which for ITER-sized reactors would lead to destructive heat fluxes going towards the walls, unless the instabilities are continuously mitigated or controlled.In the Tokamak reactor the helical field lines which hold the plasma together are formed by an induced current and toroidal field coils. This current drive is also the cause of many instabilities. In theCategory C, the smaller experimentsAn example of an IEC is the polywell by EMC2. The latest design by EMC2 (the WB8) is still being tested, if successful a 100 MW-design will follow and an aneutronic version o f the WB8 design. A major issue with polywells is their inefficiency to produce fusion reactions due to electron leakage.As an example of FRC, a company called Tri-alpha is developing a magnetic-mirror concept to facilitate aneutronic fusion, it has gathered over $100 million from private investors. The magnetic mirror machine is potentially much simpler and much smaller than the Tokamak-designs. An important advantage is the  fact the fusion products are charged and can thus be used directly to generate electric energy, and since it is charged it can be manipulated using magnetic fields. The charged fusion products can for instance be focussed to create a compact direct power conversion. Important downside is leakage of particles due to the open field line through the center, reducing the efficiency.Focus fusion plasma holds some promise to produce efficient fusion power, however it's reliance on instabilities to generate enough plasma energy/density make it difficult to develop into a continuous and stable energy source, also it is unclear how and if this design can be scaled up to produce net energy.Hybrid concepts: for instance the one by General Fusion, which entails the use of hundreds of cylinders impinging on a single point (equally timed within microseconds) to compress rotating liquid lithium and liquid Lead through shockwaves onto a magnetically confined D-T plasma vortex which is shot into the cavity of the sphere. Here the lithium acts as the Tritium source and energy is transferred through the liquid heating up and expanding. Difficulties are mostly of engineering nature, the problems experienced by magnetic confinement fusion are of less importance here because the confinement time is kept very small. This is called Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF), here a plasmoid of low density is compressed to obtain the require confinement time for fusion.The hybrid concept MagLIF is a combination of a Z-pinch machine and a laser based confinement system. The basic mode of operation is as follows, first a magnetically confined plasma of deuterium and tritium is generated in a Hohlraum using a high-power laser, then the Hohlraum is pinched (i.e. compressed) by a current shot. Again, just as with the Z-machine, and the NIF, repeated shots are very difficult due to excessive heat loads on the liners, which carry the huge currentshots in the order of 50 million amperes.Another concept is a hybrid fusion/fission reactor, where part of the output energy is delivered by a fission reaction which is catalyzed by the high energy neutrons from the fusion reactions. This way fissionable material can be used without producing much (if any) nuclear waste.The major difficulties for sustained energy production, for both inertial and magnetic confinement are; (I) material degradation and activation due to neutron fluency [especially for neutronic fusion], (II) pollution control, (III) maintenance and specifically for magnetic confinement; continuous control of the plasma dynamics and prevention of damaging instabilities (IV).(I) Neutron fluency destabilizes wall materials to produce short-lived radioactive waste, and due to transmutation actually change the element type, Wolfram for instance can change to Lead. A possible solution that is being experimented with now is the use of liquid lithium flowing over the reactor walls.(II) How do we insert fuel without creating too much disturbance and how do we get rid of the fusion products efficiently.(III) As said, especially for neutronic fusion the wall will be radioactive and maintenance of the components inside the reactor will require special robotic tools.(IV) Confinement time is one of the most important performance indicators of any experimental magnetic confinement fusion reactor. It requires control systems which can (predictively) respond accurately within milliseconds and continuous monitoring of all the relevant plasma parameters. The relatively low density of the plasma requires relatively long confinement times for there to be enough collisions. This requirement of long confinement time is the most limiting factor for MCF, regardless of whether the reaction is neutronic or aneutronic.Aneutronic fusion requires much higher temperatures and it is likely less stable in terms of plasma dynamics due to the heavier Boron ions. However, a pure aneutronic fusion reaction will not (radio)activate and degrade the wall, it will open up the possibility for direct power conversion as well as magnetic control over the expelled fusion products since they are charged.Superconducting coilsI mention this separately because technological developments in this area are not only crucial for the viability of magnetic confinement fusion, they are also partly detached from the fusion plasma research in the sense that maximizing the maximum magnetic field that can be generated is a goal in itself.There are two recent developments of interest for this topic:I personally have no doubt that we will harness fusion energy. In terms of technology it is not a matter of possible or impossible but rather of perseverance, boldness and expediency. Expediency, because nuclear fusion is likely to require more time to reach full potential then for instance solar or wind energy which are already being put to market. So there is a risk of the public and politics losing interest and thus of funding being cut away from the big projects like ITER and HIPER. In the mean time a lot of private investment capital is being spent on experimental, say category (c), concepts which hold promise of success but certainly do not give guarantees. This requires boldness now, and especially in the future if these concepts do not immediately live up to expectations. Perseverance because the concept of nuclear fusion is by far superior to wind or solar in terms of the technology gained and the ecological footprint it leaves.Please add/edit.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/How-compact-can-we-make-a-nuclear-power-generator

The plant is down for months doing this. That’s the bad news. The good news is that this is a scheduled outage, likely performed at a time of the year when less power is needed (eg spring or fall), and so the grid operators can plan around the outage.Oh, there is another reason you have to replace the most-used solid fuel assemblies every so often. Let’s face it, being a fuel pellet in a running reactor is not the most gentle way to pass your time. You crack because of thermal stresses and because of single atoms of uranium being replaced by two atoms of fission product taking up more space and making the fuel swell. Being the cladding holding the fuel pellets in place is not a gentle way to make a living either. So quite aside from the amount of fissionable material dropping to levels which are too low, the fuel assemblies have to be replaced before the cladding degrades.So that’s why today’s nuclear power reactors must be shut down periodically thus giving them a capacity factor of about 90%.Oh, BTW, solar and wind have capacity factors which, on average, are about 25% and 33% depending on where they are placed.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,404 followers",Michael Karnerfors,587,4.6K,9.2M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-nuclear-fusion-based-reactors

Nuclear fission can provide both.  How to make electricity with reactors is well known, so I'll concentrate on propulsion.Short answer:Long answer:The rocket equation tells usWhat exhaust velocity is fission capable of?  The nuclear-thermal rockets mentioned above all use heat from a reactor to accelerate a gas propellant.  Naturally, the heavier the propellant, the slower it will exit the rocket when heated by a given amount.  Hence, lightweight hydrogen gas is often chosen.But the revolutionary dusty plasma reactor of Sheldon & ClarkThoriumTo burn thorium directly we need to use fast neutrons.  It should be possible to run a nuclear-thermal rocket on fast neutrons (though we might need to swap the hydrogen propellant for helium, since the former gas is a neutron moderator).  The dusty plasma reactor is generally assumed to run on slow neutrons, since then the plasma can be made much smaller.  To burn thorium with slow neutrons we first need to transmute (""breed"") it into uranium-233.

He3 doesn't occur on Earth, so it would have to be bred in flight.  And the D-He3 reaction is very hard to achieve.So fusion has some promise, but unlike fission-powered rockets, we don't yet have the technology to make it work.* Assuming 100% engine efficiency, a one-way fission-powered trip on the ISS to Proxima Centauri would take ~ 40 years and require 25kt U-235.

1,"He-3 fusion does have some advantages.Fusion reactions produce easier to shield radiation than the penetrating gamma radiation produced by most forms of nuclear fission.

The more common neutron fusion reactions like Deuterium-Tritium (DT) or Deuterium-Deuterium (DD) produce energetic neutrons that while dangerous, can be blocked by relatively light and relatively inexpensive materials like Borated High Density Polyethylene Plastic, which can be conveniently cast into custom shapes as needed to safely shield a neutron producing fusion reactor.There are also aneutronic fusion reactions that occur at higher temperatures and plasma pressures like p-B11 and D-He3 that produce charged particles like protons or alpha particles instead of neutrons. Charged particles like protons can be efficiently collected on screens and plates and used to directly produce electricity by magneto-hydrodynamic energy converters at very high efficiencies and with no moving parts to wear out. At least one current fusion experiment, Dense Plasma Focus fusion at LPP Fusion , has achieved the high temperatures and confinement times needed to produce aneutronic fusion (LPP Fusion is currently working on improving plasma pressure - the last condition it needs to satisfy to achieve the requirements for aneutronic fusion). Fission ignited Fusion also can reach the fusion triple-product needed to produce aneutronic fusion (but no fusion experiments with aneutronic fuels were ever conducted by Test program to my knowledge).Even if you achieve the extreme simultaneous requirements for D-He3 or He3-He3 fusion, fusion cross sections and fusion reaction rates for neutron producing fusion reactions like D-T and D-D fusion are much more attractive, by many orders of magnitude, than for the He3 reactions.A graph of fusion reaction cross section for different fusion reactions versus temperature (keV)-The D-He3 reaction has better fusion reaction rates at lower temperatures, but it is not totally aneutronic and still produces some fast 14.1 MeV neutrons that have to be shielded to provide operator safety.It may not be necessary to go to the moon to obtain secure supplies of He-3Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation (fusion powered ships, planes, trains, cars, and rockets to the stars).The fusion reaction that has the best fusion reaction rates at temperatures we know how to produce in machines we know how to build is the followingD + He3 -> He-4 + proton (18.3 MeV energy) (aneutronic)The reaction rates for D+He3 fusion is comparable to D-D fusion, and the D+He3 fusion reaction has the advantage of producing mostly charged protons that are easy to shield and easy to use to directly convert fusion energy into electrical energy at high efficiency.In the space advocacy community, it is not uncommon to encounter supporters of going to the moon to obtain He3 fuel. What is generally not mentioned is the fact that it may be possible to manufacture He3 more cheaply on earth by tuning D-D fusion reactors to produce both energy and He3 fuel as they operate while burning ubiquitous Deuterium fuel obtained from sea water.Terrestrially rare He3 can potentially be produced in stationary earth bound D-D fusion reactor that operates with the fusion side-chain suppressed that normally burns He3 in situ.The D-D fusion reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:D + D	→ T	+ 1HD + D	→ 3He	+ nBy properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVSince He3 reactions occur at higher temperatures and plasma pressures, it should be possible to configure a D-D fusion reactor to operate just below the conditions needed to burn He3 at high reaction rates and make such a D-D fusion reactor an He3 fuel manufacturing facility.Most fusion analysts only consider the D + He3 fusion reaction among He3 fuel burning fusion reactions because it has among the highest fusion reaction rates of aneutronic fusion reactions. It might be valuable, however, to mention another aneutronic He-3 fusion reaction that has several exceptional characteristics that may one day make it very important.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).What are some of the characteristics of He3-He3 fusion that makes it exceptional?Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Collecting He3 from D-D fusion reactors adjusted to suppress He3 fusion allows this He3 aneutronic fusion fuel to be produced significantly more cheaply than going into space for it.Inertial Confinement Fusion operates using by far the highest density fusion plasma and this is significant from the standpoint of building a small and economic power reactor. The power that can be drawn from a burning plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the square of the density of the fusion plasma. The denser the fusion plasma, the more energy that can be extracted from it.Inertial Confinement Fusion power plants that employ He3-He3 fusion could be small if desired (both in physical size and in power output). Teaming stationary D-D fusion reactors tuned to produce energy and He3 fuel with smaller mobile reactors burning He3 aneutronic fuel for fusion transportation applications would cover a large portion of mankind’s need for reliable and clean energy and could usher in an exciting new technical age and an end to worldwide energy scarcity and poverty that typically results from lack of access to energy.Sometime within the next decade we should see experimentally whether a tuned ICF D-D fusion reactor using abundant and cheap non-radioactive Deuterium separated from the world's oceans is capable of producing significant quantities of He-3 fuel which can be scavenged from the debris left in the evacuated ICF fusion chamber following a power producing fusion shot.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Could-thorium-reactors-be-used-for-space-travel

199,That is very simple to be understood. To make fusion work you need to force all hydrogen atoms to be close to each other up to the point that hydrogen will combine with other hydrogen to form helium. You can do that by a high pressure environment or high temperature created by the fission of an uranium or plutonium atomic bomb. These neutrons works like a glue connecting protons inside the nucleus. The energy is liberated when some particles are fused to become helium liberating neutrinos and gama rays. An environment with electromagnetic energy like laser may also work out.That is very simple to be understood.

Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion or ""alpha particles"" produced from p-B11 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield.

It's simply an energy density issue -- galvanic cell batteriesElectricity cost barely impacts this -- liquid hydrocarbons are just outright superior to batteries for transport applications. Energy density is king. It's more about physics than economics.And without such a massive global shift to electric cars, electricity generation really doesn't impact the oil/gas industry. That means fusion power is completely irrelevant to half the world's primary energy production.Fusion Doesn't Mean FreeFirst off, any sane company would charge only slightly less for fusion power than we currently pay for existing electricity sources. It's simple profit motive -- you charge the most you can while still capturing market share. But even if by sheer philanthropy theElectricity will never be zero-cost.And that would be a lovely price to pay for electricity,Consider the golden days of nuclear fission plant construction. Pro-nuclear activists claimed the power would be ""too cheap to meter"" and they weren't too far off. Power from an early nuclear plant -- before activist opposition and post-Chernobyl safety precautions increased costs -- was only about $0.02-0.04/kWh, adjusted for inflation. The US started a massive reactor construction program that churned out power plants fast enough to transform the face of US energy production. It dwarfed the scale of today's renewables growth. And did the world change? I would say there was a resounding ""Don't get me wrong, cheaper energy is awesome. If electricity becomes free at the point of generation but still costs money to transmit, lots of thingsAvailabilityIt pains me to admit it, but many studies show minimal long-term impact on developed nations from higher energy costs. Studies vary on this subject but the point is, the effect isn't enormous. In modern service-oriented economies, high energy costs primarily manifest as a negative impact on the inflation rate and growth rate. Again, cheaper energy is awesome, but it isn't world-changing. TAnd there would be some waste, too. People would set their thermostats lower in summer. People would buy electric heaters instead of high-efficiency heat pumps. More lights would stay on when no one's in the room. Electric kettles would be left on all day to keep the water hot for tea.

Fusion reactors are simply a better way of generating electricity in a world that is hungry for more and more electricity every year. Any device that can meet that demand, even partially, without adding to the ongoing problems of air/carbon/greenhouse gas pollution and nuclear waste IS, in fact, world changing.Before I begin, let’s define what fusion IS and what it IS NOT so that we’re operating from a solid foundation. I’ll begin with the definition from Encyclopedia Britannica:In other words, fusion is a source of electricity. It is NOT ‘free energy’ and no one is claiming that it is.NOW let’s look at the (widely accepted) ADVANTAGES OF FUSION ENERGY:Fusion Energy Foundation Goals, Initiatives and AdvantagesBut don’t take my word for it:Ok, now we know that we’re talking about something simple - electricity - so let's take his arguments point by point and I'll explain why he is incorrect.1.) Fusion Doesn’t Mean SmallCOUNTERPOINT:2.) ""COUNTERPOINT:Fusion is an energy source, not a propulsion system. Any attempt to compare the two is wrong from the get-go. Fusion reactors don’t NEED to be small enough to cram into an automobile in order to change the world. They only need to produce clean electrical energy. From there that energy can be delivered to homes, businesses and charging stations that can/will/are used to power electrical vehicles. As the automobile fleets of the world transition to electrical vehicles the need for clean abundant energy will increase year upon year. Fusion can help meet that demand by replacing aging coal-fired and traditional fission power plants thus nullifying their negative environmental impacts, i.e. nuclear accidents (Fukushima, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl) and carbon (a typical coal plant emits between 7,000 and 14,000 tons of carbon per year.To put it more simply, to change the world fusion reactors need only to replace coal-fired and nuclear fission power plants. The dirtiest and most dangerous sources of power. Even if that’s ALL they did that would be enough to ‘change the world’.BUT that’s not the end of this counterpoint! Lockheed Martin is presently developing a compact fusion reactor that is “small enough to fit on a truck"" (their words). From their site: ""A reactor small enough to fit on a truck could provide enough power for a small city of up to 100,000 people.”Compact Fusion2.)COUNTERPOINT:Putting cars and trucks aside for a moment, the U.S. Navy is already powering fleets of ships and submarines using small-scale nuclear reactors - so it CAN be done on ships, subs and in aircraft. Replacing those fission reactors with small-scale fusion reactors is not only technically feasible it’s preferable from a strategic standpoint as the fuel source for fusion reactors, deuterium, is derived from seawater.Speaking of ships, according to a 2009 report by The Guardian, in one year a single large container ship can emit pollution equivalent to that generated by 50 MILLION cars.Health risks of shipping pollution have been 'underestimated'The civilian shipping industry burns anywhere from 250 million to 300 million TONS of bunker fuel per year to accommodate the needs of our global economy. Bunker fuel is 1,000 times dirtier than highway diesel used in automobiles. Because of this, the shipping industry generates between 10 and 30 percent of global atmospheric pollution depending on how you calculate the numbers. Replacing even 10% of those ships with fusion powered nuclear ships would not only save billions in annual fuel expenditures for shipping companies but it would reduce the pollution output of the industry by tens of thousands of tons of carbon per year. I’d call that world changing.3.) Fusion Doesn’t Mean FreeCOUNTERPOINT:No one ever said power has to be ‘free’ to ‘change the world.’ What we’re talking about here is a  clean, safe, abundant energy source. What we pay for that will be worked out by the economics. In other words, that ‘problem’ if you want to call it that - will sort itself out as fusion finds its footing in a rapidly diversifying energy infrastructure. It will have to eventually compete with solar and wind and consumers will have a choice of where their power comes from and how much they pay for it will be determined by the marketplace.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Coal might continue to be worth producing for a decade or so during the transition and for export to developing nations that will have to wait for the technology to become more mainstream, but a working proof-of-concept fusion plant will be coal's final death knell.Petroleum producers and refiners will probably fare much better for the medium term; gasoline and diesel aren't going anywhere without significant improvements in either electrolytic charge storage capacity or portable high-efficiency fuel cell technology.  Transportation usage alone makes up 68% of petroleum consumption in the United States. A further 25% is used industrially, and it's unclear what the divide is between use of the petroleum chemicals themselves for polymer production (which fusion power wouldn't replace), and burning the stuff for heat such as in metal refining/recycling (grid power can be used for this kind of work, but large changes in existing petroleum-fired smelters would be needed). About 5.8% is used for residential and commercial heating/cooking needs, where a significant investment would be needed for a switchover to all-electric (and loss of gas cooktops would be resisted by foodies), while only 1.4% of U.S. petroleum consumption is for grid electricity.However, with grid power becoming insanely cheap over a few decades, the industrial sector would likely take steps to reduce petroleum consumption for industrial heating, and even if industrial use were cut by half and all other sources remained the same, we'd likely see a price collapse in petroleum as demand from the biggest bulk consumers would disappear rapidly. That will lead to abandonment of the lowest-margin oil production projects, like the tar sands, as the price decline makes those unprofitable. That will cost jobs in the short term during a transition from petroleum production to fusion fuel production (building and running water electrolysis plants, mostly).Something tells me that production of the fuel used by the plant, probably hydrogen isotopes, is not considered into the energy costs of the plant. We could use renewables, like solar and wind, to run hydrogen production plants. That could lead to increased development of renewable sources, but depending on the margins of energy consumption to production that this new plant could provide, the plant might do better than breakeven even if it were electrolyzing its own fuel. If that's the case, we'll likely abandon all other forms of energy production including renewables, which will cost R&D and construction jobs in those sectors.In summary, the biggest losers will be those who are unable to adapt to change, as has always been the case. The typewriter replaced dozens of hand copyists requiring perfect penmanship with a couple dozen typists able to produce a completely legible document in a fraction of the time of hand copying. So, if you wanted to stay employed, you learned to type. The photostatic copier (Xerox machine) in turn replaced the typing pool with just one or two secretaries, so if you wanted to stay employed, you had to find something else to do where your typing skills were valued for something beyond rote copying of documents.","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

It's certainly not a working physical prototype. It's certainly not a production prototype. It's certainly not a commercial product available from Lockheed for construction and installation as another form of grid power. It's certainly not a product that is certified to be safe. It's not an insurable product. No environmental assessments for a fusion reactor in a production grid have ever been done. No data is available on stability, power quality, reliability or even little things like wattage. No grid management studies exist on plugging the the thing in. There aren't factories somewhere waiting to churn these things out, and there are no supply chains and companies in place to distribute, construct and operate them. There is no operational history for anyone to look at to assess true risks and costs and make informed decisions about inclusion in their generation purchasing strategies or not.All of those things must occur before it can have any significant impact on the world. If everything goes insanely well and their concept actually works, it will probably be 30 years before all of the above is actually true about it.And in 30 years, wind and solar power will be so thoroughly dominant at such lower costs and with so much lower concerns about massive liabilities if the devices should catastrophically fail that there's no reason to believe that fusion will be competitive. In 30 years, nuclear generation in total will have diminished further than it already is, having been in world wide decline in absolute and relative terms for almost a decade already as of 2014. In 30 years, the ongoing disruption of grid management and operation organizations -- the classic utilities -- by renewables will have continued. Who pays for transmission and how will have been solved, so net-metering fights will be over. Fusion will just be another option in a transformed grid, and undoubtedly not the cheapest, safest and most broadly deployable one.In other words, fusion might have changed the world if we had made it viable 30 years ago, but if it finally becomes viable at scale it will be at a point when it's fairly irrelevant.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

Also, it’s fuel is generally not highly radioactive (perhaps some tritium is involved). The whole thing is therefore a lot cleaner in that respect.Both fusion and fission reactors will irradiate their containment vessels, and render then radioactive to some extent, but even then the fission reactor will be a lot worse.nb.

10,"Yes, as a matter of fact, it does. There are two sources: the primary, a fission bomb that starts the fusion burn in the secondary, and a sparkplug and optional uranium tamper which both fission. The secondary itself may have leftover tritium from the secondary burn; that’s lightly radioactive as well.The sparkplug is a rod of plutonium or U-235 running down the middle of the secondary which, when fissioned by neutrons from the primary, squeezes the secondary to the necessary fusion pressure.","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most
11,"Yes, nuclear fusion releases harmful ionizing radiation.In the “typical” tokomak fusion device, deuterium and tritium (hydrogen with 1 and 2 extra neutrons, respectively) are forced to fuse in a high-energy plasma cloud that is energized and contained by magnetic fields, releasing a total of ~17 Mev in energy, mostly as a high-speed neutron.

Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for small fusion reactor applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a fusion-electric car or other small fusion application (Iron Man Suit?). Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).The energy required from a fusion driver to successfully ignite small sub-gram DT ICF fusion capsules has been experimentally shown[1] to be about 20 MJ delivered to a 2mm spot in less than 3 nanoseconds. 20 MJ is the amount of energy released when burning 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline. The requirements of He3-He3 fuson are expected to be about 40X requirements for DT ICF fusion.Will there ever be small fusion reactors directly powering fusion cars, planes, rockets, and even power tools?Perhaps not in the near term.Small fusion reactors with low shielding requirements powered by He3-He3 aneutronic fusion will probably arise at some point in our future. The style of fusion device most likely to support this style of fusion is Inertial Confinement Fusion.[1] - Cold war Halite-Centurion Field Tests at the Nevada Test SiteNY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests - Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among ScientistsSecret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among ScientistsThe following document contains what John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE""Development of the Indirect drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain."" John Lindl. Page: 3937. AIP Physics of Plasma. American Institute of Physics, 14 June 1995.http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/Sha...Fusion Rocketry -At some point fusion rockets are almost certain to be built.Fusion nuclear fuels are 10^11 times more prevalent in the universe as any combination of fission nuclear fuels. If you want to explore the universe and go where no one else has gone, it is better to use nuclear fusion rather than chemical rockets or nuclear fission based rockets.Using an aneutronic fusion fuel cycle like p-B11 is not required for astronaut safety. Fast neutrons from DD and DT fusion can be safely shielded with only modest spacecraft mass penaltyTo reduce the radiation hazard for manned missions to Mars and beyond, a high-specific-impulse –high-thrust system is needed. Such system could be produced by a repeated serial burst inertial confinement pure fusion propulsion system.Igniting fusion fuels in discrete controlled pure fusion thermonuclear bursts would require a compact pure fusion driver (laser or ion beam) capable of delivering around 20 MJ of energy focused into a 2mm diameter spot within less than 2 to 3 nanoseconds. Convenient scalable pure fusion energy from a repeated serial burst ICF system can be achieved using a hybrid two-stage DT-DD fusion capsule. The primary first stage of the hybrid two-stage fusion target uses a half gram of the easiest to ignite Deuterium-Tritium fuel. The secondary stage consists of a long thin tapered cylinder that holds cryo-deuterium liquid under great static pressure. Ignition is achieved via a laser or light-ion particle beam fusion driver which ignites the small spherical DT primary and produces a shock ignited thermonuclear detonation wave in the compressed deuterium liquid in the slightly tapered cylindrical secondary. The length of the cylindrical secondary can be arbitrarily long and the yield of the device can be conveniently tuned to any desired yield over a wide range. To avoid a large radiator, needed to remove the heat from the absorption of the fast neutrons in the spacecraft, the microexplosion is surrounded by a thick layer of liquid hydrogen, stopping the neutrons and heating the hydrogen to a temperature of ∼ 10^5 K, which as a fully ionized plasma can be repelled from the spacecraft by a magnetic mirror.While both DD and DT fusion produces neutrons, the problem of neutron shielding required to provide safety for astronauts and Mars colonists while on their 30 day or less transit to a destination like Mars can be accomplished by constructing the spacecraft along the lines of the 2001 Space Odyssey Discovery spacecraft. The Discovery was a very long spacecraft that separated by a long distance the forward spherical crew section from the fusion nuclear engines at the rear. The solid angle required to completely shield astronauts from neutron radiation is small and the mass of shielding required is relatively small. Effective shielding for high energy DT and DD fusion neutrons can be arranged in a two stage process.In DT fusion, about 80% of the fusion energy is released into fast neutrons while in DD fusion 66% of the energy of fusion is released into neutrons. Fast neutrons from DT and DD fusion cannot be deflected by a nozzle formed as a magnetic mirror. Still worse, the neutrons would heat the spacecraft, which then would requires a large radiator to dissipate heat into space. This problem can be addressed by surrounding the neutron-releasing DT-DD fusion burst with a sufficiently thick layer of surrounding liquid hydrogen. This layer greatly reduces the energy of the fast neutrons which are then be absorbed by the boron-carbide layer of the fusion nozzle. The heating the thick layer of hydrogen to the high temperatures would cause it to become a fully ionized plasma, which could be deflected by a magnetic mirror. The alpha particles of the DT-DD thermonuclear reactions are stopped at a distance much smaller than the fast neutrons in the boron-carbide face of the fusion rocket nozzle.The first stage shielding then uses the thick layer of liquid hydrogen. Materials composed of light low Z elements slow neutrons primarily via elastic scattering. Collisions of neutrons with nuclei similar in mass to that of a neutron transfer more energy per scatter than collisions with heavy nuclei, and so require fewer scattering events for the same energy loss. The neutrons are then fully absorbed and stopped in the layer of boron-carbide facing the fusion rocket nozzle and the rear of the spacecraft. Supplementary radiation shielding along the critical solid angle between the fusion rocket engines and the astronaut crew compartment can be supplied by storing crew drinking water in such a way as to block and absorb neutrons before they enter the crew compartment.At some point more advanced fusion reactions like He3-He3 and P-B11 will be used that release their energy primarily as charged particles (protons and charged alpha particles). In the case of advanced fusion reactions that produce few (or no) neutrons, a magnetic nozzle can be used to direct thrust away from the rocket.Drawing of a pulsed magnetic nozzle used to protect a fusion rocket emitting charged particles like protons or alpha particles from hot plasma exhaust.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)",3 followers,Amogh Joshi,6.5K,359,3.3M,15.0,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

Shockingly, they lived together out of wedlock and she was ostracized by society.In Switzerland, she was a guest of Lord Byron’s and on one gloomy, rainy day, Lord Byron proposed a challenge to his bored guests: everyone would write a ghost story and they would all decide the winner.While the men quickly lost interest in the project, Mary created Frankenstein, a work that would change the face of English literature.I know there is going to be a bit of backlash on this answer so here’s a quote by Isaac Asimov, a prolific writer who popularized the science fiction genre.“Mary Shelley was the first to make use of a new finding of science which she advanced further to a logical extreme, and it is that which makes",2 followers,Rui Silva,3.4K,9.2K,44.3M,23.0,https://www.quora.com/Does-nuclear-fusion-release-harmful-radiation-like-fission-does

ITER is a very large, very expensive laboratory experiment, not a prototype power reactor. It is expected to be completed around 2025. Then 10 years of plasma experiments before it attempts fusion around 2035. Already you can see why ITER will have no significant impact on the current roll-out of wind and solar projects.If ITER is successful in producing aDEMO will be (at this stage) 15% larger than ITER and is expected maybe 2048 (the expected dates seem to be slipping backwards at about the rate of one year per year).DEMO is still not a commercial nuclear fusion power plant.

I wouldn’t be.However, even if nuclear fusion power is not an answer in the short term or even medium term, could it be a solution some time after 2050? Personally, I doubt it.This is theNote this plant is complete with turbine hall and electrical generators.Look at a photo of ITER.(Photo By Oak Ridge National Laboratory - ITER Site, CC BY 2.0)ITER is smaller than a working commercial nuclear fusion power plant and does not have any turbines of generators. Can you see how a power plant based on this style of design, but larger and with much more equipment can be built for less cost that an existing nuclear fission power plant? I’m sceptical.And how much will the (relative) price of renewables have dropped between now and 2050? Solar panels and wind turbines have been getting cheaper, so have batteries.For these reasons, I suspect nuclear fusion power plants will be a dud. They will arrive too late and be too expensive.However, I’d love to be proved wrong.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,1.0,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Can-you-make-money-with-solar-power-and-cryptocurrency-mining

This competition produces most of the innovations we see around us. For instance, in the 1950s Americans were slacking in their space research. In came the Russians with their Sputnik. The national rivalries were sparked and in the following two decades world saw an amazing range of innovations in space science. Had the Russians never tried to compete with the Americans, we would not have had satellites or moon landing.Computers were mainly invented to break enemy codes in WWII and Internet was built during the cold war as a way to keep communication running in case the Russians managed to attack a few key points.If I'm able to type something that you could read somewhere else in the world, it is because of the national rivalries between US and other countries.It is all about incentives.Yesterday, I was listening to a lecture from a popular historian on why India, China and Arabs didn't discover the new trade routes at their heights in the middle ages. One of the key reasoning was the profit motive. These cultures didn't desire for much from the west. In fact, when Vasco da Gama visited Calicut for the first time, the locals laughed at what he had to offer. Thus, the Portuguese had to just give up their silver having no other useful stuff. This trade imbalance continued for centuries.On the other hand, Portuguese, Dutch and later other Europeans had plenty to gain - silk, spices and later coffee, tea, cotton etc. Thus, they had the motive. This resulted in their exploration around the world. If the Europeans were not in so much pain to compete, they would not have discovered the new world and other parts of the world.Money and pride are two of the biggest motivators for humans. This keeps our engine running.Monopolies and InnovationTwelve years ago, Microsoft had very little competition in the browser space. Internet Explorer was at some point clueless of what should be done. Innovation sagged in the absence of competition. Then Firefox came with a variety of new innovation such as a practical implementation of the tabbed interface. IE6 was then started to get dusted up. Later Chrome joined the party. Innovation in browsers rapidly expanded.Ultimately it was the competition. Same in the case of politics. When there is rivalry, nations innovate. Money and pride motivate the commoners to pay attention to their scientists and then fund them with resources to push the frontiers. Without that push from government, science will sag and so will every other part of the society.In short, competition in governance and politics is very crucial just as a riveting football game enriches our fun time. Of course, hooliganism is bad and so are wars. Thus, we have to constantly work towards ways to keep the rowdy crowd under control and root out violence. But, hooliganism doesn't mean you need to avoid playing. In the same way wars don't mean we have to stop national rivalries and pride.Who benefits from this one world?You can see this ""one world"" government idea from Indians and possibly from some Chinese and Americans. It is not a surprise. Because, groups with huge demographic advantage would dominate this ""one world"" while smaller cultures will be waylaid. Imagine Israel. Is there any possibility of them merging with this one world and give up all the things they fought for? One world will be the trampling of small cultural groups.What if Idi Amin is the world leader?Finally, when people think of ""one world"" they have some utopian visions. Doves flying, smiling child faces. What if the one world leader is Idi Amin? When he was ruling Uganda his people at least had the option of moving to other countries. What if there is no other country to go to? How will you escape tyranny?Do you think it is impossible to elect a tyrant as the world leader? Think again. There are far more crazy people in the world than scholars and peace activists. In ""one world"" these people would have enormous power from the scale. You can already see some semblance of this in the elections in big countries. The moderates get weeded out in large countries as they cannot match the organizational power of the strong. When you expand their reach to the whole world, the good politicians don't stand a chance.Leave alone tyranny. How about fundamental differences in culture? Islam will be the largest religion of this ""one world"".  It is possible for a democratically elected world government to propose Sharia law. Will it be acceptable to others?

Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantity or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel-No greenhouse gasses produced-No reactor core meltdowns and no fission product decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)-No mining of fuel is required for several forms of fusion as deuterium fuel is extracted directly from water. For first generation deuterium-tritium fusion; lithium must be mined and then exposed to a source of neutrons to form tritium fuel. Second generation fusion fuels like pure deuterium is totally nonradioactive and can be obtained from sea water without resorting to surface mining.-Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus a few thousand years for uranium based fission and a few hundreds of years for fossil fuels)-1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power (typical nuclear power). Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.-Radioactive waste remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands. DT fusion reactors would burn and require storage of significant quantities of tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not highly hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.-Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)-No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy

Grams, maybe. Pounds - no way! And the “fuel” is relatively harmless. Deuterium, Lithium, stuff like that. The Fusion reactor itself, on the other hand will be quite radioactive: The many tons of whatever its built from will have been intensely irradiated by the fusion going on, producing radioactive material, but I doubt that it can match the wide variety of nasty stuff from a fission reactor. So: I think a fission reactor would have far more potential for radioactive contamination than a fusion reactor, once we have one. But explosive danger? No.[ Thought added in edit: I do see one problem peculiar to the type of fusion reactors we’re working on now: the huge magnetic field they require. These magnetic field are critical to the fusion reactor operation, and the stronger the field, the smaller the reactor can be. These fields store a LOT of energy, and depend upon superconductors to keep the huge currents flowing. If part of the electric circuit drops out of superconductivity, the energy gets dumped into that failed part, and will create a huge electric arc, likely destroying the field coils, possibly destroying the whole system.

This is a fantastically high density, not easy to conceive of even.In such a case the reaction rate can indeed grow more quickly than the highly condensed and gravitationally bound matter can escape. This results in the helium flash in dwarf stars like the Sun, and it also is believed with quite good evidence to result in type Ia supernovae by another mechanism than the helium flash. The helium flash does not destroy a star like the Sun, but it does lift the whole core out of electron degeneracy against its own gravity. In a white dwarf that undergoes a type Ia supernova the star is completely disrupted. The energy release is very large in such a runaway reaction.But such conditions are not possible to replicate on Earth, and thankfully so.Instead all designs for fusion reactors operate in regimes of far smaller density than exists in the core of the Sun even, where a runaway reaction is prevented because of the hydrodynamic factors that I mentioned above. Generally they operate at far higher temperatures and lower densities than exist in the core of the Sun, whatever the means is that is employed to confine the fusing plasma fuel, and the extreme heat leads to instabilities that attempt very, very hard to reduce the density of the plasma, and so turn the fusion reaction off long before it has time to run away in the sense you may mean. This is true of all of the magnetic confinement designs. That is in fact the major difficulty, keeping the hot and fairly dilute plasma from simply expanding and hitting the walls of the reactor vessel.The exception, and the only known viable artificial exception to this on Earth is inertial confinement of a very high temperature plasma, maybe ten times the temperature at the core of the Sun -this plasma is created by using a large part of the energy of a small fission weapon to produce an extremely efficient compression and heating (there is more to it than this of course) of some macroscopic amount of fusion fuel, typically lithium deuteride is used. This of course is a thermonuclear weapon, and it is dependent on a runaway fusion reaction. The fusion still ends once the fuel has expanded enough and been exhausted, but the densities and temperatures reached are high enough and last long enough that there is a spectacular release of energy from the bomb fuel.Now there are versions of inertial confinement fusion reactor design, which use the same basic principle as a bomb to try to initiate a fusion reaction, but these limit the energy release by using very tiny pellets of fuel. So while the reaction would runaway, ideally, it would cut off due to the drop in density and exhaustion of fuel before a big enough energy release would occur to be dangerous.it’s similar to the use of controlled explosions in the pistons in internal combustion engines. You don’t set out to build a huge fuel air explosive based on gasoline, you set out to build a motor instead, so that is what you get. You don’t get a bomb.In practice inertial confinement fusion reactors have proved hard to actually make work, aside from fusion bombs, which you could I suppose loosely call fusion reactors.The other appraches to building fusion reactors are either working in regimes of density and temperature in which the fusion reaction will always be self-limiting, or else they are using very small amounts of fusion fuel and are pulsed.Such designs inherently avoid the possibility of a runaway reaction. It’s not quite the same way as thermal spectrum nuclear reactors do this, but it is analogous. The conditions needed for a working power reactor are very diffferent than those needed for a bomb.Now, if the approach is magnetic confinement, then in the very largest machines designed, the energy stored in the confining magnetic fields is huge, and it certainly could produce quite an explosion in principle, but it would be like a conventional explosion at worst, even if there were no mitigation at all designed into the reactor building.If the confining magnets were to explode, the confining field would be lost, and the fusion reactions in the plasma would quickly end. So there would never be a thermonuclear explosion.Now in the early days, people, namely Edward Teller, did worry that a nuclear or thermonuclear explosion might ignite the Earth’a atmosphere or the oceans in a runaway fusion reaction. So, before the Trinity test I believe, Hans Bethe actually did a calculation that showed, correctly, as it turned out, after many bomb tests in the atmosphere and oceans, that while the energy of the weapon can and does certainly produce some nuclear reactions in the atmosphere or oceans, which do release some energy, still, the power released by these reactions is much smaller than the power disssipated otherwise in the atmosphere or oceans, so that a self-sustaining reaction in the atmosphere simply cannot be started this way. It is not at all like setting fire to dry kindling.No possibility of such a fusion reaction initiated by a thermonuclear weapon exists.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy

This difference in plasma ion density between ICF and MCR fusion has real practical impacts on how much energy you can practically produce from a small fusion reactor. ICF fusion using ultra-dense fusion plasma has a clear natural advantage in small fusion reactors if the size of the fusion driver to initiate fusion is made manageable.The issue of producing net energy while simultaneously achieving a high enough power reactor power density are the dominant themes of the near future in selection of which fusion technology is best suited to produce competitive fusion power plants that communities will want to build to produce safe and dependable nuclear power.The ultimate prospects of He3 + He3 fusion in physically small Inertial Confinement Fusion Reactors are goodHe3 + He3 -> He4 + 2protons + 12.9 MeVuses totally non-radioactive fuel and produces totally non-radioative Helium as nuclear waste (and no neutrons - only easily shieldable protons that can be collected and directly produce electricity at very high efficiency exceeding the Carnot efficiency of any thermal power plant)The combined requirements of He3-He3 ICF fusion is only about 40X the combined temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time requirements of DT fusion. This not an impossibly high requirement and will be reached in future ICF fusion power plants.A graphic by Professor Gerald Kulcinski comparing key fusion reactions (including He3-He3)To be fair, it should also be remembered that the cost of ICF fusion systems tends to be dominated by the cost of the fusion driver. If the ICF fusion laser is the size of several football fields, many of the cost benefits of using an ultradense plasma are at least partially lost. NIF ICF laser fusion still requires a lot of cement and steel to build. ICF fusion power plants will become increasingly cost competitive as the cost and physical size of the fusion driver (laser, particle beam, etc.) is reduced and the sustained recent four decade record of improvement in the power of large fast pulse lasers for ICF fusion is extraordinary. In the last ten years the power of large fast pulse lasers has increased by a factor of 1000X (while the cost and physical size of powerful fast pulse lasers has significantly dropped).He3 based fusion has many significant advantages for small reactor applications directly powering cars, planes, trains, and perhaps rockets to go to the stars.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.Pure He3-He3 inertial confinement fusion power plants in mobile applications like vehicles or tools could use periodic bursts of fusion energy to produce electricity through magneto-hydrodynamic power conversion (no moving parts - near 100% Carnot cycle energy conversion efficiency) to recharge batteries which would propel an exploratory vehicle across the surface of a remote planet.(picture by Paul Dimar)(and the amount of He3 we could potentially manufacture on earth from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 burning side chain while it manufactures He3 is very vast - 2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinement (about half of the fusion experiments in history have run Deuterium fusion fuel for part or all of their operational lifetimes).It is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion side chain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Graph of fusion reaction rates versus temperature for several important fusion reactions.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVThe relative abundance of He3 in lunar regolith is actually quite low (much lower than the average abundance of Uranium or Thorium in the earth's crust).Because the Moon has been bombarded for billions of years by solar wind, which consists largely of ionized hydrogen and ionized helium, helium-3 is available in the dust of the lunar surface.

Hundreds of millions of tons of lunar soil (more properly called regolith) must be mined and processed to extract a ton of helium-3.The average abundance of Uranium in the earth's crust is 2 ppm and Thorium in the earth's crust is 6 ppm (about two orders of magnitude the average natural abundance of He3 in lunar regolith).",458 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-were-to-have-a-steady-supply-of-the-He-3-Helium-Isotope-how-small-could-we-make-their-fusion-reactor

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheed-has-solved-the-plasma-containment-problem-what-remaining-technical-hurdles-exist-before-a-power-reactor-could-be-built

So if the reactor produces 3 kW, the car would be limited to a 9mph top speed!However, if the car still had a decent battery pack, the nuclear reactor could recharge it overnight by about 90 miles in 10 hours - which is enough for most people’s commute.Failing that - fitting 10 bowling balls into the trunk of the car would get you a 90mph car without needing batteries…and the reactors would last longer than the car itself, so it would never need refueling or recharging.[[UPDATE]] :But it would take 7 tonnes of fuel rods (which are insanely radioactive) to get enough Americium for ONE of those reactors. The cost of one would run into the billions of dollars range.CONCLUSION:It’s completely implausible to do this in practice.",16 followers,Chris,794,1.2K,4.5M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheed-has-solved-the-plasma-containment-problem-what-remaining-technical-hurdles-exist-before-a-power-reactor-could-be-built

This not an impossibly high requirement and could be reached today in impure practical fission-fusion devices and will be reached in future in pure ICF fusion power plants.----------Manufacturing He3 using ICF D-D fusionD-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinement (about half of the fusion experiments in history have run Deuterium fusion fuel for part or all of their operational lifetimes).It is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV-----------ICF D-D fusion that generates net energy while suppressing the He3 burning fusion sidechain does not currently exist (although America’s first successful impure fission-fusion shot [Ivy-Mike 1952] generated large industrially significant amounts of fusion energy using D-D fusion).NIF is currently the largest non-military ICF fusion experiment in the world and it is not yet able to demonstrate much easier to achieve Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fusion.NIF currently produces substantially less than break even evergy when using easier DT fusionThe best NIF shots to date employing easier DT fusion produce less energy than it takes to operate the NIF lasers and flashlamps. Each shot requires LLL to draw about 422 MJ of energy from the power mains to charge the capacitor banks that store the energy to power the flashlamps that pump the NIF laser.NIF currently generates -0.050 MJ / 422 MJ x 100% = 0.0118% of the energy from fusion needed to reach engineering break-even energy.A significantly larger and more powerful laser or particle accelerator fusion driver would be required to drive an ICF D-D fusion experiment that produced net energy (probably a fusion driver capable of delivering about 100 MJ of energy in the time span of a couple of nanoseconds).--------The relative abundance of He3 in lunar regolith is actually quite low (much lower than the average abundance of gold or Uranium or Thorium fission fuel in the earth's crust).Note: X-axis is in units of parts per billionBecause the Moon has been bombarded for billions of years by solar wind, which consists largely of ionized hydrogen and ionized helium, helium-3 is available in the dust of the lunar surface. Even there, however, helium-3 is present only in average concentrations between 10 and 20 parts per billion. Hundreds of millions of tons of lunar soil (more properly called regolith) must be mined and processed to extract a ton of helium-3.The average abundance of Uranium in the earth's crust is 2 ppm and Thorium in the earth's crust is 6 ppm (about two orders of magnitude the average natural abundance of He3 in lunar regolith).With an appropriate laser fast pulse fusion driver, you can build extraordinarily small fusion devices (the NIF fusion capsule is a 2mm diameter hollow sphere filled with 190 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fusion fuel) and with He3-He3 the protons produced from the reaction can be easily shielded and used in very light weight ""venetian blind"" direct energy converters to convert the energy in protons directly into electricity to drive electric motor powered transports.The combined requirements of He3-He3 ICF fusion is only about 40X the combined temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time requirements of DT fusion. This not an impossibly high requirement and will be reached in future ICF fusion power plants.Fission powered cars and planes will probably never be - the shielding requirements are just too large and this makes fission mobile applications impractical.Aneutronic fusion powered cars, planes, trains, ships, and even compact power tools will in a near future decade be practical.If D-D fusion reactors can be operated in a way that suppresses the fusion side chain that burns He3. It will be possible to use ICF D-D fusion reactors that are tuned specifically for the combined goals of1) fusion power generation2) He3 fuel productionto produce large amounts of Deuterium in seawater to He3 without having to go to the moon to mine lunar He3._________In normal D-D fusion, the He3 produced is just burned off immediately in the sidechain reactionHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVbut this side-chain actually reaches fusion condition and proceeds with reasonable reaction rate only at higher temperatures.It should be possible to operate a future inertial confinement D-D fusion reactor in a ""pulse mode"" that permits scavenging He3 out of the remaining fusion plasma remaining in the fusion chamber after each ICF fusion shot. By this means, the net manufacture of He3 on earth should be possible. This will be a more economical and practical way to obtain He3 on earth than going to the moon for it.The ultimate fusion fuel feedstock to produce He3 is Deuterium separated from seawater, which is totally non-radioactive. He3 produced from ICF D-D fusion reactors is also totally non-radioactive. The results of He3-He3 fusion is Helium-4 and protons, which is totally non-radioactive.He3-He3 produces no neutrons at all - so neutron activation of fusion reactor structure and materials is not a problem (totally non-radioactive). Under sound government leadership and appropriate nuclear regulation, Aneutronic He3-He3 fusion will be an approach to fusion that will be particularly suitable to power transportation needs and it could be widely deployed worldwide to lift the human condition.In aneutronic ICF He3-He3 fusion - small can be beautiful (and practical)(slide comparing fusion reactions by Professor Gerald Kulcinski)","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.4M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-were-to-have-a-steady-supply-of-the-He-3-Helium-Isotope-how-small-could-we-make-their-fusion-reactor
9,"As others point out here, there is no prospect of needing He-3 for fusion reactors any time in this century.It is harder to fuse than tritium and while it reduces some of the costs of operating a fusion reactor (no tritium breeding blanket needed, neutron damage and activation greatly reduced) it will make the most expensive part of a fusion reactor — the magnetic confinement system — much more expensive.

This isn’t a win.Not even tritium fusion reactors will be profitable to operate this century, projected costs are 5 to 10 times too high.If He-3 is ever valuable for producing energy it is most likely to be for extremely high performance space propulsion systems in the fairly remote future.That all said, how feasible is mining He-3 on the Moon anyway?I find it a very useful way to evaluate space mining proposals to compare them with the costs and value of mining here on Earth.How valuable does ore have to be to make it worthwhile mining on Earth?Lets look at the value of some low grade ores here on Earth that are profitably mined.These low grade mines are all surface mined as underground mining is much more expensive.Copper: 0.6%, $38/tonne (metal content).Gold: 1 g/tonne, $40/tonne (metal content).Iron ore: $70/ton. This is the actual sale price of the ore, not the metal content, and it must be high grade always, >50% Fe.Coal: $12/tonne (Powder River Basin, WY). This is perhaps the cheapest mining operation in the world, with very easily accessible coal produced in very large quantities from shallow surface mined deposits.There are ores that are more valuable. Underground mining costs (hard rock) are hundreds of dollars a ton, and so is the value of the ores extracted.What is the value of lunar regolith “ore”?The highest actually measured values for He-3 on the Moon is 15 ppb (parts per billion).The value of He-3 is somewhat speculative. In some sense He-3 should cost the same as tritium, since tritium turns into He-3 at the rate of 5.5%/year. Tritium can be manufactured and sold right now for $30,000/g. The actual selling price for He-3 is lower than this, ranging from $700/g to $15,000/g in recent years, but the higher tritium based price is more representative of its hypothetical use as a fuel.This gives us an ore value of $450/tonne (15 ppb).Is is at all plausible that miningThere is speculation, well founded perhaps, but speculative anyway, that concentrations several times higher that 15 ppb may exist in high grade deposits. 50 ppb is often quoted and even an upper end estimate of 150 ppb has been offered.This would place the ore value in the range of $1500-$4500/tonne, in the same range as the most valuable ores on Earth currently mined - the CAMECO uranium mines in Canada, and the Klondex gold mine in Nevada.On Earth mining such an ore would be an easy sell, if there was a market large enough to recoup investment costs.But put the ore on the Moon, where it must be mined in a vacuum, by unmanned equipment sent from Earth, able to operate for years without servicing, and you find few (well, no) serious mining investors.And the reality is that there is no prospective market for helium-3 beyond the current one that amounts to only several million dollars a year.When we have the ability to build deep space propulsion systems that rely on He-3 fuel then mining the He-3 might not be a big deal then. But we are talking centuries from now with technologies that are entirely imaginary (though not impossible, as far as we know).But when we have such an extravagant technology base and demand, mining helium-3 on the Moon may still not be the method of choice.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy.

You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-General-Fusions-approach-to-a-viable-fusion-reactor

Suffice it to say, with reasonable engineering choices, a fusion-electric hybrid car should be able to circle the globe several times on 2 grams of heavy water (or 0.4 grams of Deuterium).While there are undeniable problems (mostly shielding related) to fission and fusion powered mobile vehicles including cars and airplanes on earth, the situation could be different for vehicles used to explore the surface of planets in space. As mankind explores the outer solar system (Mars) there is a chance that nuclear powered vehicles could emerge.Fusion has many significant advantages for directly powering cars, planes, trains, and rockets to go to the stars.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in the universe. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant element in the universe, fully 10^10 times more abundant than any combination of fission fuels.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Fast Neutrons from fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. than penetrating gamma rays from fission A combination of High-Z material like Bismuth loaded as a powder into light weight and economical Borated HDPE poly plastic is effective in stopping neutrons and is lighter than the lead required for gamma shielding of fission reactors. HDPE can be easily cast into whatever form desired forming shielding with no gaps providing excellent operator safety.5) At some time in the future it should be possible to use aneutronic fusion fuels like He3-He3 that produce no neutrons and release fusion energy into a combination of charged particles (protons) and heat. While He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth, it can be produced in large quantities relatively inexpensively in stationary D-D fusion commercial power reactors.While pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has since 1952) producing fusion power on demand [3].Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutron less He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Modern small pure He3-He3 inertial confinement fusion power plants in mobile applications like vehicles or tools could use periodic bursts of fusion energy to produce electricity through magneto-hydrodynamic power conversion (no moving parts - near 100% Carnot cycle energy conversion efficiency) to recharge batteries which propel the vehicle across the surface of a remote planet [2].Will there ever be a nuclear powered car?Perhaps not in the near term, but multi-axle all wheel drive exploratory vehicles helping transport astronauts on Mars powered by some form of nuclear fusion including pure aneutronic He3-He3 ICF fusion could be another matter.[1] - Y.

Fusion of Deuterium in sea water uses a totally non-radioactive fuel and produces only totally non-radioactive waste (Helium). The environmental consequences of operating 10,000 to 30,000 new fusion reactors is easier to manage than the environmental consequences of operating an equivalent number of new fission reactors.Richard E. Smalley, “Future Global Energy Prosperity: The Terawatt Challenge”The thing that is most responsible for holding back fusion innovation and the practical construction of fusion power plants is not really engineering issues (of which there are still some formidable ones remaining) but rather is a widely shared public belief thatFUSION IS IMPOSSIBLE(but)Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which is designed to produce a small, safe, predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ per shot.Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of Deuterium produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium).--------Clean Sustainable Power Longer than the Earth has Existed or the Sun will BurnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium.The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons.Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy.In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn)Here are a few reasons why fusion should ultimately be- Only tiny amounts of fusion fuel are inside a fusion reactor at any one time. Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantity or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel-No greenhouse gasses produced-No reactor core meltdowns and no fission product decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)-No mining of fuel is required for several forms of fusion as deuterium fuel is extracted from water. For first generation deuterium-tritium fusion; lithium must be mined and then exposed to a source of neutrons to form tritium fuel.-Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus a few thousand years for uranium based fission and a few hundreds of years for fossil fuels)-1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power (typical nuclear power). Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.-Radioactive waste remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands. DT fusion reactors would burn and require storage of significant quantities of tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not highly hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.-Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)-No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,17.0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-nuclear-energy-be-clean-when-it-comes-with-waste-that-is-radioactive-for-centuries

It makes some sense to minimize the size and cost of an ICF fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) by using some DT fuel as the first stage fusion primary (the match) while producing the majority of fusion power from ubiquitous sustainable D-D fusion of pure Deuterium.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Conceptual Drawing of a 2-stage DT-DD clean energy optimized pure fusion device.How efficient would a mini-PACER power plant be?Inertial Confinement fusion experiments produce their energy is a repeated succession of short energetic fusion bursts. A two stage DT-DD device has a significant advantage over a single stage ICF fusion target in energy gain.At a power plant level, the fairest and best way to express the efficiency of a fusion power plant is in terms of “wall plug efficiency”. How much (electrical) power do you have to draw from the local power mains to produce a given amount of fusion generated electricity?Modern semi-conductor lasers are between 10% to 30% efficient at converting local electrical power into ultra-violet or X-ray laser light (lets say 10% efficient for the purpose of this calculation). To deliver 20 MJ of light energy to the DT primary fusion capsule would require drawing about 200 MJ of electrical energy from the local power grid. Realistically, there are some additional inefficiencies in delivering ultra-violet or X-ray laser light to the fusion capsule -So the best estimate for the amount of electrical energy that has to be drawn from the local power grid to deliver 20 MJ of ultra-violet or X-ray energy to the fusion capsule is 1000 MJ per shot.An energy yield of 250 GJ is equivalent to an energy yield of 250 x 10^3 MJHow would a Hybrid DT-DD Pure Fusion mini-PACER Power Plant Work?Here is a quick synopsis of how a pure 2-stage DT-DD mini-PACER fusion power plant would work.The mini-PACER cavity, which is 11 meters in diameter and 51 meters in length and of cylindrical shape vertically oriented is buried at 100 meters depth in the ground. The mini-PACER cavity is first pumped down to a soft vacuum; this reduces that pressure peak experienced inside the cavity while firing the pure fusion PPFD (peaceful pure fusion device).Concept Picture of a mini-PACER power plant -It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~30 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,18.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-General-Fusions-approach-to-a-viable-fusion-reactor

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777.1K,19.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-General-Fusions-approach-to-a-viable-fusion-reactor

Exceed break even point on Energy: In other words make more energy than the energy you use to start the reaction. Power reactors are meant to make energy not use them. So you need to exceed that point and that has been the difficult task with all magnetic confinement fusion schemes. The Tokamak research, for instance, started very promising but it proved very challenging to get the density and temperature combination that exceeds the breakeven point. The magnetic confinement method is just getting to that point this decade.

The energy density in the core of the sun is only about that of a good compost heap:So this is the challenge - reproduce the conditions of an H-bomb but do it continuously. In an H bomb we generate the conditions by setting off a fission bomb.In a reactor, we want to contain the energy generated by fusion such that the hydrogen stays hot enough to fuse. It is not enough to have fusion, the fusion itself must create the heat needed to keep the hydrogen hot enough to fuse - the reaction must be self sustaining. This is different than a H-bomb where happens so incredibly quickly that by the time that the hydrogen escapes, enough of it has already reacted.The leading candidates for confinement are inertial confinement and magnetic confinement.Inertial confinement is basically the H-bomb system but with the heating and compression of the fission bomb being replaced by lasers. We make pellets of deuterium and tritium. We feed them to a reaction chamber. We put very precise optics around the chamber somehow such that intense laser light compresses and ignites the pellet causing a miniature H bomb explosion. Most of the energy comes out in the form of 14.7 MeV neutrons which trash the apparatus over time but also are used to breed more tritium. Ultimately there are two big thresholds which are overall system energy breakeven - you have to generate enough heat to convert to electricity (something like 2/3rd’s of which is lost due to thermodynamic laws) to power the lasers.The second big threshold is that you have to make this into a power plant. Power plant concepts that we use now are very simple - boil water in a pot - and end up still producing a significant bill at the end of the month! Laser based inertial confinement seems extremely complicated and inherently expensive by comparison. Ultimately it is always about money (unless it is about physics). It is one thing to spend money on research and another to have to build and maintain plants each of which is ten times (or a hundred times???) more expensive than what we have now producing power.Magnetic confinement is more about physics, perhaps. Well, the current experimental tokamak facility being built, ITER, looks like it may reach 20 billion before completion, so maybe it is more about money! Note that this is not 20 billion for a power plant, this is just the proof of principle experiment - the proof that the physics can be licked. The argument is that if we make the experiment big enough, that that will be enough to fix the physics (plus it will take a lot of researchers through to their retirement age as we have been working on magnetic confinement for 50 years now).At any rate, the physics issues are perhaps radiation loss and instabilities. Confining the plasma, the very hot, ionized, hydrogen gas has been likened to confining jello with rubber bands - it always wants to squeeze out, it always wants to find a hole, or to make a hole.Radiation losses are that the magnetic confinement works because charged particles circle magnetic field lines. Circling particles are accelerating. Accelerating charges radiate energy. This energy is lost from the plasma cooling it (and the plasma is tenuous enough that making the reactor bigger doesn’t help this problem). The plasma is really hot, perhaps 800 million degrees centigrade such that the particles are moving really fast, such that they accelerate a lot, such that they radiate a lot. For DT fusion, most of the energy is in the neutron that is created which is all lost from the plasma. For other types of fusion, less (or no) energy is in produced neutrons, but these must be much hotter such that the radiation losses are greater. Beyond the first few easiest fusion reactions, the radiation losses are obviously prohibitive.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of cold war underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule.These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1977 - 1987) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked and reliably and repeatedly produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.What is lacking in current ICF fusion experiments to support building of practical ICF fusion power plants is a fusion driver with characteristics close enough to the driver employed by LANL and LLNL in Halite-Centurion tests to permit full fusion ignition with energy gain. A driver capable of delivering greater than 20 MJ into a focused area less than a 2 mm in time of less than 3 nanoseconds. The current NIF driver laser driver is capable of delivering about 2 MJ total energy and is only able to achieve ""alpha heating"" phase of fusion operation - a stage that immediately precedes fusion ignition. LASNEX and HYDRA computer simulations of the mid-1990s on which LLNL based the engineering design of the NIF laser were overly optimistic in predicting the required fusion driver characteristics to produce ignition. Failure of the LASNEX and HYDRA simulations resulted in NIF being built too small to achieve the goal of fusion ignition and for NIF to serve as the basis of LIFE ICF fusion power plant technology. It must also however be admitted that besides driver power, there are other slightly less critical (but still important) unsolved engineering issues for ICF including implosion symmetry and plasma instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor) that rob energy from ICF plasma when it nears fusion conditions. Use of a more robust fusion driver such as was employed in cold war Halite-Centurion X-ray initiated DT fusion experiments permitted slightly less than optimum symmetry and mild plasma instabilities and still work and produce DT fusion with energy gain.The Sustained Four Decade Progress in High Power Pulsed Lasers has been phenomenal and continues to be phenomenal.Progress in the laser fusion driver area holding back ICF fusion is proceeding rapidly and relentlessly, with a four decade demonstrated rate of advance that exceeds any other sustained technology effort (including Moore’s law - the growth in the number of transistors on CPU chips). In the past ten years, the power of large fast pulse lasers of type appropriate as a laser fusion driver has improved by a factor of 1000X.Fast Pulse lasers are rapidly getting improving relative to other possible ICF fusion drivers. While lasers are getting more powerful - they are also getting cheaper to build and operate.The following link is to a table showing the historical progress of fast pulse lasers as are appropriate for use as ICF fusion drivers -High Power Pulsed LasersIt must however be admitted that in an environment of considerable progress, existing laser drivers are still too small to reliably produce ICF DT fusion ignition. Successful ignition requires high delivered power combined with sufficient total energy delivered to the fusion capsule.Based on results of actual cold war Halite-Centurion ignition experimentsfull DT ignition of small sub-gram DT spheres requires -20 MJ of x-ray laser energy delivered to a spot 2 mm in diameter in a time frame of ~3 nanoseconds or less.NIF is currently only capable of producing about 2 MJ of energy but is capable of producing 500 TW short bright powerful light pulses on the order of about 100 femtoseconds in width to the fusion target. Losses inside the hohlraum reduce delivered X-ray energy to the actual fusion capsule to around 26 kilojoules of energy.NIF is currently not capable of producing full fusion ignition but succeeds in operating in a ""alpha-heating"" regime that occurs just prior to ignition.Good work in the direction of pure ICF fusion devices already exists -In the cold war era, LANL and LLNL did preliminary pure fusion device designs but were not successful with available 1970s fusion driver technology. In the year 2001 DOE permitted disclosure of the fact that the US had a well organized and well funded sustained effort to produce ultra-clean pure fusion devices that did not require nuclear fission to produce the conditions for ICF fuson.RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html(see section C of this document)Good Preliminary designs for ICF fusion power plants now exist -Dr. Ralph Moir has designed several Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants.

In truth, however, we really have no idea. The long running joke is that fusion power, with unlimited and cheap energy for all of mankind, has been just ""20 years away"" for the past three quarters of a century. Fusion power is the ultimate lottery: but we do not know if the winning numbers actually exist.As for what it will mean for mankind, your guess is a bad as mine. We simply do not know if it will ever be economically feasible to power our energy needs with fusion. Indeed, it may come to pass that fusion, because of its costs, becomes merely a niche power source. Or it may usher in the dawn of a second energy revolution with ramifications as great as the first (the harnessing of fossil fuels in the 19th and 20th centuries). We simply do not know.On a pessimistic note, it is possible that fusion power will eventually share the fate of fission power: a potentially near-perfect energy source doomed to play a minor role in mankind's history, not because of physical limitations, because of mankind's foibles.",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777.1K,4.0,https://www.quora.com/How-far-are-we-from-building-our-first-fusion-reactor

The problem is that one deuterium - tritium reaction produces one neutron, and one neutron - lithium reaction produces one nucleus of tritium, which in turn will allow one new deuterium - tritium reaction. This, if only one neutron is lost during the whole process (e.g. if it gets absorbed by the tokamak walls, the surrounding environment etc.) then tritium is found to be missing, sooner or later. Since neutron losses are unavoidable, this means that continuous operation of deuterium - tritium tokamak reactors ultimately relies on some external source of tritium in order to compensate for losses, e.g. on an external nuclear fission reactor (in case of missing volcanoes).",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions.

UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,14.0,https://www.quora.com/How-far-are-we-from-building-our-first-fusion-reactor

Fusion reactors tend to be more complex than current fission reactors or fossil fuel power plants. Greater fusion power plant complexity could initially in the first couple of decades of operation tend to translate into unpredictable breakdowns and unplanned outages in power generation. Breakdowns in power generation can damage sensitive electronics and injure delicate loads on the grid that require smooth predictable electrical power without dropouts or transients and in some cases, this can produce a safety problem.- Many fusion experiments utilize very high voltages while producing fusion conditions in plasma. Fusion nuclear workers can be subject to potentially fatal non-nuclear electrical shock while installing and maintaining high voltage systems.Robert Steinhaus's answer to What are some of the negatives of nuclear fusion?It is possible that neutrons produced by commercial fusion reactors could be used to breed fissile fuels for conventional atomic weaponsThere is a small risk that early fusion reactors could be used to manufacture weapons materials for conventional fission and fission-fusion bombs.Fusion reactors operating using DT or DD fusion reactions are abundant sources of cheap neutrons. If fertile nuclear fuels like Thorium or U238 are placed in a breeding blanket surrounding the fusion chamber, weapons materials like U233 or Pu239 can be produced using abundant fusion neutrons. It should be possible to provide safeguards to prevent this, but periodic inspection of fusion reactors by IAEA nuclear inspectors may be necessary to ensure DT and DD fusion reactors are not used to breed fissile materials used to make conventional atomic bombs.Safeguard Requirements for Fusion Power PlantsPure fusion weaponsGiven the ingenuity of man, there is unfortunately some chance that pure fusion technology with entirely peaceful intensions could at some point be applied first to peaceful industrial explosives for excavation and mining and then at some point be redirected toward some form of pure fusion weapon. It is possible to kill with the energy releassed in burning a gallon of automotive gasoline. Practical fusion systems that release commercial energy are likely to have some hazards associated with them. Engineered safety systems will probably be needed to ensure the safety of fusion power plants and ensure the public is fully protected from all hazards.It should be noted that the development of pure fusion weapons is not an entirely negative prospect.Pure fusion weapons would retain many of the advantages of fusion (the majority of fusion fuels arecompletely nonradioactive and the nuclear waste pure fusion produces is only nonradioactive Hellium and free neutrons with an averagee lifetime of only about 15 minutes before they decay into harmless subatomic particles).Pure fusion weapons would in fact be a significant moral advance if people in the future continue to rely on explosive weapons to deter war.A pure fusion weapon can be designed to produce minimal (perhaps no) fallout or fission products at all. It is fallout that presents a long term hazard to life following use of conventional nuclear fission or fission-fusion weapons. Most of the fallout actually results from the fission side of current bombs. A pure fusion weapon could produce a significant (large) release of energy but the long term environmental impacts of use of pure fusion weapons can be designed to be very short term in effect (days with protective equipment and a few weeks without protective equipment). In contrast fission and fission-fusion weapons designs can spread fallout widely and that fallout can be hazardous to humans for hundreds to thousands of years.If mankind insists on retaining nuclear weapons, is would probably be in the interests of everyone on the planet and for all future generation to insist that all weapons retained for national defense be pure fusion weapons producing minimal fallout and minimal long term environmental impact.Note1:DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment.

But rocks can be had from the nearest quarries and people know how to make all kinds of weapons far more easily.Here’s a photo of the very first thermonuclear fusion bomb ever to be tested, in the Ivy Mike shot. It used liquid deuterium fuel. This is a close up shot of the device. You can see that it is contained in a large building. You can see the scale by looking at the man sitting there, and the other man standing at a work table on the far right of the frame.The horizontal tubes heading to the right are instrumentation devices. The giant vertical can contains the bomb. This device yielded 10.5 megaton TNT. Here’s a picture of the mushroom cloud from the explosion, taken from an observation aircraft from many, many miles away.You can see that it was a very successful explosion.But this was by no means a deliverable weapon. Your enemies are simply not going to let you spend months to a year, building, in one of their cities, a very large structure with associated control circuitry, and then allow you to fill it up with liquid deuterium, and then just detonate it. They are going to, inevitably, ask some pointed questions of you first …So a lot of research was left for the US bomb developers to turn this into a weapon. This was done and the designs were tested in the Castle series of nuclear weapons tests, one of which, Castle Bravo, turned out - completely unexpectedly - to be the largest yield test ever done in the US weapons testing program. Here’s a picture of that device, which was called SHRIMP. Instead of liquid deuterium, it used solid lithium deuteride as the source of fusion fuel and had a considerably more compact design using lighter metals and better explosives.It was much smaller and lighter than the device in Ivy Mike but still, at 10.5 tonnes, and 4.5 m long by 1 m in diameter, it was considered too heavy and too large to be practically deliverable by bomber. The Air Force insisted on smaller designs, and eventually these were made. For ICBMs, when they were finally built, still smaller and lighter warheads were required.The first H-bomb that was, practically, deliverable by air, may have been the RDS-37, designed mostly by Andrei Sakharov, and reportedly yielding about 3 MT. It was dropped from a Tupolev bomber in November 1955 in the initial test at Semipalatinsk. By all reports it operated on similar principles to the Teller-Ulam design that was tested in the Ivy Mike shot and it was also a lithium deuteride based weapon like the Castle Bravo device.Now, here is a mockup cutaway drawing of the ITER tokamak, the device that will, hopefully, sustain aIt has very strong magnets that confine and heat a rather dilute tritium/deuterium plasma. The key purpose of the design here is to confine that plasma for as long as possible and to heat the plasma as much as possible, so that the fusion rate, and so the generated power, will be high enough to balance or exceed the power that has to be put in to achieve the heating and confinement.But such a reactor is simply not designed to explode, and it cannot explode in a thermonuclear explosion.There is a lot of energy stored in the magnetic field of such a fusion reactor, and if the superconductors making that field were suddenly quenched, it could likely create a big mechanical explosion, destroying maybe even the whole complex as a result. So this is certainly an engineering contingency that has to be planned for by the designers. But the hot dilute plasma would instantly leak away in that case. There would be no uncontrolled runaway fusion explosion. There could not be.So there is no practical sense in which such a test fusion reactor can ever be made into a weapon, none that I can see.It is already well-known to people who are expert on it, how to make thermonuclear weapons, fusion based weapons. A fusion reactor is a completely different kind of animal.Oh, and as for using fast neutrons from deuterium/tritium fusion reactions to produce plutonium from natural uranium, or uranium-233 from thorium-232, that is theoretically possible, but it still doesn’t make even a working fusion reactor into a weapon. Anyways breeding fissile isotopes for use in fission bombs is by now very easily done using conventional, quite standard nuclear fission reactors, followed by chemical processing. This is also very far from being easy to do, due to the radiation dangers, but it can certainly be accomplished given a sufficiently talented and well-trained team, and the right equipment. It would be far easier to get neutrons for this purpose from other, much easier and cheaper to build sources, but still very intense sources, than to get neutrons from a prototype fusion reactor.If you want to design a weapon, then you set out to design a weapon, not a fusion reactor.And the quickest way to do that design is to buy or obtain help from a government that has done it already, and which for its own reasons, is willing to offer help.It turns out that designing fusion reactors is actually far more difficult than designing fusion weapons.",458 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,17.0,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,823,47.3K,779.4M,18.0,https://www.quora.com/How-far-are-we-from-building-our-first-fusion-reactor

UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,4.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-nuclear-fusion-reactors-not-made

This is because D-D fusion reaction rates in MCF fusion devices we know how to build are too low to result in break-even energy with D-D fusion. The situation is different however with Inertial Confinement Fusion. Commercially significant D-D fusion in Inertial Confinement Fusion reactors using pure deuterium fuel separated from sea water is practical but energy conversion in this case is unfortunately somewhat complex, with about 66% of the energy release from D-D fusion being released as energetic neutrons.D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWhile 66% of the energy of D-D fusion is released in fusion neutrons, a significant amount of energy is also released in charged protons and alpha particles.Unlike the charged particles, the uncharged neutrons cannot be confined by a magnetic field, and for this reason cannot be easily used for a direct conversion into electric energy.Some first generation fusion power plant concepts have featured early power conversion designs that primarily use fusion heat to produce electricity and use the larger 80% fraction of fusion energy found in energetic neutrons to breed Tritium in a breeding blanket loaded with Lithium-6.It is possible to propose energy conversion systems for D-D fusion power plants that attempt to capture some of the energy released by D-D fusion fast neutrons and turn that energy into heat. For such a system, the neutrons have to be slowed down in some medium (like molten lithium), heating this medium to a temperature of less than 10^3K. The heat collected in the lithium blanket is then removed from this medium and is used to drive a turbine-generator. This conversion of nuclear into electric energy unfortunately has a Carnot efficiency of about 30%.Using a lithium blanket to capture a portion of the energy in fusion neutrons, which is 80% of the energy released from DT fusion and 66% of the energy released from D-D fusion , the energy conversion efficiency is low - no more than 24% over all. Further, liquid lithium metal is very flammable at temperature likely to exist in operating first generation fusion reactors. Use of hot molten lithium metal as a neutron absorber - coolant could compromise the intrinsic safety of first generation fusion reactors. We should be trying to engineer the safest commercial fusion reactors we know how to design. I believe it would be better to consider using a safer coolant such as molten salts in first generation fusion reactors. Molten salts cannot spontaneously burst into flame when coming into contact with air or water in a large accident while compromising overall fusion reactor safety.While this relatively low 24% conversion efficiency of fusion energy into electrical energy cannot be overcome in magnetic confinement reactors we currently know how to build,ICF fusion power plants (both DT and DD) can be accomplished higher energy conversion efficiency by surrounding the inertial confinement fusion target with a sufficiently thick layer of liquid hydrogen and a thin outer layer of boron, creating a hot plasma fire ball. The hydrogen layer must be chosen just thick and dense enough to be heated by the neutrons to 100,000 degrees K. The so generated, fully ionized, and rapidly expanding hydrogen fire ball can then drive a pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator at an almost 100% Carnot efficiency [1].Magnetohydrodynamic Conversion of Fusion Energy into Electrical Energy -Electrostatic direct conversion -More advanced fusion reactions like p-B11 and He3-He3 that released a larger proportion of fusion energy as charged particles (protons and alpha particles) can use direct collection of charged particles working against magnetic or electrostatic field or directly collect particles on stationary screens to convert fusion energy charged particles into electrical energy at high efficiency[2].Electrostatic direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage. This voltage drives electricity in a wire. This becomes the electrical power. It is normally thought of in reverse. Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion. Direct conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It has been described as a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He proposed a way to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage, which would drive current in a wire. Dr. Post helped developed the theoretical underpinnings of direct conversion, which was later demonstrated by Dr. William Barr and Dr.Ralph Moir at LLNL. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981. In subsequent decades, the efficiency of converting the energy in charged particles as are produced in advanced fusion reactions into electricity was demonstrated at efficiencies as high as 80%, which is about twice as high an efficiency as the best current thermal power plant turbine generators can demonstrate while converting heat into electricity.[1] -","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-nuclear-fusion-reactors-not-made

These magnetic field are critical to the fusion reactor operation, and the stronger the field, the smaller the reactor can be. These fields store a LOT of energy, and depend upon superconductors to keep the huge currents flowing. If part of the electric circuit drops out of superconductivity, the energy gets dumped into that failed part, and will create a huge electric arc, likely destroying the field coils, possibly destroying the whole system.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power

The currently practical fusion technology is called fission-fusion, where nuclear fission is used to reliably produce the conditions for fusion.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are designs for smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium).Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over gas and diesel cars -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen and an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium are the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, and Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for fusion car applications and deserve close attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be fusion cars?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary. ICF fusion power plants will probably be smaller than MCF fusion and may ultimately be of a size that could be installed in certain transportation vehicles (ships, trains, planes, trucks, and ultimately cars). What will probably be the most practical way to fusion powered vehicles (of a sort) for perhaps the next fifty years is to use stationary fusion power plants to produce electricity and then to use nuclear fusion produced electricity to charge conventional electric vehicles with storage batteries.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion ----------","5,352 followers",Valerio Cietto,1.1K,2.4K,9.1M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power

You can then take that plasma in a very carefully shaped Electromagnetic field and spit the plasma out the back of your spacecraft.In both of these cases the reaction creates a very hot gas that wants to expand and then you only let it expand in one direction, just like a normal combustion rocket.Only the energy you get out of a chemical rocket is quite cold in comparison to the energy of a nuclear reaction. In fact there is so much energy involved that we basically have no material (not even your diamond chamber) that can reliably contain that energy.Or you could do something stupid and wasteful like explode a nuclear bomb behind your spacecraft and ride the expanding cloud of plasma as it pushes you forward. But, that would be horrendously inefficient as you would lose the majority of your energy out in all directions while you only captured the tiny amount that happened to hit your ship.

As a qualitative comparison, traditional chemical rockets—such as the Saturn V that took the Apollo program to the Moon—produce high thrust with low specific impulse, whereas electric ion engines produce a small amount of thrust very efficiently. Orion would have offered performance greater than the most advanced conventional or nuclear rocket engines then under consideration. Supporters of Project Orion felt that it had potential for cheap interplanetary travel, but it lost political approval over concerns with fallout from its propulsion.[2]The Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 is generally acknowledged to have ended the project. However, from Project Longshot to Project Daedalus, Mini-Mag Orion, and other proposals which reach engineering analysis at the level of considering thermal power dissipation, the principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight. Such later proposals have tended to modify the basic principle by envisioning equipment driving detonation of much smaller fission or fusion pellets, although in contrast Project Orion's larger nuclear pulse units (nuclear bombs) were based on less speculative technology.Details of the pusher plate & shock absorber system.A pulse unit (bomb) is shot through the centerline tube and goes off a preset distance from the plate.Details of the specialized nuclear explosives used. The bomb was designed to create and push a dense plasma cloud against the pusher plate. This served two purposes.Diamond is not a practical material for this application.

As such, even it works, it won’t come cheap and may not be a universal solution.Another thing to consider which is nearly as important, energy production is only part of the issue, The advantage of gasoline is the simple fact that it is easy to store, easy to transport, easy to refill, and creates a good weight energy ratio. As such, we will need to have not only energy production but also better storage and transportation. As an example, batteries today are expensive to produce, consume a lot of rare elements, and don't last long. This is not a long term solution either,What is obvious to me is the simple fact that Fusion energy may come in as an expensive way to produce energy. It is very possible that less elaborate means like dams or solar power may be less expensive in the long run. If it is so, fusion may become the last option for power-hungry nations with high technical capabilities but not an option for the countries which cannot afford it.If we are able to produce sustainable cheap fusion energy, it won't be a revolution because we already have cheap energy. What we are speaking is about changing from one way to produce electricity in another way mostly because of oil rarefaction. This shouldn’t change our way of life but make it sustainable long term. Hardly a revolution but rather a slow transformation. Let’s remind everybody we still huge oil and oil equivalents reserves.

Reliable and clean energy makes virtually all other major problems confronting mankind including -2. Water3. Food4. Environment5. Poverty6. Terrorism and war7 Disease8. Education9. DemocracyI0. Populationeasier to solve.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that used impure fission-fusion to produce fusion energy. Ivy-Mike was mankind’s first successful approach to reliably producing fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion while using a small nuclear fission device to bring Deuterium fusion plasma to fusion conditions (temperature, confinement time, and plasma density). Today, there are much smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ of energy per shot.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy as would be released when efficiently burning about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to a spot of less than a 2 mm diameter) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Mini-Mike pure fusion deviceA laser or ion-beam fusion driver irradiates a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere from the left, which initiates D-T fusion which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a pressurized liquid deuterium filled tube.Cold War era Halite-Centurion field test experiments[1] showed that an intense beam of X-rays is sufficient to produce full fusion ignition of small amounts (grams) of Deuterium-Tritium fuel held in small hollow spheres mounted at a remote distance from the X-ray source.Successful ICF DT fusion ignition is not a matter of conjecture or technical speculation but is rather an observed fact. With the 1952 Ivy-Mike test, ICF fusion moved from just another fusion technology of promise to a practical fusion technology that could be repeatedly demonstrated on demand.This puts ICF fusion in a slightly different position than any other form of fusion today. Technical demonstration of ignition has been experimentally demonstrated. A practical form of ICF fusion has been experimentally shown to repeatedly work in independent experiments fielded by both LLNL and LANL Field Test Divisions over the course of ~10 years (Halite-Centurion series tests).After more than sixty years of experiments in hundreds of different experimental fusion devices and hundreds of thousands of separate shots, only ICF fusion has experimentally demonstrated fusion ignition and fusion net energy generation.For a brief period in the mid-1970s (Nixon Administration), the major US DOE Labs considered building practical fusion reactors based on the form of ICF nuclear fusion we currently can reliably achieve. These experiments and designs were part of PACER program, which was only active as a project for about 3 years and did not result in actual fusion reactor hardware (but which did result in preliminary ultra-clean PACER device designs which efficiently maximize production of energy from fusion while minimizing the energy from fission required to initiate each fission-fusion shot). Project PACER also produced preliminary PACER reactor designs.PACER fusion - ""PACER Revisited"" -The Nixon Administration, in a mid-1970s effort intended to try to keep a campaign promise to balance the Federal Budget, cut both Thorium Molten Salt Reactor and PACER Fusion research as cost cutting measures at approximately the same time.The Dr. Ralph Moir ""PACER Revisited"" paper contains a description of the LLNL small closer to commercial molten salt version of PACER.http://www.ralphmoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pacerRev891.pdfIn the intervening 40 years advances in design of pure fusion experimental devices have been made (but no experimental pure fusion devices have as yet been built or successfully tested).Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). In the final few years on underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has been experimentallyIf fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.[1] - NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

On the other hand, there are also ""amateur"" scientists working in their garages -- their devices are much smaller (and fit the tiny budgets they have).If the government research pans out, except for potential environmental improvements, there won't be a major change to society when fusion comes online. Although raw fuel costs may be reduced, the same distribution methods will be required and the capital costs will remain astronomical.At the other extreme, one can imagine a ""lucky"" inventor developing a small fusion reactor in his basement that powers micro-grids. If this happens, the cost of energy will plummet over the following twenty five years. Fuel costs go to essentially zero. Distribution and transmission costs (over 40% of the cost today) are substantially reduced or eliminated. The remaining costs are capital expenditures and maintenance. Depending on the shielding required, these devices may be inexpensive to build. Maybe like today's portable generators, but with a containment vessel. In this highly speculative scenario, electricity might be as low as 1/10th of today's cost. If so, electricity availability worldwide will grow substantially.(The same thing can be said of other clean/renewable, micro-grid capable sources. Fusion's advantage is that it 'burns' a fuel and is therefore available 24/7. The advantage of the other sources is that they're real and available today)Regardless of the scenario, large or small, if fusion comes online at a price-point significantly below fossil fuel systems, oil-propped regimes will teeter and fail. Wars may break out in the middle-east. But, because oil will be much less important, outside meddling will be significantly reduced. Also, several of the world's largest companies will become irrelevant.If the cost of energy falls (and AI takes over), the cost of ground and sea transportation will becomes primarily a capital expense. Because shielding is heavy, air travel will remain fossil-fuel based until aneutronic reactors are available, small, and light.If fusion (or any of the clean/renewables) takes off in a way that obviates fossil fuels, the environment stops incurring the associated deleterious effects.If fusion reduces the financial and carbon costs sufficiently, many projects become much more viable, such as desalination plants and energy-intensive carbon-capture processes. Maybe we can start repairing the environmental damage already done.The cost of energy is embedded in virtually everything we use. Aluminum, for example, is created using massive amounts of electricity. The food we eat requires energy to plant, grow, harvest, process, transport, sell, and cook. Offices and homes are illuminated, heated, and cooled. The device you're reading this uses electricity.Reducing the cost of energy means everyone has a bit more for themselves. The energy sector is about a five trillion dollar industry, a bit over $500 per person annually. The average annual worldwide per-capita income is under $3,500. So, if energy costs are reduced substantially, the entire world will benefit.Maybe fusion will do some or all of this for us.

Because once ""fossil energy"" use up, aren't we dependent on hydropower, solar energy, wind energy to drive particle accelerators? Go mining minerals and launch rockets!? Stop dreaming. It’s bad enough if every household can only turn on a little light ~The following are pessimistic predictions (TL;DR):Sadly, unlike most people think, technological progress is not accelerated. It may be that some technical threshold is too high, leading to the inability of most civilizations to cross and to conduct interplanetary navigation.Humans have spent nearly 60 years on controllable nuclear fusion, and the substantial progress is basically 0. Even if the world is united, ITER's engineering progress is still delayed. In the history of human science, no technology has taken such a long time, seemingly within reach, but there is no way to break through.I hazarded that Controlled nuclear fusion technology is The Great Filter.The reason why the universe is deadly silent is probably that there is a threshold in the process of civilization development, which causes most or all civilizations to fail to cross it.What is the threshold? It is to master nuclear energy technology!There are near-infinite hydrogen and helium in our universe. If we master nuclear fusion technology, it means that our civilization can leave the planet of our born, and we will survive for a long time in interstellar space. Even leave our galaxy to explore the wider universe.There are near-infinite hydrogen and helium in our universe. If we master nuclear fusion technology, it means that our civilization can leave the planet of our born, and we will survive for a long time in interstellar space.Any civilization that can achieve controllable nuclear fusion obtains an almost infinite negative entropy flow theoretically. Even if there is no qualitative change at the technical level, it can survive for nearly ever. At this stage of civilization, the cost of launching unmanned detectors will become low. In the continuation of the almost infinite civilization, the number of detectors that will eventually be launched will reach an astonishing level.If we realize the controllable nuclear fusion, our aerospace propulsion technology may undergo qualitative changes, which is far from being achieved by the so-called new energy. At that time, the speed of the spacecraft will be significantly improved, and navigation within the stellar system will become easy. We will become a true fourth-order civilization--We can build a spacecraft, even if it is gone, but the controlled nuclear fusion technology makes the ecological self-circulation system possible. The spacecraft can last for millions of years. Some detectors will start from generation to generation and fly to the starry sky.Considering the distribution of resources in the universe (mostly light elements), any civilization that recognizes the principle of stellar luminescence is a rational choice for solving energy and power.If people in developing countries around the world want to live like in developed countries, we need about 4.5 earths resources, then we must find various resources we need from space. They are in the solar system. The limits of the earth's resources can only feed 100 billion people, and the resources of the solar system can feed 10^16 people, equivalent to 100,000 earths:The meaning of controlled nuclear fusion cannot be overestimated.Where is the alien detector?In theory, as long as we can reach the fourth level, even if we are eventually trapped in our solar system, the cost of launching unmanned detectors will so low that leave a lot of traces in the universe. This is the same for other civilizations.Alien wisdom life may have been destroyed by its own reasons. These reasons may include nuclear war, bioterrorism or the reverse elimination of civilization. But even so, some of their technical achievements should be preserved.In fact, we humans have already done this: Voyager 1 has reached dozens billion miles outside the Earth. In just a few decades, humans have launched many detectors before and after. Even if humanity is completely destroyed as a race, we will at least have five human exploration devices wandering outside the solar system, telling the story of human civilization.Human civilization will undoubtedly continue to launch probes into the universe in the future, and the number will not be small.There are astronomical stars in the universe, so there may be astronomical civilizations and definitely not only that the earth can evolve civilization.. As long as they can evolve to a higher level than the current level of human technology, the cost of launch is considerably reduced, and the number of detectors launched will fill the universe.Why is the universe deadly silent? That's some fridge-horror!!Let's make such a rough estimate: the Milky Way's diameter is about 100,000 light-years. A highly intelligent civilization, even at a speed of one-thousandth of the speed of light, can only cross the Milky Way for 100 million years. This time is much smaller than the age of the Milky Way (10 billion years). Therefore, if the wisdom civilization that emerged earlier than human beings spreads outward, it should have spread throughout the galaxy and even the entire universe.One possible implementation is the automaton (Von Neumann type machine), a self-replicating machine: alien civilizations launch many micro-automatic machines outward, landing in suitable environments such as planets and satellites, comets, etc.They collect raw materials and create next-generation automata; then starting from the landing point, continue to expand outward. Such an automaton can detect galaxies of the Milky Way size within 500,000 years if it has 5% of the speed of light. If there are civilizations in the Milky Way that are more than 500,000 years ahead of the Earth, humans should have observed this wisdom civilization.As of today, human exploration of the universe has made great strides. Within the solar system, all planets and a number of important satellites have spacecraft to survey, and asteroids and comets have also launched special detectors for research; for stars outside the solar system, humans have been listening to radio signals from them; Humans can even use telescopes to observe relatively close stars, find the planets around them from the light intensity and spectrum of stars, and analyze the size, structure, composition of the atmosphere, surface temperature and other information. All these search operations have so far found no signs of alien civilization.The earliest civilization recognized at present is the Sumerian civilization, about 5,000 years old. If there are a large number of civilizations that can sail freely in the stellar space, their means of observation should far exceed the current level of human technology. In the 5,000-year history, why are there no records of visits by aliens or shape detectors? So far, human history has not left a record of following the rules of reason, indicating the existence of alien civilization.The universe is full of silence. For thousands of years, humankind has been unable to discover other alien civilizations through various means. It feels that the vast cosmos is like a great wasteland. There is no such thing except for human beings.The silence is unreasonable: the conditions for the earth to produce our civilization are not harsh, the time is not long, the universe is so big, the time it takes is so long, how can it be only one earth Civilization?This means that it is difficult for civilization to master nuclear fusion technology. There may be almost no civilization to cross this level!?From the current theoretical reserve, technical level and complexity development trend, the difficult to pass the sieve is the key technology from the third-level civilization to the fourth-level - controllable nuclear fusion.“Since nuclear fusion is so difficult to master, let's try to master it slowly? It takes only 10,000 years for human beings to enter agricultural civilization, and it has only been a few hundred years since entering industrial civilization…anyway, don’t we have lived well now?”Think about it. If it is only a matter of time, then other ancient civilizations in our universe have existed for billions of years.2. The fossil energy is UnsustainableThe cruellest fact of this is that if our civilization can't break through this barrier in a short time after we mastering chemical energy, we will permanently lose this opportunity!!The reason is simple - the bio-energy used by agricultural civilization is a continuous transformation from solar energy, but the petroleum, coal, and natural gas on which the Fossil Energy used by industrial civilization depend on the precious savings of solar energy in the past hundreds of millions of years on the earth.We are currently consuming a lot of fossil energy to leech off their earth's capital, because oil and coal are the legacies of human settlement after hundreds of millions of years of precipitation. It is estimated that at the current rate of human industrialization, the fossil energy of the earth will be hundreds of years later. The consumption is exhausted, and the nuclear fission uranium reserves are limited, and the research on thermonuclear fusion has not progressed.I believe that the division of civilization levels can be marked by the distance that the group can reach:We can now say that we have reached the third level. Even if we do what we can, we can reach Mars barely with the help of chemical rockets, but we are powerless to go to other planets. Flying out of the solar system is far from reach.Traditional energy sources are exceptionally inefficient, and it is difficult to provide the power needed for high-speed of Spacecraft. The chemical engine rockets are hard to reach Kepler 452b even if we burn out all the fossil energy in the earth to support it!!From the beginning of the development of such Fossil Energy to the end of the day when these energy sources are exhausted, if we cannot master nuclear energy, our entire industrial civilization will game over~Because there is no more oil and coal to support social development and higher technology research, human beings will lose the opportunity to move toward a god-level civilization and be trapped on this small earth forever!Our earth civilization has entered a crucial point! In this dark cosmic forest, the fossil energy on the planet is a small match. We must use it to ignite the fusion reactor before the match is burned:From the perspective of the silence of the universe, the possibility of human breakthrough success is minimal. The sieve in front of it may be the ultimate fate of humankind. The endless starry sky is the driving force of human progress, but it may also be the goal that human beings will never reach?Are we humans have not left the cradle of the earth but die in this cradle? Desperate!?3. How should we escape the Earth, the ""Easter Island"" in the solar system?""Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed""Easter Island is an island in the Pacific Ocean—The surface area of ​​the Earth is aboutOur planet is also a single one in the vast universe—the Solar System is aboutThe Easter Island is a microcosm of the earth:The tragedy of Easter Island is astounding, and the rampage of technology gimmicks makes me feel the need to remind everyone:Easter Island is an appropriate metaphor for the dilemmas of the human.Our current earth society is like the situation in Easter Island in 1600 -Even with the technological advances, we can make at this negative entropy level, the oil on Earth can sustain less than 300 years. But don't forget that in the past 50 years, our progress in nuclear fusion technology has been 0!On the other hand, the trend of globalization and human rights in the past few decades has brought about the hedonism and money worship in the world. Plus, the entropy growth rate needed to maintain the increasingly luxurious life of humankind is incredible. If human society does not undergo revolutionary changes, the done of our community will eventually become a foregone conclusion.Environmentalists say: ""We can't pin the future of mankind on a completely unreliable adventure."" Yes, because of energy problems, we give up to explore space, give up resources of 100,000 Earths in the solar system, and just huddle in this small blue planet, we will pin our future to the cause of environmental protection and live a life of thrift.The irony is that even a green life-saving energy can't stop the ecological economy from collapsing. The only thing that can be successful in environmental protection is to prevent development immediately. But once the capitalist behemoth stops developing, our societies will entirely collapse.negative entropy flowLooking back at human history is a history of chasing negative entropy. In the early stages, if we overproduce in a specific area and eat up the output on the ground, we will migrate to a place with food. We have stepped out of the African savanna slowly. Migration is the most common means for human civilization to solve the pressure of survival. In the end, human beings are spread all over the world.Now, we may have indeed encountered a big problem.The acquisition cost of the negative entropy flow is getting higher and higher, which will have a significant impact on our social structure. For taking precautions, humans may need to change some of the ideas that have developed over the past 300 years, and don't make it for granted that technology will last forever. It is irresponsible to base the future of civilization on the illusion that technology continues to explode.But what I must emphasize is thatMaintaining the current industrial civilization requires massive negative entropy--The energy that humans need every year is so great that fossil energy that has been formed for hundreds of millions of years will be exhausted in hundreds of years.The nuclear fission resources are limited, and now only account for a small proportion of human primary energy consumption. If nuclear fission is used, there will be a breeder reactor, and the time that can be supported is limited. Even if humans can penetrate the earth's crust and acquire deep resources, humans ignite in a closed room, and the accumulation of toxic gases in the atmosphere will kill the future of mankind!4. Is the resource-limited or the end of the border?""Since there are so many resources, the level that modern technology can achieve is enough for the public to have a good day. Why do we have to rush out of the earth?""Compared with interstellar travel or nuclear war, all human beings who have gained democracy are most likely to indulge in wearing VR headsets, jerk off or even the electrode directly stimulates the brain. After all, this is more likely to be the future of human civilization.Many systems and concepts of modern human society—freedom, democracy, and equality—are cultivated in the era of technological advancement and gradually opening up new frontiers.In 1893, at the annual meeting of the American Historical Society in Chicago,The election of Donald Trump can also be seen as a result of the contraction of the US frontier.The Case for Mars The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We MustAncient Chinese civilization is a living example--After the middle of the Tang Dynasty, with the fixed frontier of China's agricultural civilization, there was no new room for expansion, and the Chinese culture attracted a period of technological stagnation.The geographical environment of ancient Chinese civilization is unique. The desert in the northwest, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the west, the tropical jungle in the southwest, the snow-covered tundra in the north and the sea in the east make it difficult for Chinese civilization and other civilizations at the same level to communicate on a large scale.In contrast, the exchanges around the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean are much more frequent. Therefore, the degree of isolation between ancient Chinese civilization and other major civilizations is second to none on the Eurasian continent, resulting in the difference between Chinese civilization and them far more prominent than the differences between the remaining civilizations (except for the ancient Native American civilizations that were extinct).Ancient Chinese civilization, especially the Chinese civilization after the Qin and Han Dynasties, was far ahead in the East Asian region. Chinese civilization entered an era of technological stagnation early. In the history of more than 1,000 years, due to the inherent structural characteristics of Chinese civilization, it has never opened the door to the era of great navigation and industrialization. The space limit and technological stagnation eventually led to the Chinese civilization began to fall into the Malthusian dilemma after the middle Tang Dynasty, and the chaos cycle appeared again and again.After the technology stagnation, the technology spread, and the surrounding barbarians narrowed the gap with the Central Plains dynasty in military technology. Therefore, the barbarian regime after the Tang Dynasty has far more combat power and difficulty than the previous Xiongnu and Turkic.The Chinese civilization began to turn to monolithic, and the concentration of authoritarianism was increasing, which in turn inhibited the development of technology.If without external involvement (Western expansion), Chinese civilization will be trapped in its own paradigm until the farming environment has completely collapsed.Therefore, expanding space is the most significant thing for us. If there is no front line for growth and no new space for technological development, Malthusianism will come true—In a closed area, the thermodynamic equilibrium is a nightmare for all, and the diversity of human society will be.The scary thing is that the entropy increase of human society is high now. Not necessarily waiting for resources to run out,The R&D mechanism formed in the past 100 years seems to be unable to cope with the new technological ladder. Where is the problem? Any device that has been running for a long time will ""bad money driving out good money,"" resulting in an increase in the entropy value within the system. Many factors are constraining the release of human potential, and the R&D mechanism itself needs a paradigm revolution.This problem is real. It is related to the survival of human beings. When you think about it, it will be deeply imprinted into your mind.The dark clouds of Easter Island have been hovering over the top of human beings. While each of us is going to work every day, earning money, raising a family, and making a living, but please don’t forget that we are human beings:Even if we end up noting the fate of the wheel of the universe, we should die with dignity, and this dignity requires you, me and all human members to cast together~","29,752 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

The small Israeli reactor was spherical in shape and was powered by a solution of Am-242(NO3)3 in water. When a fission reactor is very small in size (<10 cm radius sphere) it requires relatively less combined shielding to fully enclose the reactor with an adequate gamma and neutron shield. Really small fission reactors become much more practical if good light weight and compact shielding approaches are used.The minimum critical mass (water reflected) that can be formed is 6.6 g of Am-242m.Los Alamos has recent experience building truly small nuclear reactors using many off the shelf components to reduce cost. LANL is currently testing their kilowatt power space fission reactor called KRUSTY (KilowattSmall fusion reactors for providing power tend to be discounted because no one to date has built a fusion reactor that actually generates net power.Fusion has however many significant advantages for truly small nuclear power generation applications -Some advantages of fusion for building truly small reactors.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion.

Hydrogen (and deuterium) are the most abundant elements in the universe, fully 10^10 times more abundant than any combination of fission fuels.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Fast Neutrons are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield than penetrating fission produced gammas.While laboratory pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has worked since 1952) producing fusion power reliably on demand[2].Proton-Boron-11 fusion is a current interest for the fusion community. p-B11 fusion produces primarily alpha-particles which are easy to shield and have attractive intrinsic safety features for human operators - all of which is vital for a small reactor application. While p-B11 is expected to produce a few neutrons through side reactors, this style of fusion is a good candidate for safely powering small reactor applications.Inertial Confinement Fusion of p-B11 fuel for small reactor applicationsIt has been calculated that ion temperatures of DT ignited targets reach very high values, exceeding 200 keV. This is the temperature above which proton-boron 11 fusion reactivity arrives to high enough levels to be relevant for energy production (and to obtain high fusion energy gain). In the same DT explosion wave, electron temperatures remain at a lower value, usually below 100 keV, which is a helpful feature to reduce radiation and conduction losses from the plasma. A scheme potentially can be devised to exploit proton-boron 11 fusion by using an Inertial Confinement staged fusion device design initiating a controlled fusion deflagration wave in a p-B11 fusion secondary stage while using a much smaller DT “spark” primary stage. This maximizes the production of fusion energy from p-B11 while reducing the size and cost of the required ICF fusion driver (laser or particle beam).[1] - Y.

7,"I think your question has some built-in assumptions which are likely off the mark. Fusion spending is going towards something better than fission…and I say that as a guy developing next generation reactors. There are fusion concepts with no moving parts, no radiation, no activated components, and 80–90% electrical conversion efficiency. Fission, even in the most optimistic Gen V fission-product, plasma-suspended concepts can’t get there. Fusion is a better, albeit insanely difficult, mousetrap.

As someone who believes that A) I’m nowhere near good enough at math to find the solution to fusion and B) The perfect is the enemy of the good; I’m gonna keep working on better fission reactors, which is something I can get my head around. So with that in mind, you ask why not build thorium reactors…I am going to assume you mean thorium in a molten salt with no definable fuel structure…aka LFTR. If not, Westinghouse actually already built and (a utility) ran a thorium reactor in Pittsburgh and sold its power for years (Shippingport). However, the contention that thorium reactors are easy to develop and necessarily safer than uranium or plutonium reactors is false. LFTRs are very challenging to develop and it is very hard to make a case that they are, in fact, safer than the best current reactor technologies. Today, AP1000 plants, ESBWR, and NuScale are so safe that it becomes very difficult to numerically improve on them. Trust me…I’ve tried twice and we’ve basically broken probabilistic risk assessment (i.e., we couldn’t really get a better safety number). Nuclear plants do not need to get safer, they need to get cheaper and faster to build. Sometimes, the properties which allow your reactor to be cheap also allow it to be safe, and that’s when you win (that’s what I like to think the lead-cooled fast reactor I’m developing will do).So why are MSRs/LFTRs not just braindead exercises to develop? Why is it not a conspiracy led by big, evil organizations like Westinghouse and GE to keep us on “outdated” technology? I shall plagiarize myself.Here’s a post I wrote for a Coursera course I was TA’ing. Some of the points may be slightly debatable (or not applicable to all MSR/LFTR designs), but I hope it paints a clear picture as to the difficulty in MSRs. It can also be said that rarely is one challenge eliminated without another one coming up…so be careful what you write away with a “well I can get rid of graphite by using X” or something like that. I can say, having spoken to contemporaries at different, and well-known companies (and National Labs) beside my own (Westinghouse) that I am not alone in this thinking. Lastly, I must say that this really represents my personal thoughts on the issues and not those of my employer.I'm going to focus on the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR) because that seems to be the most popular.So first, let me cover the basic operational theory and advantages of a LFTR. The idea is that you'd have a molten salt coolant. This coolant is comprised of fluoride, lithium, and beryllium. This forms two salts, lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. This coolant has great properties in heat capacity, boiling point, vapor pressure, and neutronics. This makes it relatively transparent to neutrons, a great heat conductor, and it maintains a low pressure in the vessel, allowing operation at atmospheric pressure. Fluoride salts are extremely stable and therefore well suited to a high-radiation environment. Additionally, the fission products (which I'll speak to in a bit) tend not to form compounds with the beryllium, lithium, or fluoride.Interspersed with the salt is the fuel, in this case thorium and some form of seed material (uranium or plutonium). The salt/fuel mixture passes through a “core” where graphite moderator resides as well as a control device. The fissioning happens in this “core,” heating the mixture and irradiating the thorium. The thorium is bred into uranium 233 through this irradiation. The uranium 233 is an excellent fissile fuel (as opposed to the fertile thorium) and sustains continued reactions. Or course this fission releases a nasty brew of fission products. What's nice in a LFTR is that the salt is constantly filtered and these are removed. This means there is never a large amount of decay heat present in the reactor system. It also means that xenon and samarium don't build up. These are strong neutron absorbers and ultimately limit how much uranium is burned in a normal PWR (hence why we still have about 1% U235 and 0.7% Pu when we're done burning). Also, as there is low decay heat, low pressure, and the system is designed for a molten/solid mixture already--”meltdowns” don't really happen, nor does a reactor accident with a lot of energy driving fission product release. Leaks tend to be self healing too, as the salt will solidify, plugging the leak.Some other advantages include less activated metals in the core. The salt, fuel, and graphite see the majority of neutron radiation. Only a small amount of metal sees significant neutron flux. This makes decommissioning easier in some ways (more on that later). LFTRs also don't produce much in the way of long term waste. As the mixture is constantly filtered, elements don't stay in the coolant long enough to build up to long-lived transuranics. In fact, they also are particularly good at fissioning some of these long-lived elements as well, making them good burner reactors too without some of the difficulties of fast reactors. They also produce lots of useful medical and rare earth isotopes/materials. The processing pulls these out in usable, commercial amounts. Lastly, the high temperatures allow for high efficiencies in the thermodynamic cycle. This has a huge impact on plant economics.Of course, not everything is roses. There are numerous challenges/difficulties with LFTRs.A primary one is lithium 6 contamination in the salt. While pure lithium 7 is produced for reactors today (lithium hydroxide used to alkalize reactor chemistry), it is unbelievably expensive (~$1000/kg) and its manufacture carefully controlled by the government. The amount of lithium 6 allowed in an MSR's salt is astonishingly low as well, making it likely that any separation process will be expensive (not to mention the quantity which needs to be generated). Beryllium is also VERY expensive (also around $1000/kg).Another consideration for a lot of MSRs (and the LFTR in particular), is the fact that fission products and transuranics are purified out of the coolant/fuel constantly. This has lots of advantages, but also causes certain proliferation challenges which are very frequently glossed over. As was mentioned, an initial seed material is typically needed. This comes in the form of a high-enriched uranium typically. So, you're starting with an HE material (proliferation risk), producing Pu239 from the U238 present and then filtering it before it forms Pu240 (aka high grade Pu239: proliferation risk). Additionally, the filtering of the salts can also pulls out protactinium. This gives access to high grade U-233, a bomb material (used in the Davy Crocket W-54 warhead). Lastly, filtering also gives access to neptunium which is judged by U.S. Weapons designers as similar to U235 in weapons usability. It's difficulty of production has prevented its use in warheads (at least to my knowledge), but it remains a very impressive weapons material.The fact that the fuel is actually in the coolant and suspended through the entire loop poses some challenges as well. From a controllability standpoint, LFTRs are challenged by delayed neutrons. Delayed neutrons are the magic gift from God that allow reactors to have easy steady state control. Basically the majority of neutrons needed to keep the reaction critical are prompt...aka they occur directly from other fissions and, given the timescales involved, can cause very fast changes in power. However, a small percentage of neutrons are delayed, in that they come from the decay of fission products. There are 6 groups of delayed neutron emitters we look at in reactor physics. They emit neutrons with timescales in the few second to couple minute range. This means we can “creep up” on criticality. With the coolant circulation time, roughly half of these are lost, meaning the reactor has to operate closer to prompt criticality. This is a situation where enough prompt neutrons are available to drive fast power changes. This means LFTRs will be less stable during fast transients. The thermal properties of the salt and graphite likely will mean this isn't a safety risk, but an unstable reactor is still not a good thing for an operator, regulator, or commercial venture.The presence of fuel and fission products throughout the RCS also causes other challenges. The delayed neutrons lost outside of the core (mentioned previously) will introduce low-level material activation all throughout the RCS. Additionally, the incredibly complex mixture of fission products now floating around results in plating out of noble metals. This is challenging in maintenance and decommissioning space due to contamination and is also a concern for heat exchanger performance, flow path area reduction, and in the potentially deleterious impacts on mechanical components like valves, pumps, control mechanisms etc. Some of the fission products are also corrosive or damaging (like tellurium), attacking some of the high-grade metals typically used in reactors (my PhD friend cites this as another primary challenge). I'm sure the NRC and other regulating bodies will have a field day with the “What-ifs” caused by this potential.The use of graphite in the core is challenging for several reasons. One is the fact that graphite in areas of high neutron flux tends to degrade quickly over time. It swells, builds up internal stresses, and generally becomes unusable over time. It is likely that the graphite would need replaced frequently (estimates of 4 years were given in the 1960s). Graphite also tends to have increasingly favorable moderation properties for U233 as temperature increases. This leads to a positive thermal reactivity coefficient (aka, more temperature = faster reaction). This is no bueno in reactor design. Unfortunately, the designs required to avoid this make thorium breeding more challenging. So it's going to be a strong regulatory challenge to balance breeding, safety, and regulatory confidence (safety and regulatory confidence aren't always the same thing).Lastly, if you happen to screw up operationally, you could end up having frozen salts in your reactor loop. Liquifying these salts could prove rather difficult, although not impossible. This is not totally dissimilar to the Russian Alfa sub reactors which used lead bismuth coolant. They needed constant heating when the cores were not critical. Occasionally this was lost and the reactors froze solid, destroying them. I believe there are solutions which have been devised, I just worry more about the required inspections after liquefying the salt again. I'm sure it would be a long and arduous process. Lots of ""what-ifs"" again.Keep in mind that none of the above challenges are impossible to design around. What scares me more than the ability to formulate a solution is the ability to both formulate the solution and get it licensed. And while some might dismiss the proliferation risks, I think all of them are technically more feasible from a weapons creation standpoint than anything that exists in a LWR, yet we are still hounded by proliferation concerns with little basis in reality. So I think the LFTR would prove a juicy target for people of that mindset. I think China's LFTR program will likely find success. They have the right combination of unlimited funding, an open regulator, and no public interference allowed which can make things like this happen.I welcome LFTRs, FHRs, Gas Reactors, and other novel options. More the merrier is my opinion. What irks me is the attitude that some have which is that ""X"" new technology is so straight forward and simple that we should stop what we're doing, abandon it, and immediately shift our focus to the new thing. At some point you have to say, ""This is what we have right now, it's a good technology, and we're moving forward with it."" Often, the perfect is the biggest enemy of the good...especially when you're dealing with the timescales present. According to some, our window for climate change is measured in a small number of decades (BTW, I do not offer opinion on climate change...outside of my expertise). Our timetables on the U.S. grid stability is shorter still. As such, I think moving forward with today's excellent LWRs (AP1000, EPR, APWR, ABWR, ESBWR, VVER-TOI/AES2006) is a smart move. I don't see any imminent danger with moving forward with those models.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.4K,47.3K,779.4M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

The problem is that it is not happening; mostly as a result of how we regulate fission nuclear in the US (and in allied Western nations).Current law and regulatory obstacles to innovation raises the cost of commercial development of new fission reactors to levels that price out of participation all but the largest nuclear industry participants. It currently costs a nuclear startup approximately US$1 billion to prepare the document package for an NRC reactor design certification action - and the full cost must be provided by the nuclear startup up front a decade before any potential sales of the new reactor can occur. The current innovation environment for fission power generation is unfriendly, to the point that no new technology nuclear reactor (other than Naval reactors and ultra-small reactors for NASA deep space missions) have been commercially introduced and physically built in four decades. The first AP-1000s Gen-III+ LWRs are now under construction in the US, but have not yet been completed (and given developments of the last year - may not be completed ever). The historical record of completed fission reactors versus reactor project started and then abandoned in the US since NRC became nuclear regulator is dismal - with more reactor projects abandoned than completed under NRC regulatory supervision.Current Obstacles to fission reactor innovation -If you want to innovate and build a fission reactor you need from NRC -1) A design certification to ensure your basic reactor design is safe – cost ~$200 million2) A COL license to allow you to construct and operate your fission reactor – cost ~ $60 million3) Once licensed, you will have to pay each year an operating fee to NRC of ~$5 million dollars whether your reactor is operating or not – whether it is producing electricity or process heat or not.4) A license to obtain fission nuclear fuel for your prototype reactor must be obtained from NRC - private sale or purchase of nuclear fuels is illegal and can result in jail time.5) A Waste Confidence Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared and submitted to NRC to describe how you plan to sequester any nuclear waste produced by your fission reactor prototype. NRC must approve your plan before you are allowed to let your reactor to go critical and produce any fission power. Your will need to pay NRC staff evaluating your Environmental Impact Statement at a rate of $265 an hour until such time as NRC staff are satisfied with all elements of your plan.6) When you decide you can no longer continue operating your prototype reactor, you will have to pay NRC during reactor decommissioning. Former reactor operators are required to pay NRC staff at a rate of $265 per hour of time they are involved in supervising the decommissioning of your reactor prototype.In contrast, the regulatory obstacles for Fusion innovation –1) No regulatory obstacles currently exit in the US preventing prototyping of fusion reactors.2) You can freely and legally build fusion reactors in your home basement or at school without interference of any kind from NRC.3) You can legally buy high purity fusion fuels (D2O – which can be electrolyzed to 99.99% pure Deuterium) on e-Bay for less than $10.4) OPEN SOURCE design guides and plans can be freely downloaded on the internet for several good fusion reactor designs.

Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).The energy required from a fusion driver to successfully ignite small sub-gram DT ICF fusion capsules has been experimentally shown[1] to be about 20 MJ delivered to a 2mm spot in less than 3 nanoseconds. 20 MJ is the amount of energy released when burning 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline. The requirements of He3-He3 fuson are expected to be about 40X requirements for DT ICF fusion.Small fusion reactors with low shielding requirements powered by He3-He3 aneutronic fusion will probably arise at some point in our future.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

So keeping it confined with powerful magnetic fields is the primary challenge.The problem is that plasma isFluid dynamics, the study of gases and liquids in motion, requires very powerful computers to model with fine enough detail to be useful. This is why supercomputers have proved so essential in fields like aerodynamic design and weather prediction.Now, try to imagine how challenging it is to model a fluid that experiences turbulence and convection and all the phenomena that gas does, but is moving far faster, is far hotter, and is simultaneously influenced by and creating electromagnetic fields and electric currents. The mind boggles.Still, progress is being made. Some very smart people are chipping away at understanding how fusion plasma works and how to control it, but as you can see, they have their work cut out for them.Edit: To elaborate a bit since this is getting views, the success of magnetic confinement fusion is often measured with a metric called the “triple product.” This is confinement time x density x temperature. All of these are of course important. Temperature and density both affect your power output; higher densities and temperatures yield more energy per cubic meter, which is important as far as getting more energy out than you put in.So, why am I focusing on confinement? Heating the plasma isn't difficult, it's keeping it hot (which means keeping the most energetic nucleii from wriggling through your confinement fields). And higher density also requires stronger confinement fields. So both density and temperature are contingent on keeping the plasma contained. Stability is more important than field strength, too: instabilities can build and overwhelm the strongest fields. Hence the importance of understanding the minutiae of magnetohydrodynamics, and the incredibly complex modeling and math required.Again, progress is being made.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

This takes a finite amount of time. The absorption reaction is energy dependent, and so, not all absorptions cause fission. Before all possible fission reactions have occurred, the bomb blows itself apart, and fissioning and energy release ceases. Fission bombs are limited to ~800 kilotons of TNT yield.Fusion reactions do not depend on neutron absorption, but rather merely on energy density. Fusion bombs use a fission bomb as the trigger to reach the energy density that causes fusion. The intense energy released by fission causes a rapid rise in temperature and pressure, which simultaneously affects all of the fusion fuel. Fusion elements are small, and a relatively huge number of them can be packed into a small space, as compared to fission fuel elements. A much higher fraction of fuel reactions can occur in a fusion bomb before it blows itself apart.Russia once detonated a fusion bomb… the Tsar Bomb… that yielded 50–60 Megatons. The bomb was originally designed to yield 100 Mton, but was scaled back. Theoretically, there is no upper limit to the yield of a fusion bomb. So long as there is fuel available and the conditions to cause fusion the conditions are self-propagating.Fission reactors are less attractive than fusion reactors for several reasons not having to do with the amounts of power they can produce. First, and foremost, fission reactors produce long-lived radioisotopes that must be dealt with. The spent fuel of uranium reactors contains Pu239, an excellent fissile material for bomb-making which must be guarded lest it fall into the hands of terrorists. Fission reactors utilize a “coolant” to transfer heat from the core. Leaks of high-temperature coolant can be disastrous. In the case of water coolant, steam explosions are possible. Fissioning fuel creates radioactive fission fragments, which continue to release significant amounts of energy by radioactive decay even after fissioning stops. This “decay heat” lasts for several minutes after the reactor is shut down and, in cases where core cooling is lost, can lead to melting fuel and the release of extremely hazardous radioisotopes.The easiest to produce fusion reaction of deuterium and tritium creates only relatively short half-life radioisotopes in structural materials (by neutron activation). Although tritium release is potential, tritium is not highly hazardous. It is easily dispersed in air, emits a weak 15 kev beta, and cycles out of the human body (as water) with a biological half-life of 7–14 days. When the fusion reaction stops, all power production stops… no “decay heat"". Energy from deuterium-tritium reactors is transferred by neutron absorption in a liquified lithium “blanket” (“primary coolant”) which, in order to power an electric power producing turbine, must boil water. But, the potential for a “steam explosion” is not the same as that posed by the large volume of water as a primary coolant for typical fission reactors.A rare “quenching event” make take place in the superconducting coils of a plasma confinement fusion reactor. A quench happens when the superconductivity of the electromagnet coils is compromised. This sets up a cascade of “de-superconding” conditions resulting in a rapid rise of electrical resistance. When trillions of amps in a superconducting circuit suddenly meet high resistance, the power generated can be explosive. Of course, researchers are fabricating ways to minimize the effects of the onset of a quench.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-nuclear-fusion-more-powerful

This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-nuclear-fusion-more-powerful

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.",825 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-nuclear-fusion-more-powerful

The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-years of energy. In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).There is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between Magnetic Confinement Fusion and Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain. The actual relationship between plasma density and the fusion energy that can be drawn from fusion plasma burning at fusion conditions is not linear but isThe graph below shows the typical plasma density used in current fusion experiments.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments can, however, operate at higher temperatures and much higher, by a factor of 10^10, plasma pressure than Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments like tokamaks (ITER) or stellarators (W7-x). For ICF fusion, D-D fusion of pure deuterium is a practical fusion reaction and will in the future be used for reliable sustained worldwide fusion power generation.D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,4.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

Translated into horsepower, the nuclear aircraft was expected to produce about 400 thousand horse power (300 Megawatts).(300 megawatt = 402 306.6 horsepower)(more information on aircraft nuclear reactors)Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear aircraft propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over any currently proposed nuclear fission based approach -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for aircraft nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield and harvest for driving electrically driven propellers. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on light weight grids suffices).Will there ever be nuclear powered aircraft?Perhaps so (and perhaps sooner than you think).Mankind is currently in possession of a practical fusion technology (fission-fusion) that produces more energy from fusion than it takes to initiate and maintain for a few nanoseconds the fusion reaction.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion isMankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test of 1952 that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion while using nuclear fission to reliably bring Deuterium fusion plasma to fusion conditions.A minimum size fission burst (or alternatively a laser irradiating a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere which implodes initiating D-T fusion) which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a pressurized liquid deuterium-filled tube.A suitable Nuclear Aircraft design -Boeing’s Blaine Rawdon, a Senior Aircraft designer, designed an outstanding large aircraft that would be well suited to aneutronic Inertial Confinement fusion propulsion.

It should be perhaps compared side by side in detail:CostCost of nuclear fuel is negligible both for fusion and fission, in both cases the main part of electricity cost would be amortization of initial investment to build the machine.Fusion technology (superconductor, vacuum vessels, cryogenic cooling, plasma tech …) is much more technologically advanced, and almost certainly much more costly (per Mega Watt) than fission tech. In contrast fission power is very simple - you just put nearly-critical mass of nuclear fuel to water boiler, and it “burns” by itself (it is almost miracle how easy it is in principle).On the other hand, fission power plant are becoming more and more costly due to added safety features (e.g. huge confinement building around etc.). Since fusion is inherently more safe (there is less stored energy for explosion and much less of radioactive material for leak) it does not require invest so much into added safety. Still I don’t think it will pay off the hugely costly hi-tech. Also new generation fission reactors (Unfavourable property of (fission) nuclear power plant is their size. Large powerplant is cheaper (per Mega Watt). This is even much more true for Tokamak based fusion power plant due to scalling law of magnetic confinement, only multi-Giga-watt reactor can achieve net energy gain (inertial confinement may be different). In this respect it is much more realistic to build small fission reactors than fusion reactors.Radiation safetyFusion reactor produce huge amount of energetic neutrons (while fission neutrons has energy ~2MeV, fusion neutron ~15MeV). These neutrons are hard to shield and cause serious radiation damage to materials.The main advantage of fusion reactor is that the amount of radioactive material stored inside (<1kg plasma) is much lower than in fission reactor (>100ton - including moderator and coolant) which makes huge difference in case of accident. Nevertheless, the mass of irradiated reactor components is comparable. Also if tritium is produced by irradiation of lithium cooling blanket, the volume of radioactive material will be comparable.The other huge advantage is that nuclear fusion istelf (unlike fission) does not produce broad variety of long-live radioactive reaction products (like radioctive iodine, stroncium, or trans-uran actinoides). But very radioctive products can be formed by irradiation of the surrounding structural material by the neutrons. This can be to large degree managed by choice of the materials, although this choice may be limited since the material mus at the same time fullfill other requrements (thermal shielding, strenght, conductivity…).Nuclear ProliferationSince fusion reactor is great neutron source, it can be used to breed various nuclear materials including plutonium-239. But since breeding is based on neutron capture which require slow neutrons (fast neutron cause fission instead), fission reactors with slow neutron spectrum are more suitable for this purpose.Space applicationDespite fission nuclear energy seems to be favourable for common energy generation on Earth, in space it is different story. In space you have plenty of vacuum, cryogenic cooling, but you are limited by mass. Therefore you may prefer to create huge (but light) open magnetic chamber open to ambient vacuum with radiative cooling, rather than 1000ton steel boiler filled with water.The only method how to achieve high specific impulse and high thrust at the same time, is pulsed nuclear power (since it is impossible to continuously confine and cool respective power density). Fusion pulsed power can be miniaturized better than fission pulsed power, since you are not limited by critical mass and low neutron crossection.Also in space Deuterium, Tritium and He-3 is easier to harvest than uranium and thorium.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","29,752 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

Nuclear sourced electricity can also potentially be used to produce synthetic chemical transfer fuels like hydrogen, ammonia, or synthetic diesel fuel that are convenient to use in vehicles and ships.Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion.I believe a multi-axle all wheel drive exploratory vehicle powered by He3-He3 fusion for space planetary exploration might happen in the next two decades - perhaps before any terrestrial fusion vehicle application.Mankind is in possession of a practical fusion technology that produces fusion energy with gain (more energy out of the fusion reaction than is required to bring fusion plasma to fusion conditions). That currently practical fusion technology is called fission-fusion, where nuclear fission is used to reliably produce the conditions for fusion.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are designs for smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion isThe energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium and neutrons).Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over gas and diesel cars -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for fusion car applications and deserve close attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be fusion cars?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary. ICF fusion power plants will probably be smaller than MCF fusion and may ultimately be of a size that could be installed in certain transportation vehicles (ships, trains, planes, trucks, and ultimately cars). What will probably be the most practical way to fusion powered vehicles (of a sort) for perhaps the next fifty years is to use stationary fusion power plants to produce electricity and then to use nuclear fusion produced electricity to charge conventional electric vehicles with storage batteries.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion ----------","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,13.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

To do this you need extremely high temperatures and pressure ( like that in the core of our Sun ). Hydrogen isotopes fuse together to form helium. Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen each second. The products are neutrinos, positrons and gamma rays. Photons and heat are also generatedNuclear fusion, as mentioned before, requires extreme conditions in order to overcome the repulsion between the protons.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it.

If you stood the Pelican on one wingtip, the other wingtip would almost reach the top of a 50-story building. The Pelican would weighs 6 million pounds and has 76 steerable tires to distribute that weight and keep it from turning runways into rubble. The aircraft is planned to be powered by eight 80,000-horsepower turbine engines driving four counter-rotating propellers, each of which is as tall as a five-story building. I believe that the aircraft design would be compatible with fusion nuclear-electric propulsion (in my technical proposal an aneutronic He3-He3 Inertial Confinement Fusion power plant producing nuclear electricity via direct conversion of fusion charged particles [protons and alpha particles] collected on light stationary screens which in turn is used to drive multiple electric motors and props).TheWhile some effort has gone into fission powered bombers some decades ago, this effort never produced a successful nuclear fission bomber prototype - mostly because of shielding related problems and the excessive weight adequate biological shielding would require to keep the aircraft crew and pilots safe.Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear aircraft propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over other alternative power methods including fossil fuel powered jets.Some fusion advantages -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the props of a long haul fusion cargo aircraft. Neutron-less He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive and heavy precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Will there ever be fusion powered Aircraft?Picture of the Boeing Pelican flying at its normal height of 20 feet.I believe that it is possible that the future requirements of international trade may support a fleet of very large fusion powered aircraft that use ground effect over the oceans to increase the load carrying capabilities and performance of the cargo aircraft.The Pelican: A Big Bird for the Long Haul",458 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,14.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-nuclear-fusion-and-nuclear-fission

Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantity or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel-No greenhouse gasses produced-No reactor core meltdowns and no fission product decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)-No mining of fuel is required for several forms of fusion as deuterium fuel is extracted from water. For first generation deuterium-tritium fusion; lithium must be mined and then exposed to a source of neutrons to form tritium fuel.-Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus a few thousand years for uranium based fission and a few hundreds of years for fossil fuels)-1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power (typical nuclear power). Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.-Radioactive waste remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands. DT fusion reactors would burn and require storage of significant quantities of tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not highly hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.-Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)-No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,20.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-nuclear-fusion-and-nuclear-fission

The famous Carrington Event was likely X 40 to X 50 or more. Even then, the flare must be Earth facing to hit Earth to cause problems. In 2003 there was a flare estimated at over X 28 (estimated over X 28 because it went off scale and blinded the Solar detecting satellite sensor), but fortunately, it wasn't Earth facing and missed us. A flare that big, if it had hit could cause worse than world wide radio blackouts. Power outages, and damage to communication satellites would have been likely with an X 28. Fortunately, flares that strong are rare. The 1859 Carrington event is basically a 500 to 1000 year event. There are ice core samples of a solar storm about seven times more powerful than the Carrington Event, about 12,840 years ago. Even an equivalent Carrington event happening today, would knock out power over large country size areas both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres which could take months to restore, not just days or weeks. The effects would also mushroom to limited or no running water, lack of fuel, no banking and big transportation issues from lack of being able to pump fuel.

In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).------Large tokamak magnetic fusion designers often tend to discount the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction because it is not possible to achieve the necessary fusion reaction rates and break-even energy with D-D fusion using tokamaks and stellarator devices such as we currently are able build. The situation is different, however, with Inertial Confinement Fusion which typically employs a fusion plasma that are literally 10^11 times more dense than the typical ion plasma densities used in MCF tokamaks or stellarators.The power than can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the second power of the plasma ion density. Even small improvements in plasma ion density will result in significant improvements in the performance of a fusion experiment.There is an impressively large Range of plasma density in current and planned fusion experimentsThere is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between MCF and ICF fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV-------Fusion and neutronsDT and DD fusion release large amounts of their fusion energy in the form of fast neutrons.The task of shielding fast neutrons requires• Fast Neutrons (E >1 MeV) must first be thermalized with highneutron scattering materials (typically materials that have a high percentage of light atoms like hydrogen)• These thermal neutrons can then be absorbed or shielded with material having high cross sections for neutron absorptionAbsorption of thermalized neutrons can be done by relatively light materials like polyethylene plastic unlike gamma radiation that require lots of high-z material (lead, concrete, water) to absorb the penetrating gamma.LLNL's Dr. Ralph Moir has pioneered several molten salt fusion reactor concepts (HyLife II and PACER Revisited). A thick liquid falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorber like 50 micron particles of Boron Carbide as a slurry can absorb damaging fast neutrons. Such a thick falling wall of molten salt can effectively protect fusion chamber structure and largely prevent neutron activation of fusion reactor materials. This permits molten salt ICF fusion reactors to have long 30+ year commercial lifetimes and to at reactor end of life produce little or no neutron activated waste.Slide comparing fission and various fusion reactions from Professor Gerald KulcinskiThere are actually rather good reasons to believe that when nuclear fusion is commercially introduced, it will in short order form the basis of very commercially competitive power plants that will deliver reliable, cheap energy to all in the world that need energy.Fusion’s near term commercial potential -Not all approaches to nuclear fusion will have identical commercial characteristics. Some approaches to nuclear fusion will not in the end be able to produce any actual energy beyond what is required to operate the fusion experiment and as a result will effectively become fusion research dead ends. Other fusion approaches including some that currently receive high levels of funding and international support may ultimately reach break-even energy, but these approaches to fusion may after scaling end up to extraordinarily complex and impractically huge size may end up being uncompetitive with fossil fuel and renewable energy power plants. Such a large experimental fusion physics demonstration may perhaps be built only a single time as a kind of technology proof of principle, but then go no further and never get built in any significant numbers by communities needing cost competitive electrical power.Plasma Density matters when competing to produce cheap energy -Approaches to fusion that routinely use very low density plasma, like tokamaks (ITER) and stellarators (W7-x) will have to be physically larger and contain a much greater volume of fusion plasma than fusion devices that routinely operate on denser plasma. There is literally a 10^11 difference in operating plasma density at fusion conditions between Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices like tokamaks and stellarators and Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Experiments like NIF. This is a huge natural competitive advantage to ICF fusion in terms of potential commercial competitiveness.Comparison between the fusion chamber volume of an Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment (NIF) versus a Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiment (ITER) -(notice man in lower right corner for scale)Those who advocate Magnetic Confinement fusion devices will be quick to point out however that ICF fusion currently requires a large stationary football field sized laser fusion driver to ignite the small high plasma density ICF fusion capsules. This is true, but the size and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers is dropping very rapidly (and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers are also dropping at a rapid rate) and the impact of the laser fusion driver is destined to be a shrinking contributor to ICF fusion power plant physical size and cost.The power that a pulse laser fusion driver can deliver has increased roughly by a factor of 1000 every decade for the last 40 years. This is in fact a stronger sustained technical advance than even Moore’s law (transistors on a CPU chip).Cost of fusion power generators that can operate using high density fusion plasma -As previously mentioned, the physically smallest and least costly commercial fusion power plants of the future will probably operate using the highest density fusion plasma. Approaches to fusion that cannot operate on a least medium density plasma (10^18 ions/cm^3) will probably not be able to compete, head to head, with fossil fuel or renewable energy power plants.LPP Fusion is currently a private sector small fusion leader in the quest for fusion and is expected to use medium density fusion plasma in their Dense Plasma Focus fusion device. LPP Fusion has produced the following slide as a cost goal for their small modular commercial fusion device.These is a respectably low and impressive cost estimate for small fusion.The Department of Energy EIA's findings suggest that natural gas–fired power plants are cheaper to build with overnight capital costs ranging fromLPP Fusion’s DPF device would be 10X or more cheaper to build and would produce 10X cheaper electricity than the cheapest current form of natural gas power plant.ICF fusion power plants that use the densest fusion plasma have the potential to be the most cost competitive of all small fusion approaches when the technology becomes commercially available.As fusion power plants advance to commercial reality over the next decade, they should improve in power density and decrease in cost.Small Fusion: step by step ferociously, one step at a time.Effort to bring fusion to commercial reality will be rewarded.The investment in fusion technology will be justified and the low cost power that fusion will generate will lift billions of people around the world currently without any access to electricity out of chronic grinding poverty and want.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

3,"No. The amount of energy “trapped” in a nucleon is a U-shaped curve bottoming out at Iron-56. If you fuse nuclei lighter than this, you can get energy out. If you split nuclei heavier than this, you can get energy out. But to go past the minimum you have to put energy in, not get it out.

That’s less than 10% of the energy released by fission!However, if you have equal weights of fuel, then the energy released by fusion is greater.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.",2 followers,Richard Muller,681,2.3K,201.9M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

Also, scientists need several years of testing the device with normal hydrogen before slowly moving to a deuterium and tritium mix that will achieve full power. It's a relatively slow process, requiring numerous tests to ensure that the device is stable and safe.The next step is a prototype fusion power plant, DEMO, to be built in the 2030s if things go as planned. This device, larger than ITER, will attempt to demonstrate that a stable fusion power plant is feasible. Showing that fusion is economically viable is the next step.A discussion of fusion research would be incomplete without mention of the other viable mechanism for controlled fusion, inertial confinement, which uses multiple lasers fired on a pellet of deuterium and tritium to compress and heat the fuel to the necessary density and temperature for fusion chain reactions. Two facilities employing this method are the National Ignition Facility (NIF) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility) and Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMJ). NIF is operating at LLNL in California, and LMJ will be completed in France in 2012. Inertial confinement is currently much less efficient than magnetic confinement, but a ""fast ignition"" device, HiPER (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiPER), claims it will produce fusion gains of 72, far surpassing ITER. HiPER is still in the planning phase, and will probably not be complete before 2020.I'll conclude with a few reasons fusion has been so elusive for the past several decades. Numerous plasma instabilities require large and complicated devices to maintain a stable, high-temperature (100 million K) plasma. Furthermore, sudden disruptions in the plasma cause the walls to be bombarded by this hot gas and dust, and it is hard to find materials that can withstand this repeated abuse. Likewise, scientists must learn to prevent these disruptions as they will be even more powerful in larger devices. For inertial confinement, different instabilities require incredibly powerful and symmetric laser pulses to achieve fusion. More powerful, efficient lasers with the ability to fire at about 10 Hz are required for viable power plants. Each confinement method faces a plethora of other problems to be solved, and I don't have the expertise to go into much more detail. Fusion scientists have made great progress, and they continue to make progress on these many challenges.Original answer from August, 2010. The field may have changed since then, and I’m not as up-to-date as I was back then.

It is an enormous undertaking, on the order of the International Space Station or CERN, but politics and terrible mis-management have continued to plague the progress. A very major change was instituted about 2 years ago, and things have greatly improved since.In any case ITER’s importance cannot be over-stated: there would be no hope for fusion as a potential energy source for mankind without all the research work done worldwide “in support of ITER”. Last month, for example, the 7th (annual) ITER Business Forum was held, with over 1000 (!) delegates attending, from 436 companies and 25 countries. Last October the IAEA (Vienna) organized its 29th FEC - Fusion Energy Conference - in Kyoto (the location changes each time); more than 1400 delegates and over 800 research papers were presented.But fusion energy is much more than ITER. ITER has been the most important catalyst for hundreds of laboratories all over the world, doing work to make fusion happen. In China, in Korea and in Japan are very important world-scale experimental devices, and they will open the path to fusion electricity. In Europe there is very significant activity in almost every country - but especially in the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland. Very unfortunately the US is falling behind, and while the science of fusion has progressed largely due to earlier US activity, and current ideas in the US are at the leading edge, government funding has essentially dried up and private sector funding, while in principle is around, none has been invested in serious fusion technology.Now to your original question: the state of current fusion energy research. In principle there is really only one general method that might prove successful in the medium term, and that is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) of a deuterium/tritium mixture at very high temperatures. Probably 80–90% of the world’s fusion research is on MCF. Temperatures of 150 million degrees, super-conducting magnets, tritium breeding/storage/isolation, first wall blankets, divertors, plasma facing materials and other aspects of the exciting fusion future - we can do these things!And when it happens - when fusion electricity can be made - imagine a world where the fuel for energy weighs one ten-millionth that of the equivalent of coal, and that fuel comes from seawater! Imagine a world with zero-carbon electricity production (and no other greenhouse gas emissions), with no possible explosion, with virtually no radioactive waste, with no oil pipelines or coal-miners dying on a daily basis.“If all this is true why don’t we have it now?” An excellent question.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

I'll also explore a few different scenarios.MarsEnergy required to heat Mars from current average temperature of -60C to a more comfortable 15C (like Earth):Conclusion: Asteroids/comets are tricky propositions, rather energetically painful, and messy. A big enough impact to melt all the permafrost and as a result reconstitute the atmosphere would likely make Mars a terrible place to live. Lots of dust. Dust cools the atmosphere and buries rovers. That said, it's possible that big hits in the past have temporarily warmed the planet for a few million years, and xenobiologists find that exciting.Clearly, some subtlety is called for.Mars' surface temperature is stable, which means all this energy falling on the surface is matched by radiation back out into space. In order to increase the surface temperature, one needs to reduce the amount of back radiation. Greenhouse effect! Greenhouse gasses are not my area of expertise, but I'll make some educated guesses anyway.Water vapour and COThis is electrical energy, which is easier to come by than rocket fuel. Nuclear power would be the way to go, but even solar power could take a decent bite out of this. Especially if solar-electrolysis becomes industrialised.Another approach not entirely without merit would be to increase the solar flux by using GIANT mirrors.Another proposed idea is to dig a few dozen enormous holes in the crust to let heat out to the surface.Conclusion:VenusVenus is a MUCH harder bet than Mars. While Mars could be terraformed in only a few thousand years, no gently-gently approach could ever work on Venus.First, alternatives to terraforming. It would be possible to live on Venus in the high atmosphere, in giant floating cities. Using a standard space-station atmospheric mix at about half an earth atmosphere, a pressurized geodesic sphere would float naturally somewhere above the bulk of the clouds of sulfuric acid. Atmospheric motions would likely lead to some rotation about the polar areas, where inhabitants would experience a near-perpetual sunset. Floating cities could be mechanically rotated to provide a day-night cycle for on-board agriculture. The Venusian atmosphere is rich in carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and has trace quantities of water. These could be mined for building materials, while rarer elements could be mined from the surface with long scoops or imported from other places with space-plane shuttles.But Venus is nearly as big as Earth, with similar gravity and heaps of sun. Floating cities are all very well, but we need to house billions of humans, not millions. What's the next step?First, the atmosphere has got to go. 200 atmospheres of crushing pressure, heat, and sulfuric acid rain.Energy required for giant mirror to reflect all light from the surface:After a hundred years or so, the atmosphere freezes out onto the surface (briefly going through an interesting super-critical phase). While you wait, you can use it to absorb the impact of a few icy comets and moons, in order to give Venus some badly needed water.We need a way to spin Venus faster. The obvious approach is to crash asteroids into the surface to make it turn faster. Cost of this isIn fact, the mass of the atmosphere, now frozen out hundreds of meters thick all over the planet, is about the same as the mass of the entire asteroid belt, and it's already on Venus. All you have to do is chuck it off the surface fast enough and in the right direction, and you can spin the planet in any direction you like. In order to spin the planet up to a 24 hour day AND get rid of the frozen atmosphere, it needs to leave the surface at aboutAfter this is done, the energy budget can be pilfered to sculpt a few ocean basins and continents, synthesize a desired atmosphere, open the sunshade a little, and start growing plants.Conclusion:Postscript:Slate article comments:Magnetic fields!",0 followers,Hiroyuki Kitagawa,7K,2.5K,4.7M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

This is because D-D fusion reaction rates in MCF fusion devices we know how to build are too low to result in break-even energy with D-D fusion. The situation is different however with Inertial Confinement Fusion. Commercially significant D-D fusion in Inertial Confinement Fusion reactors using pure deuterium fuel separated from sea water is practical but energy conversion in this case is unfortunately somewhat complex, with about 66% of the energy release from D-D fusion being released as energetic neutrons.D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWhile 66% of the energy of D-D fusion is released in fusion neutrons, a significant amount of energy is also released in charged protons and alpha particles.Unlike the charged particles, the uncharged neutrons cannot be confined by a magnetic field, and for this reason cannot be easily used for a direct conversion into electric energy.Some first generation fusion power plant concepts have featured early power conversion designs that primarily use fusion heat to produce electricity and use the larger 80% fraction of fusion energy found in energetic neutrons to breed Tritium in a breeding blanket loaded with Lithium-6.It is possible to propose energy conversion systems for D-D fusion power plants that attempt to capture some of the energy released by D-D fusion fast neutrons and turn that energy into heat. For such a system, the neutrons have to be slowed down in some medium (like molten lithium), heating this medium to a temperature of less than 10^3K. The heat collected in the lithium blanket is then removed from this medium and is used to drive a turbine-generator. This conversion of nuclear into electric energy unfortunately has a Carnot efficiency of about 30%.Using a lithium blanket to capture a portion of the energy in fusion neutrons, which is 80% of the energy released from DT fusion and 66% of the energy released from D-D fusion , the energy conversion efficiency is low - no more than 24% over all. Further, liquid lithium metal is very flammable at temperature likely to exist in operating first generation fusion reactors. Use of hot molten lithium metal as a neutron absorber - coolant could compromise the intrinsic safety of first generation fusion reactors. We should be trying to engineer the safest commercial fusion reactors we know how to design. I believe it would be better to consider using a safer coolant such as molten salts in first generation fusion reactors. Molten salts cannot spontaneously burst into flame when coming into contact with air or water in a large accident while compromising overall fusion reactor safety.While this relatively low 24% conversion efficiency of fusion energy into electrical energy cannot be overcome in magnetic confinement reactors we currently know how to build,ICF fusion power plants (both DT and DD) can be accomplished higher energy conversion efficiency by surrounding the inertial confinement fusion target with a sufficiently thick layer of liquid hydrogen and a thin outer layer of boron, creating a hot plasma fire ball. The hydrogen layer must be chosen just thick and dense enough to be heated by the neutrons to 100,000 degrees K. The so generated, fully ionized, and rapidly expanding hydrogen fire ball can then drive a pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator at an almost 100% Carnot efficiency [1].Electrostatic direct conversion -More advanced fusion reactions like p-B11 and He3-He3 that released a larger proportion of fusion energy as charged particles (protons and alpha particles) can use direct collection of charged particles working against magnetic or electrostatic field or directly collect particles on stationary screens to convert fusion energy charged particles into electrical energy at high efficiency[2].Electrostatic direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage. This voltage drives electricity in a wire. This becomes the electrical power. It is normally thought of in reverse. Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion. Direct conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It has been described as a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He proposed a way to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage, which would drive current in a wire. Dr. Post helped developed the theoretical underpinnings of direct conversion, which was later demonstrated by Dr. William Barr and Dr.Ralph Moir at LLNL. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981. In subsequent decades, the efficiency of converting the energy in charged particles as are produced in advanced fusion reactions into electricity was demonstrated at efficiencies as high as 80%, which is about twice as high an efficiency as the best current thermal power plant turbine generators can demonstrate while converting heat into electricity.[1] -",825 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,15.0,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

So they have to put in a tremendous amount of energy to get these atoms into a fusion chain reaction process. In the case of fusion bombs, they actually initiate the fusion reaction with a fission reaction of uranium or other fissile material. So you get two nuclear reactions for the price of one, a fission one is the primer, and the fusion one is the secondary and larger energy source.

This is the concept of any thermonuclear warhead.If you are asking about sustained nuclear fusion for energy production, we are still unable to produce a controlled fusion reaction for anymore than a fraction of a second. In order to do so, we need to maintain the fusion materials under intense temperatures and pressures. If we were to try to do that using nuclear fission, we would need to produce and contain a sustained fission explosion which, I believe, would be problematic. Current fission reactors use highly controlled reactions which release heat at a slow rate, but I do not believe that process would be helpful in providing the conditions necessary for fusion.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion

(Not all challenges apply to all fusion concepts as there are many different approaches). But actually, solutions to practically all of the issues are either known or well advanced.Really, the single remaining challenge is the behaviour of the plasma under very extreme conditions. Plasmas carry their own electric currents and magnetic fields which interact with those of the containment. High temperatures introduce chaotic instabilities that cause the plasma to twist like a demon. The trick is to make the plasma behave stably for long enough to do useful amounts of fusion. The plasma behaviour is very difficult to observe as the instabilities grow from microscopic scales, and very difficult to simulate with computer models. Neverthless, great strides have been made with numerical simulations.The trouble is, it’s very hard to predict when anyone will crack this final nut. Looking at nuclear fusion from the outside it can seem as if they’ve just been plugging away at the same problem for decades. But this really isn’t the case. Enormous strides are being made each year. Quite a number of commercial fusion startups claim to be within just two to five years of demonstrating breakeven fusion and then scaling up to commercial sizes. (Fusion rates tend to scale exponentially with machine size). Commercial fusion that actually puts electricity on the grid is definitely not earlier than 2030–2040 but we might be able to say that we are on a definite path to success well before that.

While temperature is important, it must be simultaneously achieved together with adequate confinement time and plasma density or little actual fusion occurs.The parameter hardest to achieve in tokamak and stellarator devices we know how to build is actually not plasma temperature but rather plasma density.The graphic below shows that current fusion experiments vary in the density of their fusion plasmas by in excess of ten orders of magnitude - with ICF fusion using the densest plasmas and tokamaks and stellarators using the least dense plasmas.It is advantageous to confine fusion plasma under high pressure, but it is possible to achieve fusion in low ion density plasma also. Fusion experiments on earth employ widely differing plasma densities. There is literally a 10^10 difference in the typical operating plasma density inside a magnetic confinement fusion tokamak experiment (ITER) and a inertial confinement fusion experiment (NIF).Practical production of energy from fusion will require producing net energy while simultaneously achieving a high enough power density to make fusion power plants commercially competitive with alternative fission and fossil fuel power plants. The power that can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the square of the density of the fusion plasma. The denser the plasma, the more energy that can be extracted from it.It is easier to produce fusion reactors that exhibit high energy density if they employ dense plasma at fusion conditions.Fusion experiments vary greatly in the density of their fusion plasmas. There is over 10^10 (ten orders of magnitude) difference between current tokamak - stellerator plasma density and ICF laser or particle beam fusion plasma density.Can we achieve high Power density (referring to the rate of energy production per unit of reactor volume) from magnetic confinement devices like thye ITER tokamak or a Weldenstein stellarator?Tokamak and Stellarator Fusion will almost certainly have a lower power density than fission and therefore will require a larger plant to produce the same energy output.It is perhaps not unreasonable to suppose a fusion plant based on magnetic confinement ITER/DEMO technology might have to be ten times as big and therefore something close to ten times as costly — as a present-day fission nuclear plant to produce the same amount of power.Given the already intolerable costs of building fission plants, it would seem that machines that use very low density plasma like tokamaks and stellerators do not stand much of a chance to achieve high energy density and that would make them economically viable as a commercial technology and a secure technical basis for future commercial fusion power plants.Before scientists can effectively capture and deploy fusion energy, they must learn to predict major disruptions that can halt fusion reactions and damage the walls of doughnut-shaped tokamak fusion devices. Timely prediction of disruptions, the sudden loss of control of the hot, charged plasma that fuels the reactions, will be vital to triggering steps to avoid or mitigate such large-scale events. Fusion researchers at ITER and JET tokamaks currently attempt to use high speed real time computing to predict plasma disruptions that might be dangerous and halt power generation. A combination of plasma related high speed sensor data aquisition coupled to a predictive artificial intelligence code running on a local computer is major area of technical development that it is hoped will improve the chance that tokamaks can be adjusted to run stably for extended periods of time.The issue of producing net energy while simultaneously achieving a high enough power plant power density are a dominant theme for the near future selection of which fusion technology is best suited to produce competitive fusion power plants.Technical note1:Technical note2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vastamount of energy in uncontrolled manner isreleased causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclearfusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion

Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for small fusion reactor applications.

Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).The energy required from a fusion driver to successfully ignite small sub-gram DT ICF fusion capsules has been experimentally shown[1] to be about 50 MJ delivered to a 2mm spot in less than 3 nanoseconds. 50 MJ is the amount of energy released when burning 6 cups of automotive gasoline.

All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777.1K,17.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-build-a-small-functional-fusion-reactor

China may be building one currently. India is also developing Thorium reactors. Thorium being potentially a far better fuel than Uranium. MSR problems include testing of materials and equipment, assessing long term operation and management of the MSR fuel mix with chemical management of nuclear materials produced. Of line removal of useful products and reactor poisons that reduce available neutrons.I think we urgently need more low carbon energy and Thorium could produce results faster than anything else. And more complex and difficult reactor types Should be produced in future. That requires rapid production of MSR prototypes. Thorium being highly efficient readily available and cheap. Able to power the Earth for hundreds of years. While better reactors are produced.Fast Breeder reactors including molten metal and gas coolant. Past development of these reactor types has been difficult. Especially molten metals including Sodium. Sodium is highly flammable when in contact with oxygen. The advantages of fast breeder reactors are that they can convert waste material into fissile material. Especially turning depleted Uranium into fuel grade material by colliding fast neutrons with depleted Uranium nuclei. Gas breeders include helium coolants. Major [problem may be a lack of Helium available.Molten Salt and Fusion Reactors. Molten Salt may be a coolant for fusion reactors and also absorption of excess neutrons that can badly damage reactor materials. The molten salt could also be used to carry fissile material that could be fissioned by the neutrons. This can release energy or could be used to burn up nuclear waste. Or fast neutrons can create fissile material from depleted Uranium.If we could easily produce neutrons we could build a subcritical reactor. A reactor that could be turned of by stopping the Neutrons. It means it could be turned off instantly without risks of meltdown. Also for burning up nuclear waste. A powerful supply of neutrons could be from a fusion reactor.\\ITER FUSION REACTORFUSION REACTORA number of conventional donut type tokamak reactors are operating as prototypes but none are functional. Some of these Tokamak type reactors have produced longer running times. Recently a German reactor worked for 100 seconds.More unconventional fusion reactors are being developed. This includes a small Lockheed Martin reactor. It is said to be very close to being operational. Small being that it could be towed by a large truck. A couple of designs could be much smaller. A very large design could combine very large pistons to compress molten mercury with fusible material. The large scale version is very impressive. Another reactor produces plasma that is concentrated enough to fuse atoms.Molten salt fission reactors are potential highly efficient and able to burn up all the fuel and its fissile products. Using Thorium no enrichment is needed. Thorium is a buy product of rare Earth mining so could be extremely cheap. Currently it is mostly regarded as waste. Despite very, very low radiation much of it is regarded as nuclear material which is difficult to dispose.One joint project between China and the US is a fission travelling wave reactor. This travelling wave in some ways seems like a nuclear candle but that is not a scientific description. This reactor is a very safe and simple reactor using depleted Uranium as fuel. Depleted Uranium is available in huge amounts and regarded as nuclear waste. It is the waste produced when the very small amounts of useful fuel grade Uranium is separated by expensive enrichment. When mined less than 10% of Uranium is fuel grade. So over 95% becomes the depleted Uranium. The main use of depleted Uranium is military, for armour or armour piercing material. As in the M1 Abrams. This reactor type can also use molten salt to cool and transfer heat. But not carry the fuel. It is almost completely self regulating. It can be transported easily. In effect acting like a nuclear battery. This is a project of Bill Gates who wants safe, cheap and easy to run reactor that could be used in Africa where no nuclear industry is available. It would not need complex chemical management of the coolant containing fuel as in an MSR.I think MSR prototypes sho7uld be produces rapidly to prove MSR is closer to being completed and has less risks. But huge amounts of money is going into fusion and breeder reactors. I would like to some diverted to produce MSR prototypes.The international ITER project is not complete. But its huge size and use of advanced and expensive materials make it potentially much more efficient and powerful. More powerful than any other fusion reactor. It uses huge and powerful superconducting magnets to pressurise the fuel. Potentially 8 times more pressure and heat.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,19.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-build-a-small-functional-fusion-reactor

I wont go into too much details about it as there is plenty of information about this reactor here on quora.The are also concepts of using nuclear energy to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order to store energy in a form of petrol or jet fuel.

With such a rapid increase in worldwide energy use, there is certainly room for fusion technology investors to profit, Frequently omitted from discussion is the fact that there is currently in existence a practical working fusion technology that reliably produces more fusion energy out than the electrical energy the fusion experiment consumes.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Ivy-Mike achieved an engineering fusion energy gain factor Qe>100,000 (one hundred thousand times more fusion energy produced than the electrical energy required to trigger the fission-fusion device).All of the small fusion nuclear startups that are today actively designing and building fusion prototypes are long-shots (high risk - high reward) gambles. Fusion experiments are currently free of regulatory hindrance and obstruction, and the potential for rapid extreme profits for investors does exit if viable economical approaches to fusion can be identified.Modern fission-fusion is still the most reliable and proven way to produce fusion energy with energy gain. Pure fusion variations of the technology exist as paper designs (but do not yet exit as physically constructed, field tested products). Senior nuclear designers like LLNL’s Dr. Ralph Moir believe that fission-fusion technology has matured to the point that practical fission-fusion devices that produce 99% of their energy yield from fusion (and less than 1% of their energy yield from fission) are now possible.Many people today seem to believe that since existing tokamaks experiments like ITER are receiving the majority of worldwide fusion funding, they must be the best hope for ultimately producing commercial fusion. This is a questionable hypothesis at best, as ITER is already scaled to an impractically large size to compete head to head with existing fossil fuel and fission nuclear plants and tokamaks would in actuality have to be scaled many times larger than ITER for an actual commercial fusion reactor. MCF fusion today is consuming most of the world’s fusion R&D funding but just scaling this technology to larger and LARGER size to improve fusion gain factor and performance is unlikely to ultimately result in a competitive, reliable, commercial fusion power plants. No MCF device (tokamak or stellarator) in the last 60 years has ever, even for micro-seconds, produced more energy from fusion than it must draw as electrical power from the local power grid to make the magnetic fusion device operate. The claim that MCF tokamaks and stellarators should be considered fusion technology “front runners” is not really justified by six decades of actual experimental achievement with MCF technology.Given ITER and follow on DEMO tokamak Magnetic Confinement fusion technology, A MCF fusion reactor might well produce only one tenth as much power as a fission reactor of the same size.But merely producing a net positive power output is not enough; achieving a high enough power density is also crucial. Power density refers to the rate of energy production per unit of reactor volume. Fusion will almost certainly have a lower power density than fission and therefore will require a larger plant to produce the same output. Suppose a fusion plant had to be ten times as big and therefore likely ten times as costly — as a present-day fission plant to produce the same amount of power. Given the already intolerable costs of building fission power plants, that would hardly be economically feasible. These issues of producing net energy and achieving a high enough power density to achieve commercial competitiveness are dominant themes of the current fusion quest.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-investors-putting-millions-into-fusion-startups-when-economic-fusion-more-energy-out-than-energy-in-has-never-worked

Any abnormal behavior in the high-temperature plasma will inevitably cause rapid cooling of the plasma and quick termination of fusion process. Due to low fusion fuel inventory and requirement for stable confinement, there is no possibility of an uncontrolled large-scale fusion energy release. Moreover, the reaction products themselves are not radioactive (in contrast to fission).The above graph is a compoarison of fission and fusion in terms of radioactivity remaining in years following reactor shutdown (note log scale on Y axis that compresses visually the differences between fission and fusion in terms of production of radioactive waste and their endurance in the environment).The fusion neutrons induce radioactivity in the surrounding structure and tritium is a radioactive isotope. The amount and hazard of the resulting radioactivity strongly depends on the choice of material surrounding the fusion chamber. Proper choice of materials can result in minimization of activation products and tritium inventories[1].The radiological inventory in a fusion power plant can be much lower than that in an equivalent power fission reactor, and the time-integrated biological hazard potential can be lower byThe use of low-activation materials will also allow fusion components to be recycled or disposed of as low-level waste and not be a burden to future generations. The comparison of the decay of the radioactive inventory in a reference fission reactor and reference fusion power plants using low-activation wall materials is shown in the graph above. The graph shows the potential advantage of fusion power. After a period of 100 years, the radioactivity remaining from a fusion system can be millions of times less than that from fission. In the simplest terms, this translates into no need for the storage of waste over the geological time periods contemplated for repositories such as Yucca Mountain. In fact, the dose rates are small enough that some components can be directly recycled.Futher improvements that result in still yet cleaner forms of nuclear fusion can be expected to result from future innovations like -Falling Wall Molten Salt fusion chambers[2]Advanced fusion fuel cycles including He3-He3 anutronic fusion.He3 + He3 -> He4 + 2protons + 12.9 MeVHe3-He3 fusion uses totally non-radioactive fuel and produces totally non-radioative Helium as nuclear waste (and no neutrons - only easily shieldable protons that can be collected and directly produce electricity at very high efficiency exceeding the Carnot efficiency of any current thermal power plant)The combined requirements of He3-He3 ICF fusion is believed to be only about 40X the combined temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time requirements of DT fusion.

There will be experimental modules that use these neutrons to breed Tritium, to develop the breeder blanket technology to be used in future reactors such as DEMO and PROTO. These modules will need to use “neutron multipliers” to breed more than one atom of Tritium per neutron, as one atom of Tritium is consumed in producing each neutron and the goal in future reactors is to replace the Tritium as fast as it is consumed, and there will be some neutron losses (in irradiating the PFM for example). This neutron multiplier will produce still more nuclear waste.So there will be lots of nuclear waste, and as a result the earth will become a slightly more radioactive place.And unlike the extra radioactivity produced by fission reactors, this increase will never disappear completely.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Dr. Seifritz called his version of thermonuclear reactor HACER, a name perhaps intended to point out and emphasize the fact that his thermonuclear power plant included fusion production of hydrogen for transportation use as well as fusion produced electricity. Hydrogen production was a new feature for HACER and differentiated that power plant design from LANL and LLNL PACER fusion.Above is an artist's conception of a PACER fusion ""energy park ""which shows a large combustion cavern about 1 mile deep and 200 meters in diameter. A deuterium- deuterium fuel charge would be exploded here in the range of a 1 to 20 kiloton TNT yield. The cavity, filled with superheated steam, would absorb and quench the fusion fireball and act as a transport medium to carry thermal energy and by-products.Hacer: A Grand Design for Fusion Powerhttp://wlym.com/archive/fusion/fusion/19801111-fusion.pdfIn the 1950s, after development of the H-bomb, U.S. researchers at LANL and LLNL national laboratories developed a project known as Pacer, aimed at peaceful applications of nuclear explosions. The H- bomb, of course, is typically portrayed as ""uncontrolled"" release of fusion energy using a relatively small fission (A-bomb) trigger. What the Pacer project envisioned was the regular deto­nation of very small fusion bursts optimized for ultra-clean cost effective power generation in carefully designed, steam-filled caverns one mile underground, producing enormous amounts of electricity and, if desired, fissile material for startup of exceptionally clean operating fission reactors like Thorium Molten Salt Reactors or LFTRs.Most appealing about this approach presented by Dr. Seifritz is that there are only minor scientific and technical obstacles to the reali­zation of a Pacer-like power generating systems for harnessing fission-fusion and with only a few additional years of development, pure fusion energy. PACRER fission-fusion power plants could be undertaken immediately, on the basis of field proven existing technology and know-how, guaranteeing com­mercial fusion power within five years in a time frame that matters for solving worldwide climate and energy scarcity problemsWhy were PACER power plants, which would actually been 100X cleaner in terms of production of Minor Actinides and fission product high level nuclear waste, canceled by the Nixon Administration?President Nixon had made campaign promises to the American people to rein in federal spending, and the Nixon Administration searched for ways to trim spending. Leading edge nuclear fusion research, unfortunately, came to the attention of Nixon Administration budget managers and several visionary nuclear technologies then under development including Molten Salt Fission Reactors and PACER fusion were cut as President Nixon tried to keep his promise to the American people in reining in federal spending.In addition, environmental and ""nonproliferation"" arguments were put forward in Congress intending to force discontinuation of the Pacer projects at LANL and LLNL. These arguments, however, lacked technical validity.The underground mounted PACER reactor could be located far away from any community, operate very safely in a conservatively designed underground PACER cavern, and pose no nuclear haz­ards to populated areas of the globe while safely and sustainably producing ultra-clean DD fusion power used to produce commercial electricity.Dr. Ralph Moir led LLL efforts into producing PACER reactors in the mid-1970s.Modern versions of PACER would probably use pure fusion technology.A pure fusion peaceful nuclear explosive (PNE) optimized for ultra-clean power generation is a nuclear device design that does not need a fission ""primary"" to ignite fusion in a secondary stage but rather employs a pure fusion deuterium-tritium primary to ignite a pure deuterium power generating second stage.Pure fusion ICF devices produce small controlled bursts of fusion energy inside of 100 meter deep underground mounted evacuated mini-PACER cavity. When such a small fusion device is initiated inside its stainless steel cylindrical chamber, no shock and no sound is transmitted to the ground above.Vacuum will not permit transmission of sound.Vacuum will not permit transmission of shock.The mini-PACER device produces the Tritium it needs for the DT primary from Tritium produced via the D-D fusion reaction on the preceding shot. Tritium (190 milligrams) need only be supplied from an external source one time on the very first shot. All shots made in the mini-PACER reactor thereafter can be provided from Tritium bred in the reactor from residual Tritium scavenged from the fusion chamber debris left by previous D-D fusion shots. Thus Tritium supply is cheap and sustainable with the modern pure fusion form of PACER ICF; the vast majority of fusion energy produced by the mini-PACER reactor each shot is from cheap and ubiquitous Deuterium fuel separated from sea water.National governments have tended to respond with unreasonable fear to fusion reactor designs that produce power in short controlled fusion bursts. Much less technically mature and more difficult tokamak and stellarator reactors have for decades received funding preferentially over practical demonstrated ICF fusion approaches because they promised smooth power generation from extended continuous fusion burns as opposed to a series of many short, controlled fusion bursts. The reality is that tokamaks and stellarator fusion devices have not in 60 years attained burns producing any significant amount of power for more than a few seconds before the plasma confinement is lost and the fusion reaction stops.Reliable, repeatable, small controlled fusion bursts inside an evacuated chamber designed to safely contain all the radiation generated by fusion reactions is just as safe as the safest magnetic confinement continuous burn experiment. In all cases, the fusion reactions used are the same. Nuclear waste generated are in all cases also the same. Tiny mini-Mike fusion devices are harmless if stolen as they require large stationary lasers or ion beam particle accelerators to ignite them.Underground ICF pure fusion power generation is just as safe as the safest form of fusion that anyone has so far proposed and is a lot more rapidly implementable.Note 1: DOE during the cold war had a well funded and well led program to develop pure fusion experimental devices.(It 	may now be revealed)DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)(Point 3 may be disputed -Note 2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vast amounts of energy in uncontrolled manner is released causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclear fusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.The truth is that during the 1950s, fusion program managers wanting to develop fusion reactors like tokamaks and stellarators sought to dissociate themselves and their fusion technology (good) from thermonuclear fusion weapons technology (bad) which the public feared. The notion of controlled versus uncontrolled fusion was largely public relations and spin employed by AEC fusion program managers to enlist wider public support.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-investors-putting-millions-into-fusion-startups-when-economic-fusion-more-energy-out-than-energy-in-has-never-worked

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",55 followers,Jeff Suzuki,1.3K,4.4K,7.2M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-investors-putting-millions-into-fusion-startups-when-economic-fusion-more-energy-out-than-energy-in-has-never-worked

That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

1,"Because the pressures and temperatures required for fusion are extremely difficult to produce. As a material heats up, it wants to expand, this stops fusion from happening. The center of a star has trillions of tonnes of mass squeezing it together, so it’s easily able to maintain the required conditions. A fusion reactor has to use other means to keep the reaction mass together (inertial or magnetic confinement), which is not easy to do.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",45 followers,Brad Gunn,3.4K,1.5K,1.5M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees.

13,"Inertial Confinement D-D fusion isMankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike fission-fusion nuclear test that produced huge amounts of fusion energy from pure DeuInertial Confinement D-D fusion isMankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike fission-fusion nuclear test that produced huge amounts of fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away).Historically, this early method of producing more energy from nuclear fusion than it took to bring the fusion device to fusion conditions actually worked the very first time it was tried experimentally (Ivy -Mike nuclear test 1952) -ICF D-D fission-fusion technology historicallyand produced large industrially significant amounts of fusion energy in excess of the energy required to run the experiment from the very first experimental test.Today, pure fusion device technology derived from successful early fission-fusion designs that does not require a fission primary is possible and is a better candidate for peaceful, ultra-clean, commercial electrical energy production from fusion.How might a multi-stage ICF pure fusion device work?A laser irradiates a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere, which initiates D-T fusion ignition which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a slightly tapered cylindrical pressurized liquid deuterium-filled tube.The energy yield of such a multi-stage pure fusion device can be “tuned” for convenient yield over a wide range by increasing (or decreasing) the length of the liquid Deuterium filled cylinder.As compared to DT fusion, pure deuterium fusion has the advantage that a larger fraction of its energy is released in form of charged fusion products. In the DT reaction 80% of the energy released goes into fast neutrons, whereas in the DD reaction the fraction is only 34%. DD fusion therefore permits the transfor­mation of a larger portion of the energy released directly into electric energy by magnetohydrodynamic power conversion. Moreover, in case of DD fusion, the neutron energy is only 2.4 MeV, whereas in DT fusion it is 14 MeV. The much larger neutron energy in DT fusion increases the material problems resulting from neutron bombardment of structural parts in a DT fusion reactor.A multi-stage DT-DD pure fusion device would use the minimum amount of Tritium to get fusion started in the pure fusion primary while allowing the smallest feasible laser to be used to initiate fusion by using Tritium in the fusion primary which has the characteristic of reaching ignition at the least demanding combination of conditions (temperature, confinement time, and plasma pressure).Could nuclear fusion be sustainable?Deuterium fusion and its ultimate potential for worldwide sustainable energy generation -D-D Fusion Can Provide Clean Sustainable Power Longer than the Earth has Existed or the Sun will BurnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium.The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy.In the year 2018 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts of energy as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn)Nuclear fusion may not be considered by some as being renewable, as it depends on the fusion of Deuterium taken from the world's oceans which while very abundant, is limited. Fusion energy should however produce reliable, dispatchable power on demand longer than renewable wind and solar.The very earliest successful energy producing fusion reactors will probably use the first generation fusion reactions (DT and DD fusion). Over time, technical advance will allow second and third generation fusion fuels to be utilized for commercial power generation and powering transportation applications (ships, cars, planes, and even power tools) over the course of the next 200 years.The ultimate potential of D-D fusion is very very great.The original proposal for fusion in the earliest days of the fusion program (late 1940s and 1950s) was to produce power through the self-fusion of deuterium — the D-D reaction. This reaction produces with equal probability, either the light helium isotope with two protons and a neutron (He3) or the heaviest hydrogen isotope, tritium (T) with one proton and tow neutrons. Both reactions release energy, generally measured in millions of electron volts (MeV).D + D —> He3 + n + 3.2 MeVD + D —> T + p + 4.0 MeVThese reaction products can themselves react with deuterium and will either be “burned” in place or recycled.D + T —> He4 + n + 17.6 MeVD + He3 —> He4 + p + 18.3 MeVBecause the fuel for the last two reactions is generated in the ﬁrst two, only deuterium need be supplied externally. The ﬁnal reaction products — ordinary helium and hydrogen — are benign, but the energetic neutrons can damage and induce radioactivity in the structure of the reactor. This neutron activation of reactor structure is a manageable problem that nuclear engineers can reduce and minimize by using low neutron activation steels and materials in the fusion chamber. Further improvement in solving neutron damage and fusion chamber neutron activation problems can be obtained by employing a neutronically thick falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorbent that absorbs fusion neutrons before they damage reactor structure and also safely carries away heat from the fusion reaction.Additional practical considerationsThere are reasons to believe that ICF laser fusion power plants will be stable and reliable sources of power right from the first days of operation while early complex MCF fusion power plants will struggle to produce reliable power and will actually produce energy for early decades in short, unpredictable, bursts of under a minute or so before the plasma goes unstable and the MCF power plant has to be shut down.It is considerably easier to create and then sustain fusion conditions for sub-gram samples of fusion fuel for a few nanoseconds in laser Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment than it is to stably maintain intense precise magnetic fields forming a stable plasma bottle or trap for indefinite amounts of time in Magnetic Confinement Fusion tokamak and stellarator devices.While MCF fusion devices are frequently described and marketed to the public as nice stable continuous fusion plasma burning energy producing devices, the truth is that such stable energy production has never yet been achieved even once for more than a second or two at significant power levels in more than sixty years of hard research effort The current record for MCF pure fusion power generation was demonstrated using the JET tokamak in 1997 while burning DT fuel where JET produced something close to beak-even power for a bit less than a second - producing about three quarters the fusion energy as output as the electrical energy that was drawn from the local power grid to bring fusion plasma to fusion conditions. The facts are that to date all MCF fusion experiments have produced short irregular and unpredictable amounts of power in short unpredictable spits and spurts - usually of less than a second length before the plasma goes unstable and the run in the experimental MCF fusion device must be shut down.It is considerably easier to do something hard like creating and then sustaining fusion conditions in DT or DD fusion plasma for nanoseconds than it is to continuously maintain fusion conditions in MCF fusion devices continuously and indefinitely.As a result, small ICF based fusion power plants will tend to be safe, stable, and reliable power generators right from the beginning once they are commercially introduced while complex, large Magnetic Confinement Fusion devices like tokamaks and stellarators will struggle to produce fusion energy in irregular, unpredictable spurts of power for at least the first couple of decades of operation of first generation MCF fusion power plants.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,508,6.8K,91.4M,13.0,https://www.quora.com/How-will-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-look-like

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,14.0,https://www.quora.com/How-will-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-look-like

And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Tokamaks, including the smaller spherical tokamaks by Tokamak energy, are sold to the public as continuous power generators while in fact only produce power in spurts of less than a couple of hundreds seconds at a time. This is because a transformer in the power supply is used to produce the huge currents in the plasma required to reach and then maintain fusion conditions This fact is not adequately explained by tokamak advocates (and these facts are typically not passed along by fusion professionals to the public leaving large portions of the public misinformed - believing that tokamak reactors produce smooth continuous power when this is far from being the case).Hundreds of Tokamaks, Stellarators, and other magnetic fusion designs have been built over the last 60 years and hundreds of thousands of shots have been made with these machines without a single instance of net power being demonstrated.Inertial Confinement Fusion is frequently criticized with public support withheld because ICF produces energy in a series of short controlled fusion bursts. People like smooth power, not short repeated bursts of power. This preference for magentic confinement fusion projects among decision makers and the public is based however on misinformation that for decades has been carefully passed as misinformation. Tokamaks, including the ITER tokamak and the ST 40 by Tokamak Energy, do not produce continuous power but rather produce somewhat irregular releases of power no longer than a few hundred seconds in duration at a time due to limitations in the Tokamak power supply that require use of high current transformers to produce the huge currents required in tokamak plasma current.Note: The record for tokamak fusion power generation is about 5 seconds while producing significant amounts of power (JET tokamak - 1996).Fission ignited Inertial Confinement Fusion worked the very first time it was tried (Ivy-Mike test) demonstrating fusion power generation with energy gain (fusion gain factor Qe=>100,000) and has never since failed to work.I think that if the object is to introduce a practical form of fusion in the least amount of time (10 years or less to commercial versions) - then it is better to adapt fission-fusion technology that worked the first time it was tried (and never failed) to be pure fusion rather than continue to try to improve magnetic confinement fusion devices that have never worked and never once produced net energy even once in sixty long years of devoted efforts.Fission-fusion is not unicorns, science fiction, or BS.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away).Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). In the final few years on underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays generated in the primary of an experimental fission device.During the last decade of the cold war, ICF fusion was experimentally PROVEN to work by both LANL and LLNL field test divisions. If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is NO QUESTION that full pure fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved.NY Times article published at the time of the once classified Halite-Centurion field tests -","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,22.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor

The H- bomb, of course, is typically portrayed as ""uncontrolled"" release of fusion energy using a relatively small fission (A-bomb) trigger. What the Pacer project envisioned was the regular deto­nation of very small fusion bursts optimized for ultra-clean cost effective power generation in carefully designed, steam-filled caverns one mile underground, producing enormous amounts of electricity and, if desired, fissile material for startup of exceptionally clean operating fission reactors like Thorium Molten Salt Reactors or LFTRs.Most appealing about this approach presented by Dr. Seifritz is that there are only minor scientific and technical obstacles to the reali­zation of a Pacer-like power generating systems for harnessing fission-fusion and with only a few additional years of development, pure fusion energy.

These arguments, however, lacked technical validity.The underground mounted PACER reactor could be located far away from any community, operate very safely in a conservatively designed underground PACER cavern, and pose no nuclear haz­ards to populated areas of the globe while safely and sustainably producing ultra-clean DD fusion power used to produce commercial electricity.Dr. Ralph Moir led LLL efforts into producing PACER reactors in the mid-1970s.Modern versions of PACER would probably use pure fusion technology.A pure fusion peaceful nuclear explosive (PNE) optimized for ultra-clean power generation is a nuclear device design that does not need a fission ""primary"" to ignite fusion in a secondary stage but rather employs a pure fusion deuterium-tritium primary to ignite a pure deuterium power generating second stage.Pure fusion ICF devices produce small controlled bursts of fusion energy inside of 100 meter deep underground mounted evacuated mini-PACER cavity. When such a small fusion device is initiated inside its stainless steel cylindrical chamber, no shock and no sound is transmitted to the ground above.Vacuum will not permit transmission of sound.Vacuum will not permit transmission of shock.The mini-PACER device produces the Tritium it needs for the DT primary from Tritium produced via the D-D fusion reaction on the preceding shot. Tritium (190 milligrams) need only be supplied from an external source one time on the very first shot. All shots made in the mini-PACER reactor thereafter can be provided from Tritium bred in the reactor from residual Tritium scavenged from the fusion chamber debris left by previous D-D fusion shots. Thus Tritium supply is cheap and sustainable with the modern pure fusion form of PACER ICF; the vast majority of fusion energy produced by the mini-PACER reactor each shot is from cheap and ubiquitous Deuterium fuel separated from sea water.National governments have tended to respond with unreasonable fear to fusion reactor designs that produce power in short controlled fusion bursts. Much less technically mature and more difficult tokamak and stellarator reactors have for decades received funding preferentially over practical demonstrated ICF fusion approaches because they promised smooth power generation from extended continuous fusion burns as opposed to a series of many short, controlled fusion bursts. The reality is that tokamaks and stellarator fusion devices have not in 60 years attained burns producing any significant amount of power for more than a few seconds before the plasma confinement is lost and the fusion reaction stops.Reliable, repeatable, small controlled fusion bursts inside an evacuated chamber designed to safely contain all the radiation generated by fusion reactions is just as safe as the safest magnetic confinement continuous burn experiment. In all cases, the fusion reactions used are the same. Nuclear waste generated are in all cases also the same. Tiny mini-Mike fusion devices are harmless if stolen as they require large stationary lasers or ion beam particle accelerators to ignite them.Underground ICF pure fusion power generation is just as safe as the safest form of fusion that anyone has so far proposed and is a lot more rapidly implementable.Note 1: DOE during the cold war had a well funded and well led program to develop pure fusion experimental devices.(It 	may now be revealed)DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)(Point 3 may be disputed -Note 2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vast amounts of energy in uncontrolled manner is released causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclear fusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.The truth is that during the 1950s, fusion program managers wanting to develop fusion reactors like tokamaks and stellarators sought to dissociate themselves and their fusion technology (good) from thermonuclear fusion weapons technology (bad) which the public feared. The notion of controlled versus uncontrolled fusion was largely public relations and spin employed by AEC fusion program managers to enlist wider public support.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.",829 followers,Robert Gauthier,738,10.6K,3M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-detonate-thermonuclear-devices-in-large-deep-bodies-of-water-to-heat-the-water-then-extract-energy-from-the-heated-water-to-generate-electricity

These generate about 82 trillion joules per kilogram.Here’s what Wikipedia says about abundance of Uranium and Thorium.Naturally occurring uranium is composed of three major isotopes, uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.7198–0.7202%), and uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%).Thorium [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium ] is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil ]. Soil commonly contains an average of around 6 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several minerals [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral ] including thorite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorite ] (ThSiO4), thorianite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorianite ] (ThO2 + UO2) and monazite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monazite ]. Thorianite is a rare mineral and may contain up to about 12% thorium oxide. Monazite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monazite ] contains 2.5% thorium, allanite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allanite ] has 0.1 to 2% thorium and zircon [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zircon ] can have up to 0.4% thorium. Thorium-containing minerals occur on all continents. Thorium is several times more abundant in Earth's crust than all isotopes of uranium [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_uranium ] combined and thorium-232 is several hundred times more abundant than uranium-235.Thorium concentrations near the surface of the earth can be mapped using gamma spectroscopy [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_spectroscopy ]. The same technique has been used to detect concentrations on the surface of the Moon; the near side [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon ] has high abundances of relatively thorium-rich KREEP [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KREEP ], while the Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton%E2%80%93Belkovich_Thorium_Anomaly ] was detected on the far side [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon ]. Martian [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars ] thorium has also been mapped by 2001 Mars Odyssey [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Mars_Odyssey ].Th232 decays very slowly (its half-life [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life ] is comparable to the age of the universe) but other thorium isotopes [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope ] occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains.

Well, we don’t know how, without first heating a furnace up to about 100,000,000°C.

Well… it is, but it’s not pretty. Modern large-yield nuclear weapons in the megaton range, are actually fusion bombs (as opposed to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima & Nagasaki in WW2, which were fission reaction bombs). Fusion bombs actually have fission “atomic bombs” wrapped around them, and use that nuclear explosion to create the 100 million degree heat required to get the fusion bomb ignited.There are a lot of ongoing experiments, in a lot of different countries, to attempt to make a working fusion reactor which would not require insane amounts of energy to heat up enough to start the fusion reaction, or to develop a process of “cold fusion”, but as of the current day, we do not know of a way to make such a device.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-make-fusion-an-economic-way-to-generate-electricity

Now IF we were able to extract most of that energy AND channel all of it into propulsive energy to accelerate the ship, AND if we stored a huge amount of both D and T in propellant tanks, it still would not get us anywhere close to relativistic speeds. This also presumes that a way will be found to extract the neutron’s energy, which is 80% of the total —- being neutral, it can’t be focused like the He can, thus channeling the neutron’s 14.1 MeV will be a difficult technical challenge. So let’s say your objective is to get to 10% of c (speed of light), meaning a 100 light-year journey to a distant star would take “only” one thousand years, then you’d have to convert mass equal to 0.5% of the ship’s total mass (including fuel) to propulsive energy. If HALF of that mass was D-T fuel, and your energy conversion-propulsion systems were 100% efficient, you’d only be converting 0.5*17.6/4693 = 0.19% of your mass to energy, far short of 0.5%. 0.19% would get the ship to 6.2% of c, a respectable speed BUT that assumes perfect efficiency. Dropping to an overall systems-wide realistic efficiency of 50%, the terminal velocity drops to 4.4% of c (but that’s 8200 miles/second!). However, there would probably be additional propulsive methods employed, such as using giant space-based lasers or solar mirrors to focus onto an ablative rear member that would literally push the ship forward with radiation pressure until it’s out of range, and solar sails that accomplish the same thing, but at a much lower level for a longer period of time.

The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power for billions (yes, with a B) of years, well beyond when the Sun runs out of hydrogen.On the other hand all of these projects are very far from being useful. See, producing more energy in plasma than what you put in via magnets is an important milestone, but the one you should be looking at is not the energy of plasma, it’s the energy you can harvest from that plasma. It’s mostly thermal energy and the conversion factor of that to electric power is usually around 1/2. So even these reactors won’t actually be producing more electric power than what they need to power them. They’d have to produce approximately twice that much just to break even.But wait, breaking even still only means you’re running the reactor without external input. You aren’t putting any energy in the grid yet at this point, all you’re doing is producing small quantities of helium. For the reactor to become commercially viable, it needs to produce energy far in excess of that and you need to account for energy needed to generate adequate deuterium and possibly tritium to run the core.That’s why even the furthest advanced fusion reactors are still very far removed from being useful as a power source. It is hoped that once we manage to produce a reactor that will put more energy out than it needed to run it, smaller incremental improvements will follow quickly and the next two steps will not need an exorbiant amount of time. Math seems to suggest we’ll be able to extract several times the energy we put in, that’s why these projects are being financed in the first place.But don’t count on fusion power plant construction starting in mid-2030s either.

It looks a bit like matter is being converted into energy, but it’s actually energy before and after, with the difference in energy being detectable as a difference in mass.The problem is that the reaction, the stuff doing the reacting, is about as hot as the middle of the Sun. That means you can’t contain it, i.e. hold it together and keep it from leaking out, by enclosing it in steel or ceramics or anything - it would melt its way through anything, and the reactor would quickly be a pile of slag.The Sun holds itself together with gravity. It’s so dang huge that the gas just bunches together and stays that way. Needless to say, we can’t build a reactor the size of the Sun to work that way.Instead, though it’s awkward and difficult, we can contain the explosion with lasers and powerful magnetic fields. Carefully tuned, the combination works a bit like the invisible force fields you sometimes see (or actually don’t see) in Sci-Fi movies.Problem solved! Sorta. Those magnetic fields and lasers cost enormous amounts of energy to set up and maintain. So until recently, most of the energy generated by fusion reactors went into keeping them from blowing up. Nuclear engineering is slowly getting better at setting up that field, and we’re around the point where there’s more energy -barely- being produced than what’s used to hold the reactor together.This sounds wasteful - if (say) 99% of the reactor’s energy output is used up just holding it together, it’s just 1% efficient, right? Well actually, it’s not quite that bad. Hydrogen is incredibly abundant, you can get it from water and you only need a tiny amount. Even the special isotopes of hydrogen needed for a reactor are relatively cheap to obtain.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/They-say-that-fusion-reactors-can-make-more-energy-than-it-uses-But-I-thought-it-was-impossible-in-physics-to-get-more-energy-out-of-less-energy-How-is-it-possible

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor.

UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,18.0,https://www.quora.com/They-say-that-fusion-reactors-can-make-more-energy-than-it-uses-But-I-thought-it-was-impossible-in-physics-to-get-more-energy-out-of-less-energy-How-is-it-possible

But scientists haven’t achieved a net gain of energy.Fusion reactors generally use hydrogen isotopes such as deuterium and tritium, which react more easily and create a confined plasma of millions of degrees using lasers or magnetic methods. The major challenges in realising fusion power are to engineer a system that can confine the plasma long enough at high enough temperature. For that scientists keep the plasma in a very high magnetic field such that plasma begins to float inside the chamber, without touching its surface.Then water tubes on the outer surface of chamber absorb the heat and gets energised this water is then ejected on a turbine to create electricity.I hope my answer helped you.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled

This was a real contest at the time, and both technologies were tried and each had some commercial success. At the time, some early auto customers might have been skeptical that a vehicle powered by thousands of small explosions inside the confined volume of an engine block would be safe and there was doubt that an engine based on producing thousands of carefully timed explosions would be reliable and hang together and be practical in the long run. Over time, the public came to feel that internal combustion engines, even though they depend on thousands of small explosions, can still be practical and safe, and the Stanley Steamer, and other model continuous burning steam powered vehicles, were abandoned as not as efficient.In the next couple of decades we may see a revisiting of the debate over smooth burning Diffuse Plasma Magnetic Confinement Fusion versus Inertial Confinement Fusion featuring a succession small controlled fusion bursts of between 100 - 250 GJ per shot. It is a harder job to keep reliable containment of a plasma at fusion conditions on a magnetic confinement device like a large tokamak that does a continuous plasma burn - the containment tends to fail and the reactor has to periodically be restarted. ICF fusion has already been demonstrated to reliably produce energy on demand (in fission ignited fusion - first-time every-time).Accumulated experience suggests that the public is more comfortable with fusion power proposals that promise to produce fusion energy smoothly, in a continuous burn. Fusion technologies like ICF that reliably produce fusion in a succession of short controlled bursts are not as comfortable a concept (and tend to not get funded, even if they are in fact just as safe and are far more practical).During the cold war, the military was only interested in fusion devices that produced military relevant energy yields and blast effects. Big was good and was what the military requested of Lab weapons developers. Nuclear designers at LLNL and LANL were for the most part not funded to do sustained development of smaller fission-fusion and pure fusion devices intended for ultra-clean ICF power generation. Commercial ICF fusion would greatly benefit from the development of much smaller pure fusion devices. Devices producing a reliable fusion yield of about 250 GJ per shot, which is about 16X smaller in energy yield than the smallest thermonuclear device ever retained in the US nuclear arsenal.The military did not have interest in developing small ultra-clean devices specifically engineered for fusion power generation, so Lab nuclear designers never went very far in that direction. It can now be revealed that there was a well funded and well led effort to produce a tactical pure fusion device for the military that did not require a fission primary and as a result, would produce virtually no radioactive fallout. Such a device could be used in a military emergency as a “last stand” defense on friendly home soil against an overwhelmingly strong conventional tank-infantry assault.DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)Note: Point 3 may be disputed.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already beenOnce classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small sub-gram DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has already been PROVEN to work. If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has alreay been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,8.6K,47.3K,779.4M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled

What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperatures and pressures that are needed for fusion to take place.But very, very slowly and inefficiently. How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-we-pouring-more-money-into-the-research-of-profitable-nuclear-fusion

Plasma and antimatter drives are purely science-fiction devices.But let's set that aside. Suppose that a time traveler from the future walked in and put working examples of all three engines on your desk (turned off, of course). What is the order of safety?The ion engine is by far the safest. It simply uses an electrical field to push charged particles out the back of the spacecraft. These engines are really weak, but they're cheaper and safer to use than even the normal rocket engines that power our current spaceships.A plasma engine would work by simply superheating material and pushing it out of the back of the spacecraft (possibly assisted by ion drive-like technology). It's more dangerous than a normal rocket, as it has a higher operating temperature, but it has the advantage that it doesn't rely on any particular chemical reaction, so it can be fueled with any material that's readily available.Antimatter is usually proposed as a powerplant rather than as a true propulsive engine. It's really dangerous, because if the fuel comes into physical contact with any part of your ship, the ship will not merely explode, but also release deadly radiation. But, on the other hand, the main alternative to antimatter in SF is nuclear power (usually fusion, though fission is an option for writers who don't want to project technical advances too far into the future), which also poses significant radiation and explosion risks. In any event, your antimatter or fusion reactor produces heat energy, which can either be directly used to power a plasma drive, or can be converted to electricity to power whatever other systems your futuristic spaceship might have.So, in summary, if the mysterious time traveler gives you an ion drive, that's safe enough. If he gives you a plasma drive, you probably should turn it over to NASA rather than playing with it yourself, but it won't kill you by just sitting there. If he gives you antimatter, though, evacuate immediately. That stuff's nasty.","2,088 followers",Manju Gangadhar,2.5K,141,1.7M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled

It would be much simpler to just detonate any of the actual fusion warheads on board if you want to instantly and thoroughly scuttle your ship.So we have to imagine that something about the fundamental design of the reactors in The Expanse - which in the show are depicted as some kind of laser-confinement reactors - lends them to suffer this kind of overload by simply tweaking their operation parameters.

It was eventually discovered that nuclear fusion powers stars.In 1920 British physicist Francis William Aston discovered that the mass equivalent of four hydrogen atoms is heavier than the mass of one helium atom (2He4), which implied that net energy can be released by combining hydrogen atoms to form helium. This provided the first hints of a mechanism by which stars could produce energy. Throughout the 1920s, Arthur Stanley Eddington became a major proponent of the proton–proton chain reaction (PP reaction) as the primary system running the Sun.[1][2] Quantum tunneling was discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1929, and shortly afterwards Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei.Rutherford understood what tremendous forces could be unleashed from the atom nucleus. In a famous 1934 experiment that opened the way to present-day fusion research (including ITER), he realized the fusion of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) into helium, observing that ""an enormous effect was produced.""The first patent related to a fusion reactor was registered in 1946 by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.

Unfortunately irregularities in the plasma and thermal losses have prevented a continuous sustained reaction.In inertial confinement a tiny container of cryogenic hydrogen fuel is ablated and heated by a powerful laser array in a fashion analogous to a tiny hydrogen bomb. The repeated fusion of a steady stream of these tiny pellets would create a controlled sustained flow of energy.Ironically one of the features of fusion reactions that helps make thermonuclear bombs practical is a potential barrier to practical fusion power generation.The highly energetic neutrons emitted from fusion can destroy the structural integrity of reactor materials and even render them temporarily radioactive.Since controlled fusion systems have so far failed to operate for prolonged periods they haven't yet had to face this problem.A second issue with intense neutron flux is that it can be used to generate plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons production.Such issues mean that fusion power may not prove to be the “clean, endless” source of electricity that some proponents believe.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

On to reality.Any real fusion reactor is going to have to somehow bring small nuclei like deuterium or tritium close enough together so that the strong nuclear force will take hold and fuse those nuclei and release energy. The problem is that the strong force has limited range whereas the electric force has unlimited range and is quite strong itself, and it always pushes nuclei away from each other.In order to bring those nuclei close enough to overcome the electric force the nuclei have to be moving really, really fast. There are two ways to do that (that I am aware of).One way isInertial confinement does not yet work so well (or ever?) in the less destructive machines we have built such as theThe second way to whack small nuclei together hard enough and often enough to extract useful energy from their fusion is to make make them move fast enough by confining them in a “magnetic bottle” and heating them with radio waves.

Elon Musk seems a wise choice, as he gets much press (even encourages that?), has many followers on twitter, has excited the public about battery-cars (more for performance and status than “saving the planet”), re-using space vehicles, dreams of autonomous cars and private car tunnels, and electronic brain implants.In reality, many of these ideas haven’t panned out. Tesla no longer states that their in-work Full Self Driving software will allow autonomous driving and their suggested robo-taxis are years late and appear still far off. SpaceX is facing a near-term crisis as Elon just realized that their large Raptor engine has major problems, while their StarLink internet system profitability relies upon it and their in-work StarShip vehicle. Meanwhile, their low-orbit satellites are already beginning to fall back to Earth. The Las Vegas Boring Co tunnel has turned out nothing like the renderings of autonomous buses, relying instead upon drivers in normal Tesla cars shuttling passengers thru narrow tunnels. Elon’s earlier push for a vacuum-pod HyperLoop system seems to have fallen by the wayside. But, Elon regularly pivots to new ideas, none original and many even from cover drawings on 1960’s Popular Mechanics magazines, but after Elon promotes them his large fanbase proclaims it “genius”, which is why he is a major influencer.More nefarious has been his influencing investments like crypto. He pushed Doge-coin, which began as a joke but now has a valuation of $21B with perhaps no basis behind it. He has also dabbled in politics, where his opinions surprised his more liberal followers, such as his Trumpish terming CV-19 as “just a flu”, “gone by April”, and suggesting hydroxychloroquine as a cure. He has sparred with former Sec. of Labor Robert Reich on twitter over unions and worker rights. He even responded to a tweet by Sen. Bernie Sanders like a petulant child might with “keep forgetting you are still alive”. He tweeted a nasty sexual comment to Sen Ron Wyden in response to taxing billionaires, plus an allusion to Jack In the Box restaurant workers masturbating on their burgers. This seems to only embolden his millennial followers who grew up typing rude comments in online video games. Musk is attuned to our new web-world where considered thought and decency has been replaced by mob rule, so don’t fault Time’s choice.","19,199 followers",Jim Cantrell,4.2K,0,0,5.0,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-solar-power-for-cryptocurrency-mining

Following the growth of Tesla shares, the value of the assets of this American entrepreneur exceeded $ 185 billion. Ilan Company put a computer chip mask in the pig's brain Tesla's Founder Dream: A network of underground streets in Los Angeles The Titan Project and the story of Ilan Mask's offer to Apple Ilan Mask unveiled the first high-speed underground tunnel Successful test of 'Spacecraft' by SpaceX But what is the secret of his success? I talked about this with Ilan Musk for about an hour a few years ago, and now that he has just had some success, I decided to wrap up my interview and share it with you. So here are you and Ilan Mask's tips for business success: 1- It is not a question of money This is a key point in Ilan Mask's approach to business. When I interviewed him in 2014, he said he did not know how rich he was: ""It's not like there's a lot of cash out there. ""Those votes are valuable."" Mr Musk does not oppose hoarding ""in a just and moral way"" but says the main motivation is not money. An approach that seems to have worked. Tesla Model X90's display at a trade show in Brussels Image source, GETTY IMAGES Image description, Tesla Model X90's display at a trade show in Brussels Mr. Musk's fortunes, inspired by Tony Stark, the main character in the Iron Man movie series starring Robert Downey Jr., reached perhaps $ 10 billion in 2014 at the time of this interview. His electric car maker, Tesla, has done particularly well. The company's stock has grown significantly in recent years, reaching a current value of more than $ 700 billion. With that money, you can buy Ford, General Motors, Biamo, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler, and still have enough money to buy a Ferrari. But Mr. Musk, who turns 50 this year, does not expect the rich to die. He said he thought he would spend most of his money building a base on Mars, and he would not be surprised if all his wealth was spent on the project. Like Bill Gates, he probably sees the billions of dollars in his bank account at the time of his death as a sign of failure because it means he has not used his wealth well. 2.

Programs End of podcast Building a base on Mars is the key to understanding what Ilan Mask sees as key to success. ""You want everything to get better in the future,"" he told me. ""You want these exciting new things to make life better."" Take SpaceX, for example. He told me he started the company because he expected the US space program to be more ambitious. ""I was expecting to go beyond Earth, take humans to Mars and build a base on the moon,"" he said. When that did not happen, the idea for the Mars Oasis mission came to him; The project aimed to send a miniature greenhouse to the Red Planet. By doing so, Ilan Musk wanted to get people interested in space again, forcing the US government to increase NASA's budget. But as he worked to launch the project, he realized that ""there is no lack of will"" and that space technology was costing more than it should. And so the world's least expensive missile launch company came into being. The SpaceX rocket is being prepared for a test launch at the company's facility in Boka Chika, Texas. Image source, REUTERS Image description, The SpaceX rocket is being prepared for a test launch at the company's facility in Boka Chika, Texas. But the important thing is that his goal was not to make money, but to take humans to Mars. Musk told me that he considered himself more of an engineer than an investor, and that his interest in finding solutions to tactical problems motivated him to wake up every morning. And that's his criterion for measuring progress, not filling his bank account. He knows full well that every obstacle he leaves behind in his business will help all those who are looking for a solution to a similar problem, and the effect will be lasting. That's why a few years ago, shortly before this interview, he announced that he was universalizing Tesla's patent patents to speed up the process of building electric vehicles around the world. 3- Do not be afraid of having big thoughts One of the highlights of Ilan Mask is his boldness and recklessness in business.

It is very difficult to create these pressures on earth because we don't have the gravitational mass that a star has so we have to compensate by increasing the temperature even higher and doing what we can to confine the nuclei (magnetic confinement) so they collide. Raising the temperature this high requires a tremendous amount of energy and powering the confinement system does too. We can do it, but we haven't sustained it long enough for it to power itself (called breakeven -- where we are getting as much energy out as we are putting into it). Once we can achieve breakeven, the fusion reactor will then be able to power itself. Naturally though, even when this occurs, you basically have a little star on earth that has to be confined by actual materials instead of gravity, especially the supercooled electromagnets so that presents all sorts of engineering issues. The electromagnets keep the plasma from touching the walls of the container but again, once you start generating enough heat from the fusion energy dissipating, you have to get that heat out of there extremely quickly or else the temperature of the supercooled electromagnets increases which decrease the magnetic permeability -- weakening the magnetic field -- and thereby decreases the pressure... so then you stop fusing.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-we-not-get-Nuclear-Fusion-to-work-effectively

I cover a few below, take from myReducing Conduction:Conduction is the loss of mass.  The electrons and ions escape when they touch surfaces.  Energy leaves with this mass.  Conduction losses kill Fusors.  Fortunately, we can steer the ions and electrons.  Like cars on a highway, they will follow electric and magnetic field lines.  Hence any solution, cannot have fields that run into surfaces (high re circulation).  The Polywell is a fusor variant which follows this rule.  Tokamaks, the levitating dipole, spheromaks and stellarators all reduce conduction in the same way.  But, sharply curving fields are not perfect.  Plasma will drift outwards in a curved field.  This flings it against the walls [68].  This could be reduced by lowering the overall temperature [49, page 43].  The polywell and biconic cusp may also lose mass by scattering it through the center [52].Reducing Radiation:Radiation is the loss of energy.  Plenty of energy leaves the cloud as light.  Radiation includes visible, x-ray, infrared and ultraviolet.  When electrons are packed densely enough, they will reabsorb this energy [17].  This is why lead can absorb x-rays [53].  In plasmas, this critical density is difficult to reach.  The x-rays may also be reflected off the chamber walls [54].  However, the plasma may not be dense enough to reabsorb the reflected light [17].There (may) also be opportunities to tune the plasma.   Though thermalized bell curves are the most common plasma system, non-thermal plasma do exist and no one really knows how long they could be trapped for.  The plasma trap is inexorably connected to the energy distribution of the plasma inside it - and this really drives the radiation losses.  The hypothetical, ideal distribution for the polywell is shown below.Raising Efficiency:Efficiency may be the most unexplored concept in fusion.  Efficiency means changing the input and output energies.  Few groups explore lowering the input power.  The NIF system is horribly inefficient.  For every unit of laser energy, about 200 times that amount in electrical energy is used [69].  In response, the naval research labs have designed a 7% efficient laser.  However, without ignition this will not matter [70].Increasing output power means finding better ways to capture the energy.  Three methods have been purposed.  The first is using the neutrons from fusion to recharge fission material [71].  This seems unlikely for cost effectiveness.  It may be a good commercial application for fusors.  The second is using heat to capture the energy.  This method is valid for deuterium and deuterium tritium fuel and will have a typical power plant efficiency.  The last method is using direct conversion to capture the energy.Direct Conversion:Direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage.  This voltage drives electricity in a wire.  This becomes the electrical power.  People usually see this process in reverse.  Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion.  Direct conversion does the opposite. It has been described is a linear accelerator running backwards [90].  William Barr deserves a share of credit for demonstrating direct conversion.  Over ten years he developed experimental and theoretical systems to prove this concept.  Dr. Barr retired from Livermore and passed away in 2004 [72].Material from a fusion reactor has positive ions, negative electrons and neutrals.  The exhaust comes in as random gas.  The converter has to beat this stuff into submission and extract energy from it.  The basic design is shown here [74, 75, 76].Bottom line: there are LOTS of good fusion ideas out there, and LOTS of unexplored approaches.  But, without the funding or manpower we will never know if they will amount to a commercially viable net power reactor.Citations:69.  Moses, Edward I.

Witkowski states that he was given access to the transcript of Sporrenberg’s statements by an unidentified present day Polish intelligence officer, and that he was allowed to take some notes but not to copy the original papers. To my knowledge he has never disclosed the identity of his contact in Poland’s spy agency.A number of postwar writers, particularly Joseph Farrell and Henry Stevens, have speculated that The Bell had something to do with Nazi interest in anti-gravity, as did Witkowski himself. The WWII German scientific enterprise was in fact interested in exotic concepts such as anti-gravity and zero point energy, but it is unlikely that Die Glocke had anything to do with these, at least not directly or specifically. (Note that of the two, zero point energy research was much the more legitimate and comprehensive effort, and was directly related to other German work in the fields of quantum mechanics, extreme cold, and superdense elements. Explorations of ZPE continue today.Rather, there is fragmentary but fairly consistent evidence pointing to The Bell as a kind of alternate technology for the breeding of fissile elements for use in nuclear weapons—specifically, that it was an early attempt at building what is today known as an “accelerator driven system” or ADS.Computer Graphic Image of the Likely Appearance of “Die Glocke”.Accelerator-driven subcritical reactor - WikipediaAccelerator-driven Nuclear EnergyThis device was said to have been nicknamed “the beehive” because it produced a loud buzzing sound when in operation. It was also claimed that both human and animal tissues would suffer catastrophic damage if in close proximity to the machine while it was running. This would be consistent with the presence of extremely powerful electromagnetic fields and related phenomena.Keep in mind that nearly the entire late war, underground German secret weapons empire was the domain of the SS and supervised by Sporrenberg’s superior, the notorious General Ing (Engineer) Hans Kammler. Of all the WWII NaziGunson believes, and I concur, that the German approach from this end of their nuclear weapons effort may have employed a technology known as “recoil based fuel breeding”. The extract of the 2008 paper, “Recoil Based Fuel Breeding Fuel Structure” by Liviu Popa-Simil states:In nuclear reactors, the use of nano-particulate pellets could facilitate the recoil implantation for breeding, transmutation and partitioning purposes. Using enriched 238U or 232Th leads to 239Pu and 233U production while using other actinides as 240Pu, 241Am etc. leads to actinide burning. When such a lattice is immersed into a radiation resistant fluid (water, methanol, etc.), the recoiled product is transferred into the flowing fluid and removed from the hot area using a concentrator/purifier, preventing the occurrence of secondary transmutation reactions.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231955480_Recoil_Based_Fuel_Breeding_Fuel_StructureNazi Bell UncoveredThe Bell is believed to have utilized extraordinarily high voltage electrical currents which may have converted thorium-232 into the fourth state of matter—plasma—and then transmuted it into very pure, weapons grade uranium-233, perhaps with the help of a mysterious substance (red mercury?) code-named “Xerum 525”. Although Popa-Simil’s paper is talking about recoil based fuel breeding in (presumably—) conventional modern nuclear reactors, as far as I know it is possible that the same or similar process could also have worked via plasma physics. In addition, another, more recent paper mentions a number of concepts and substances related to the thorium fuel cycle in certain types of reactors, and which are known to have been explored, though perhaps in different contexts and from different starting points, by the Germans in WWII. The abstract for this document states:Thorium is a fertile element that can be applied in the conceptual blanket design of a fusion-fission hybrid energy reactor, in which 232Th is mainly used to breed 233U by capture reaction. It is essential to validate 232Th nuclear data by carrying out integral fusion neutronics experiments for macroscopic thorium assemblies. The thorium assemblies with a D-T fusion neutron source consist of a polyethylene shell, depleted uranium shell, and thorium oxide cylinder.From the 2018 paper, “Fusion Neutronics Experiments for Thorium Assemblies”, By Rong Liu.“D-T” is physics shorthand for “deuterium - tritium”, substances commonly used in various types of thermonuclear weapons. At least some WWII German research and development was certainly moving in this direction. The Germans are also known to have been interested in thorium as bomb fuel by way of the thorium to proactinium to U-233 decay chain.William Pellas's answer to How close did Nazi Germany come to creating an operational nuclear weapon during WWII? Would they have been able to use it on their V2 rockets?If we allow for the possibility that certain superdense elements or substances can serve as triggers for fusion bombs—as is claimed in some sources—then it may be that the purpose of the Bell was to make Xerum 525 itself. In any case it seems most likely that the mysterious NaziCherry red and very dangerousA Suggested Schematic for a Red Mercury Fusion Bomb. This Type of Weapon May Have Been Pursued by WWII German Nuclear Scientists.Witkowski states in the video above that Walter Gerlach—who was definitely one of the greatest German scientists of that era—was the main theoretical scientist who was working on Die Glocke. The infamous Austrian scientist Ronald Richter was also said to have been involved with The Bell, which would seem to point to an attempt at utilizing some kind of exotic approach to nuclear fusion involving extremely high temperatures. Plasma physics would be a natural offshoot of this sort of methodology. It is known that both Gerlach and Richter were major figures in the German Army’s clandestine nuclear weapons project, which was run through theRonald Richter, Genius or Nut?More on the Value of Ronald Richter’s WorkFusion EnergyIcarus Interstellar, Interstellar flight, | Icarus InterstellarThe Huemul ProjectDr. Freidwardt WinterbergDr. Ronald RichterSources vary as to whether one or perhaps as many as four “Bells” were completed. One was allegedly airlifted to Argentina at war’s end, and it is claimed that this is confirmed by declassified Argentine documents—though others say no such documents exist.Again, there are tantalizing traces, hints, and documentary fragments, but definitive answers as to The Bell’s purpose are still elusive and firm conclusions are not possible given the sparse testimony in the historical record which has come to light thus far.

If everything goes well enough, we might see that happening.And I say well enough, because as you have seen and you will see with COVID-19, is that a pandemic can set us back many years.Still let me guess. You want to understand why so late, right?And I'll be explaining the why below.So what is needed for interstellar travel?A spaceship! Obviously.But what do we need to make that ship a true ark to send us to the stars?— First and foremost we need power. Nuclear power!And we need it to be powerful, safe, and which fuel can preferably be easily obtained and stored.The best candidate by far is Nuclear Fusion.Nuclear Fission simply doesn't provide enough power. And storing and using the fuel necessary can be tricky to say the least. Especially because of the radioactivity.Antimatter would be ideal for propulsion, but any failure in the containment of antimatter could spell the end of the ship and everyone on board, in a heartbeat.So Nuclear Fusion it has to be, until something better is discovered.— After getting Nuclear Fusion to work we'll need to scale down the reactor. So it can he used in a spaceship, and not occupy too much space.In order to scale it down, we'll need room temperature superconductors.And to get room temperature superconductors, we'll need nanotechnology to get them.— Room temperature superconductors will also be necessary if we want to have nuclear propulsion.If we want to have a form of plasma propulsion powered by the Fusion Reactors, then we'll need superconductive technology.With that kind of technology we can make the ship easily reach at least 50% the speed of light. Which would be the ideal travel speed for slower than light travel.— We'll also need nanotechnology to develop the necessary metamaterials.Metamaterials that can more effectively handle damage and block off radiation.— Suspended animation or hybernation technology.Let's face it. If you want to send enough people to another planet then the best way for them to make that trip is if most of the crew is put into a temporary sleep.With the necessary operational crew rotation, so as to not have mental breakdowns or other issues.If the entire crew was kept awake, then the food supplies requirements alone, might not be enough to make the trip.Not unless we can create 3D printers, that can print food. Which would be the ideal in case of hybernation not being an option.— Artificial gravity through use of centrifugal force, is easy to do. And we would need it, if we want to be able to land on the planet we are heading.— Another important key piece of technology that needs to be invented, is to create an entire new type of telescope that worked more like a spacial scanner.Why is it necessary? Why wouldn't regular telescopes serve the purpose needed?You see, the closest solar system at 50% the speed of light, would still take us nearly 9 years to get there.So if the planet we are aiming for is already showing signs of problems, for human colonization, then there's really no point going there. Is there?The optimal scenario would be that we have spacial scanners, that would allow us to retrieve and analyze information bypassing the limits of the speed of light.Which may be possible through use of Quantum Mechanics.Still even without it, we could still make the trip. Only like so many things in life, it may be a trip leading to a dead end.— Faster than light communications would also be ideal. But again… Not strictly necessary.After all once the ship got far enough into outerspace, no help could ever be sent in time to do anything about it.So the checklist is this:And this is it.Once we have all of this then we can venture into the stars.","30,850 followers",Ken Miyamoto,1.7K,5.8K,91.2M,30.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-we-not-get-Nuclear-Fusion-to-work-effectively

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of cold war underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some tens of meters away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1980 - 1992) could not provide the driver energy required to produce full fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed to make full ICF fusion ignition with energy gain work (driver energy >20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly producing full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel. These experiments were once classified but DOE declassified about half of Hailte-Centurion fusion related information and allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl reveal the declassified material.During the cold war LANL and LLNL did preliminary pure fusion device designs but were not successful with 1970s fusion driver technology. In the year 2001 DOE permitted disclosure of the fact that the US had a well organized and well funded sustained effort to produce ultra-clean pure fusion devices.RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html(see section C of this document)NIF is currently only capable of delivering about 2.15 MJ of energy to the windows of the fusion hohlraum (and about 26 kJ of X-ray energy to the actual fusion capsule holding the fusion fuel). NIF produces short bright powerful light pulses on the order of about 100 femtoseconds in width but delivers only 1/1000th the energy to the fusion capsule as was deposited in successful practical cold war Halite-Centurion experimental field tests that produced full ICF fusion ignition and burning plasma.Losses inside the hohlraum reduce delivered laser energy to the actual fusion capsule to around 26 kilojoules of energy. NIF is currently not capable of producing full fusion ignition but succeeds in operating in a ""alpha-heating"" regime that occurs just prior to full fusion ignition.Graph showing contributions of Alpha Heating at NIFWhat is lacking in current ICF fusion experiments to support building of practical ICF fusion power plants is a fusion driver with characteristics close enough to the driver employed by LANL and LLNL in Halite-Centurion tests to permit full fusion ignition with energy gain. The needed driver should be capable of delivering greater than 20 MJ into a focused spot less than a 2 mm in diameter in time of less than 3 nanoseconds. The current NIF laser driver is capable of delivering about 2 MJ total energy and is only able to achieve ""alpha heating"" phase of fusion operation - a stage that immediately precedes fusion ignition. LASNEX and HYDRA computer simulations of the mid-1990s on which LLNL based the engineering design of the NIF laser were overly optimistic in predicting the required fusion driver characteristics to produce ignition. Failure of the mid-1990s LASNEX and HYDRA simulations resulted in NIF being built too small to achieve the goal of fusion ignition and for NIF to serve as the technical basis of the LIFE ICF fusion power plant. It must also however be admitted that beside driver energy and power, there are other slightly lower priority (but still important) unsolved engineering issues for ICF including implosion symmetry and plasma instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor) that rob energy from ICF plasma when it nears fusion conditions. Use of a more robust fusion driver such as was employed in cold war Halite-Centurion X-ray initiated DT fusion experiments permitted slightly less than optimum symmetry and mild plasma instabilities and still work under slightly sub-optimum conditions and produce DT fusion ignition with production of energy gain.While ICF pure fusion is being held back by inadequate fusion driver technology (lasers or particle accelerators) - the four decade sustained progress in the field of High Power Pulsed Lasers has been phenomenal. Fast Pulse lasers are rapidly improving relative to other possible ICF fusion drivers. While lasers are getting more powerful - they are also getting physically smaller and cheaper to build and operate.Progress in the power of Fast Pulse Lasers exceeds sustained progress in any other technical field (including semiconductors - Moore’s Law) -High Power Pulsed LasersIt is however the case that in the current environment of sustained rapid technical progress, laser drivers are still too small to reliably produce ICF DT fusion ignition. Successful ICF fusion ignition requires both high delivered power combined with sufficient total energy to produce full fusion conditions in the ICF fusion capsule.Practical Commercial Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants that actually make commercial electricity (and in a time frame that makes a difference) -Dr. Ralph Moir has designed several Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants.

Note they haven’t conquered gravity yet….they cheat and get around it, but the benefits are only incidental, not primary. We drastically need to reduce our energy consumption but that requires a much smaller population. That is not going to happen. Although we have a low birthrate as compared to nature, our survivability is off the charts so we have a massive and growing population. We are close to “done” in terms of modern civilization.",3 followers,Steve Baker,1.2K,27.3K,162.3M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

This will actually prove to be important in how fast fusion can be brought to commercial reality and rapidly deployed worldwide.Nuclear Fusion – Smaller Cheaper & SoonerWhile it is common to consider D-T fusion when making comparisons in fission versus fusion arguments, in a long term perspective it is probably better to use D-D fusion to represent the fusion case.D-D fusion is cheaper and more long term sustainable than D-T fusion (there is at present only enough worldwide supply of Tritium to keep a 1 GWe D-T fusion power plant fueled and running for 2 months while there is enough Deuterium in the world’s oceans, 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons, to supply all of the earth’s need for power at a 17 TW level for 29 billion years).D-D fusion is also more energetic by weight of fuel than D-T fusion when all fusion reactions including side-chains go to completion. Of all nuclear reactions (fission or fusion) – D-D fusion of pure Deuterium separated from sea water produces the highest energy yield per kilogram of fuel consumed.It is to be regretted that D-D fusion is slightly more complex than D-T fusion and produces energy through four reactions instead of one reaction like D-T. The additional complexity of four versus one reaction may tend to put off science writers and commentators – so DT fusion routinely gets more coverage in the popular press. In a longer term perspective, it is probable that D-D fusion will be of greater overall historical significance and will in the future produce a large portion of future energy required to power our world.The four D-D fusion reactions (and the net effect reaction):D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:The energy output that results from all four D-D fusion reactions is 3.439248 x 10^8 MJ/kg. The temperature a fusion reactor must achieve to produce an efficient D-D plasma burn is 350 million K.Nuclear Fusion Summary – Prospects for breakthrough commercial reactors 2018-2025Brian Wang of the Next Big Future Blog updates hisThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium. The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy. In the year 2018 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.While nuclear fusion is frequently derisively denounced as ""always only 50 years away"", are there currently real reasons for optimism?Regulatory obstacles to nuclear fusion reactors are currently much lower than obstacles impeding the development of innovative nuclear fission reactors. While this may not seem like a significant thing, I believe that it will prove to be important in how fast fusion can be brought out in commercial forms[1].Tom McGuire, lead project engineering at the Lockheed skunkworks and chief designer of the Lockheed Compact Fusion Device has announce the intension to build a new prototype CFD reactor a year until a commercially viable fusion power plant is demonstrated. McGuire expects to achieve a commercial power generating reactor in 5 years (or 5 experimental prototype development cycles). This kind of intense development effort is not possible in the fission universe as a result of obstructive NRC regulation.Conclusion _ While a harder physics problem, small fusion will be available in commercial forms before any form of new Gen-IV fission reactor.Robert Steinhaus's answer to What's our current progress on nuclear fusion power and what problems remain ?[1] - Fission versus Fusion?If you want to innovate and build a fission reactor you need from NRC -1) A design certification to ensure your basic reactor design is safe – cost ~$200 million2) A COL license to allow you to construct and operate your fission reactor – cost ~ $60 million3) Once licensed, you will have to pay each year an operating fee to NRC of ~$5 million dollars whether your reactor is operating or not – whether it is producing electricity or process heat or not.4) A license to obtain fission nuclear fuel for your prototype reactor must be obtained from NRC - private sale or purchase of nuclear fuels is illegal and can result in jail time.5) A Waste Confidence Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared and submitted to NRC to describe how you plan to sequester any nuclear waste produced by your fission reactor prototype. NRC must approve your plan before you are allowed to allow your reactor to go critical and produce any fission power. Your will need to pay NRC staff evaluating your Environmental Impact Statement at a rate of $273 an hour until such time as NRC staff are satisfied with all elements of your plan.6) When you decide you can no longer continue operating your prototype reactor, you will have to pay NRC during reactor decommissioning. Former reactor operators are required to pay NRC staff at a rate of $273 per hour of time they are involved in supervising the decommissioning of your reactor prototype.In contrast, the obstacles to Fusion reactor innovation –1) No regulatory obstacles currently exit in the US preventing prototyping of fusion reactors.2) You can freely and legally build fusion reactors in your home basement or at school without interference of any kind from NRC.3) You can legally buy high purity fusion fuels (D2O – which can be electrolyzed to 99.99% pure Deuterium) on e-Bay for less than $10.4) OPEN SOURCE design guides and plans can be freely downloaded on the internet for several good fusion reactor designs.

The best estimate of the total power being radiated in light from the sun isHowever the star Sirius has about 50 times the Sun’s luminosity, and there are stars that emit 20–30 thousand times as much power, such very bright stars are, however, much shorter lived than is the Sun.There is a small additional radiant energy flux in neutrinos and there is some energy released from the Sun in the form of the solar wind as well. All of this energy originates from fusion, and the Sun has been fusing hydrogen to helium for perhaps 4.5 billion years. However the rate of fusion has not been constant over that whole time but instead is slowly growing as the Sun ages. So in this sense, your question, how much energy does fusion produce is not terribly well-defined. One could say that in all likelihood most of the radiant energy in the universe is right now being produced by fusion. There are other contributors too, massive black holes, gamma ray bursts, supernovae, neutron star mergers, black hole mergers and other such exotic and very distant phenomena, but they are not dominant.At the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun, the solar luminosity translates to a radiant power per unit area of 1.361 kW/m^2 at the top of Earth’s atmosphere at solar minimum, and 1.362 kW/m^2 at solar maximum, a number which is called the Solar irradiance. The Sun’s total luminosity varies with the 11 year sunspot cycle by a small amount. The Sun is a weakly variable star, and as I pointed out the total power it produces is increasing over geological timescales.That 1.362 kW/m^2 arriving at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere translates into aThe integrated value of that power incident at the surface is enormous - roughly 1 hours worth of the Sun’s total output, if and this is a very big if, it could be captured, stored, and used, would be about equal to the total annual energy consumption of all of humanity. Practically speaking, however, it is a massive engineering project to capture that much energy and use it. Storing energy in particular is an extremely costly proposition with current technologies.Now, as to artificially producing fusion, I am sorry to say this, but it is a very, very difficult problem. One can’t duplicate in a laboratory on Earth, the conditions that exist deep in the core of the Sun, where gravity confines hydrogen and helium ions at a density of about 150 times the density of water, and at a temperature of about 15,000,000 degrees Kelvin, so that the protons continually collide and re-collide with each other, very occasionally fusing in an extremely slow reaction in which deuterium is formed.What has to be done on Earth is to use other fuel than protons, and people are trying with deuterium and tritium, but the creation of such high densities as exist in the Sun at the needed temperature for a large amount of hydrogen fuel, and for a very long time, so as to produce fusion as the Sun does, is simply not an option on Earth. Most of the approaches to creating fusion power artificially work by producing very high temperatures instead, much higher than those existing in the core of the Sun. There are a number of approaches to doing it, none of which are at the present time practical.The one approach to producing fusion energy that really can be said to work right now is the mechanism employed in thermonuclear weapons, in which a small nuclear fission weapon is used to very efficiently compress, heat and ignite a secondary containing fusion fuel. But employing nuclear weapons as sources of energy is not likely to go over well with the public, given their general attitude towards nuclear power, and there are obvious practical problems and also serious dangers associated with such an approach.So now, and for the foreseeable future, I suspect that the closest we will get to practical fusion power is probably 93 million miles, which is about 1 AU, the mean distance from the Sun.I sincerely hope that I am very wrong, but I have been watching the discussions of fusion energy for almost forty years now, and the technical problems that are involved are simply very difficult problems which are arising from fundamental physics. It is best to concentrate on means of producing useful energy that are actually available right now, in order to be able to maintain civilization at a high rate of energy use until a transition to a far lower and constant rather than exponentially growing world population, and a lower overall demand for energy to do useful work, can be completed.That’s not to say don’t do any research into fusion, but it would be very irresponsible to claim that it will be solving the world’s energy problems any time soon.",825 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,19.0,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype.

There are about 10^11 times more fusion fuel in the universe than all fission nuclear and fossil fuels combined.Efforts to bring fusion to commercial reality will be rewarded.The ultimate potential of D-D Fusion is very great -Fusion Energy from the D-D fusion reaction longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium. The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-years of energy. In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).------Large tokamak magnetic fusion designers often tend to discount the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction because it is not possible to achieve the necessary fusion reaction rates and break-even energy with D-D fusion using tokamaks and stellarator devices such as we currently are able build. The situation is different, however, with Inertial Confinement Fusion which typically employs a fusion plasma that are literally 10^11 times more dense than the typical ion plasma densities used in MCF tokamaks or stellarators.The power than can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the second power of the plasma ion density. Even small improvements in plasma ion density will result in significant improvements in the performance of a fusion experiment.There is an impressively large Range of plasma density in current and planned fusion experimentsThere is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between MCF and ICF fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV-------Fusion and neutronsDT and DD fusion release large amounts of their fusion energy in the form of fast neutrons.The task of shielding fast neutrons requires• Fast Neutrons (E >1 MeV) must first be thermalized with highneutron scattering materials (typically materials that have a high percentage of light atoms like hydrogen)• These thermal neutrons can then be absorbed or shielded with material having high cross sections for neutron absorptionAbsorption of thermalized neutrons can be done by relatively light materials like polyethylene plastic unlike gamma radiation that require lots of high-z material (lead, concrete, water) to absorb the penetrating gamma.LLNL's Dr. Ralph Moir has pioneered several molten salt fusion reactor concepts (HyLife II and PACER Revisited). A thick liquid falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorber like 50 micron particles of Boron Carbide as a slurry can absorb damaging fast neutrons. Such a thick falling wall of molten salt can effectively protect fusion chamber structure and largely prevent neutron activation of fusion reactor materials. This permits molten salt ICF fusion reactors to have long 30+ year commercial lifetimes and to at reactor end of life produce little or no neutron activated waste.Slide comparing fission and various fusion reactions from Professor Gerald KulcinskiThere are actually rather good reasons to believe that when nuclear fusion is commercially introduced, it will in short order form the basis of very commercially competitive power plants that will deliver reliable, cheap energy to all in the world that need energy.Fusion’s near term commercial potential -Not all approaches to nuclear fusion will have identical commercial characteristics. Some approaches to nuclear fusion will not in the end be able to produce any actual energy beyond what is required to operate the fusion experiment and as a result will effectively become fusion research dead ends. Other fusion approaches including some that currently receive high levels of funding and international support may ultimately reach break-even energy, but these approaches to fusion may after scaling end up so extraordinarily complex and impractically huge in size may that they end up being commercially uncompetitive with fossil fuel and renewable energy power plants. Such a large experimental fusion physics demonstration may perhaps be built only a single time as a kind of technology proof of principle, but then go no further and never get built in any significant numbers by communities needing cost competitive electrical power.Plasma Density matters when competing to produce cheap energy -Approaches to fusion that routinely use very low density plasma, like tokamaks (ITER) and stellarators (W7-x) will have to be physically larger and contain a much greater volume of fusion plasma than fusion devices that routinely operate on denser plasma. There is literally a 10^11 difference in operating plasma density at fusion conditions between Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices like tokamaks and stellarators and Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Experiments like NIF. This is a huge natural competitive advantage to ICF fusion in terms of potential commercial competitiveness.Comparison between the fusion chamber volume of an Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment (NIF) versus a Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiment (ITER) -(notice man in lower right corner for scale)Those who advocate Magnetic Confinement fusion devices will be quick to point out however that ICF fusion currently requires a large stationary football field sized laser fusion driver to ignite the small high plasma density ICF fusion capsules. This is true, but the size and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers is dropping very rapidly (and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers are also dropping at a rapid rate) and the impact of the laser fusion driver is destined to be a shrinking contributor to ICF fusion power plant physical size and cost.The power that a pulse laser fusion driver can deliver has increased roughly by a factor of 1000 every decade for the last 40 years. This is in fact a stronger sustained technical advance than even Moore’s law (transistors on a CPU chip).Cost of fusion power generators that can operate using high density fusion plasma -As previously mentioned, the physically smallest and least costly commercial fusion power plants of the future will probably operate using the highest density fusion plasma. Approaches to fusion that cannot operate on a least medium density plasma (10^18 ions/cm^3) will probably not be able to compete, head to head, with fossil fuel or renewable energy power plants.LPP Fusion is currently a private sector small fusion leader in the quest for fusion and is expected to use medium density fusion plasma in their Dense Plasma Focus fusion device. LPP Fusion has produced the following slide as a cost goal for their small modular commercial fusion device.These is a respectably low and impressive cost estimate for small fusion.The Department of Energy EIA's findings suggest that natural gas–fired power plants are cheaper to build with overnight capital costs ranging fromLPP Fusion’s DPF device would be 10X or more cheaper to build and would produce 10X cheaper electricity than the cheapest current form of natural gas power plant.ICF fusion power plants that use the densest fusion plasma have the potential to be the most cost competitive of all small fusion approaches when the technology becomes commercially available.As fusion power plants advance to commercial reality over the next decade, they should improve in power density and decrease in cost.Small Fusion: step by step and one step at a time.Effort to bring fusion to commercial reality will be rewarded.The investment in fusion technology will be justified and the low cost power that fusion will generate will lift billions of people around the world currently without any access to electricity out of chronic grinding poverty and want.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,22.0,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

Those renewables keep getting cheaper and more reliable, making competitively-priced electricity from terrestrial fusion less likely to be competitive in future.When people ask about the prospects for nuclear fusion power, the answer has traditionally been “25 to 50 years away” from when ever you ask. In the 1960’s nuclear fusion power was 25 to 50 years away, in the 1990’s nuclear fusion power was 25 to 50 years away. Today? Park that thought.Where are we today? I’d say much closer.

I see something that looks a lot like an existing nuclear fission power plant except maybe more complicated and with larger internal losses. Given that nuclear fission power plants are struggling to compete right now, I just don’t see something that is more expensive again and has a lower output will be able to produce the sorts of profit that would be required for widespread uptake.There is a possibility that one of the many other fusion experiments might actually achieve the result before ITER, but that seems unlikely to me. For example, when Lockheed Martin announced theirIn conclusion, I’m optimistic that humanity will eventually achieve “useful” nuclear fusion power, maybe even in my lifetime (but probably not).

And obviously it is feasible, since the sun does it without any engineering at all!""Well no. First of all, the sun has half a million km thick insulation keeping the inside hot and half a million km thick deadweight pushing down from all directions keeping it compressed.Those 2 things are impossible to duplicate on Earth. Not just ""hard""; impossible.And even if they could be duplicated, then the rate of fusion inside the sun is so incredibly slow, taking around 10 billion years before a typical H fuses, that it would be utterly useless.Lots of people, even congressmen, know light-H fusion (the sun & stars) is vastly too hard and D-T fusion is much easier. So given that wide knowledge, a slightly trickier lie was needed.Sadly D and especially T are not so easily acquired as ordinary hydrogen. Indeed T (tritium) does not even exist on Earth (except perhaps for ultra microscopic quantities produced occasionally by cosmic rays or something). So then, according to a myth widely circulated to suckers by fusion-propagandists and con-men, we can solve humanity's energy problems easy-peasy by extracting deuterium (D) and lithium from SEAWATER (practically infinite supply!), convert lithium to tritium (T), then do D+T fusion; only waste products are harmless (and actually useful) helium, so just be incredibly happy and fund fusion research with $100 billions please forever!But that all is a lie that never will work, and anybody competent should know it never will work. Let me explain.First of all, even with D and T, the easiest fusion reaction, if you simply accelerate D in a cyclotron and fire it at a T target (or vice versa) then you will NOT get enough fusion energy produced to pay for the cost of acceleration. This experiment has been tried at every conceivable speed. None work, not even with a hypothetical 100% efficient cyclotron, at any setting whatever. So the only possible way to make D+T fusion work is to keep your D&T hot (costing zero energy once you have it hot, if your insulation is 100% effective) allowing multiple collision attempts not just one. That'd work fine except that no insulation yet devised has been anywhere near good enough, and the hot D+T want to explode out of there, not stay where you want it to stay. The best anybody has come up with to overcome that is to keep making your fusion reactors bigger & thicker, so it takes longer for D+T to leave and so you effectively get more insulation keeping the heat in there longer. The sizes then become enormous making it ultra expensive.Now let's look at the nuclear reactions we need. (Notation: D = deuterium = H-2, T = tritium = H-3.) The fusion reaction isD + T --> He-4 + n + 17.59 MeV (1)by far the easiest fusion reaction -- which means it is so vastly difficult that nobody has ever come close to achieving ""break even"" (despite several widely circulated published lies, told to the US government and general public about this, saying break-even already happened, it in fact never did, nor even came close, not even with various lying fake-redefinitions of the term “breakeven”).The ingredients needed are D which is naturally present in the oceans -- about 1 atom D per 6420 light-hydrogen atoms. And T: that unfortunately is very dangerous stuff, since radioactive with halflife 12.32 years.I used to live near the Princeton tokomak, and they told many lies to the public. (For example the lie that they had achieved “breakeven.”) One of their utterly irresponsible stunts was to run with D+T causing their entire incredibly huge and expensive reactor to become radioactive and hence no longer safely usable, which was a total waste of a vast amount of money to accomplish nothing since they could have just run with pure D; no safety risk that way, and results easily extrapolated to D+T so same science benefits, and in fact way more science benefits since reactor would keep being usable.But no, they had to go for the publicity stunt rather than acting responsibly -- which they did to try to con people into giving them funding.They told everybody the planned run was no risk and they were totally safe and there was no chance any T would leak. Bingo: First thing they then did was leak 100% of their enormous tritium supply (over a hundred pounds) irreversibly into the Princeton-Plainsboro environment, which was a vast amount of radiation, enough to kill every human on earth many times over (if that tritium were oxidized to water & fed to all humans in equal portions, they’d all die within a week).They then told everybody not to worry about it. Their story was it all went into the upper atmosphere far away. Unless it did not, since it burned, or was catalyzed, to form water -- a possibility they never ever mentioned to the media, not even for one word. Did they then go around putting up radiation detectors all over the Princeton-Plainsboro area to monitor to make sure their story was actually valid? No, of course not. That might risk revealing that something other than their story might be true, and that in turn might endanger their funding. Instead they tried to keep it all pretty quiet. My guess is about 75% of the people who lived in that area did not even know the leak happened.The tritium is produced fromn + Li-6 --> He-4 + T (2)That neutron (n) comes from a fission reactor. The fusion propagandists often lie and say fusion produces no radioactive waste (lie) and no proliferation risks since no fission reactors anymore so no longer will plutonium be widely available. That is also a lie since as we see you NEED a fission reactor to do reaction (2) at all. But then there is a propaganda claim those n's can come from the fusion reaction (1). That also is a lie. First of all, that only would work if 100% of the neutrons from (1) got used for (2), which is never ever going to come anywhere close to being true. The vast majority of the n's will fly away and never go where you want, they'll instead go where they want, destroying your ultra-expensive superconductors, ultra-expensive huge containment vessel, etc etc that make today's fusion reactors cost vastly vastly more than any fission reactor ever (despite never having achieved breakeven).I.e. the inefficiency in terms of neutron percent used versus wasted, will be huge. That will force the use of fission to generate the vast majority of the T. This means D+T fusion cannot, not even in principle, outlast fission as a sustainable energy source. Ever.The planned ITER fusion reactor, which hopes to produce about a piddly 500 MW of energy in the form of heat (which then will NOT be converted to electricity and NOT used to power any, e.g, homes -- it will simply be 100% wasted -- and it will only be able to run for a time scale of minutes before it must be shut down) from allegedly 50 MW of input power -- and thus allegedly exceed breakeven for the first time -- allegedly is going to cost about $85 billion, more expensive than any power plant ever constructed before, including ones that produce far more power and which actually work. It will rapidly self-destruct due to the fast neutrons, far faster self-destruction rate than any power plant ever before (at least intentionally) had -- thus destroying that huge investment. (Also, the 50 MW input power is a total lie, and in reality will vastly exceed that. One of the standard lie-techniques they always use is to divide the input into many different parts, then dismiss all but one of those parts. Scientists in other areas would never do that and regard it as massively unethical, but in fusion it happens pretty much every time I ever see any public statement they ever make.)And note that in net D+T fusion with T from lithium would involve two n's per 17.59 MeV output, even with the fantasy of 100% neutron efficiency.That is as compared to fission, which produces about 200 MeV per two neutrons. The fast neutrons from fusion (unfortunately vastly more energetic than neutrons from fission) destroy ANYTHING they hit, converting it into radioactive waste, and actually, as we now see, vastly MORE radioactive waste is produced per joule from fusion than from fission -- at least if ""neutron count"" is regarded as our proxy for ""amount of waste"" -- exactly contrary to their lies.That also tells us that — remembering that fission is needed to get the T to even allow D-T fusion to happen — that concomitant fission will be producting about 10 times the power produced by the fusion. So given that you need to build 10 GW of fission plant for every 1 GW fusion plant even in a fantasy world where fusion really were super easy and wonderful, why the hell even build those fusion plants at all??But ok, let's just focus on that Li-6. Natural lithium is 7.5% (atom fraction) lithium-6, with the rest being Li-7. (Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of 6.015 amu; lithium-7 has an atomic mass of 7.016 amu. The atomic mass of natural lithium is 6.941 amu.) T is made from Li-6.Seawater contains 0.18 milligrams of lithium per liter. Let us assume that separating that lithium from that liter of water, AND from everything else (i.e. all the other salts) in that water, AND purifying it, AND removing whatever the Li is chemically bonded to (e.g. chloride), AND isotopically separating into Li-6 versus Li-7... all together costs energy at least equivalent to the cost of EVAPORATING that 1 kg of water, i.e. 2.4 megajoules. I suspect that estimate is conservative, but admit I have not carefully considered the numerous unknown cleverest-possible separation schemas, partly since nobody can, since they are unknown.For anybody who insists on trying, I point out that at present, salt is commercially produced from seawater (vastly most commonly) by evaporation -- i.e. despite 2000 years of doing this commercially and research on same, no lower-cost method has come along that has taken over the sea-salt industry. And salt is way easier to get out of seawater than lithium: no need to purify, no need to isotopically enrich, don't need chemical reactions, thousands of times greater concentration. (Albeit most salt is NOT produced from seawater; instead it is mined, since producing from seawater is uneconomical by comparison. Total world salt production each year greatly exceeds total world lithium reserves for all time.)The 17.59 MeV output by reaction (1) per atom of T, or equivalently per atom of Li-6, is equivalent to 2.8*10^14 joules per kg of Li-6, i.e. equivalent to 1.8*10^13 joules per kg of natural lithium, i.e. 3.3 megajoules per liter of seawater.Now, assume your fusion reactor is at best 50% efficient. This is a very very very conservative estimate since the best fossil-fuel power plants ever made feature about 50% efficiency, and fusion is way harder, so far fusion has never achieved any positive efficiency whatsoever, not even 0.000001%.WE ARE DONE: the energy cost of obtaining the Li-6 from 1 liter of seawater, is lower bounded by 2.4 MJ. But the energy we get out of it is upper bounded by 1.6 MJ. Oops.IN OTHER WORDS: The ""we can get the Li from seawater"" claim is yet another widespread lie from fusion propagandists exposed by the pre-college-level calculation I just performed.CONCLUSION: you cannot do it by getting lithium from seawater.If we have to get it from lithium ore: the total known world reserves of lithium ore are small, about 2 million tonnes. That's considerably smaller than uranium reserves. In other words the whole lie that the ingredients needed for fusion energy are ""common"" and ""cheap"" and it is better than fission, and will keep us going longer, is all utter garbage.POSSIBLE ESCAPE ROUTE: Can you get the lithium not from seawater, nor ore, but instead from average rocks? The good news is Li abundance in earth crustal rocks is about 20 milligram per kg, i.e. about 100 times its abundance in seawater per kg. But unfortunately it is harder to extract Li from rocks than from seawater, since for one thing melting rock is a lot harder than boiling seawater. You could try to extract the Li by means of repeated cycles of remelting with fractional crystallization... I tend to doubt this will work too well... or: dissolving in acids, again with fractional crystallization could be tried (multiple cycles), then trying to recycle the waste products... I would guess that might work better... and then we need to isotopically separate...So it is highly unclear to me what the cost would be, since as far as I know nobody has ever seriously tried to extract lithium from either granite or seawater before, since both are incredibly stupid and uneconomical. That is because every mining operation that has ever been undertaken, after 1000s of years of trying, that is trying to extract something with parts-per-million concentration levels, has yielded a VERY EXPENSIVE product, and energy use is a big reason why it is so expensive. For example, gold ore in today's mines typically features concentration of 5 milligram gold per kg of ore. Know how much gold costs? Currently about $1971 per troy ounce, which is $63 per gram. Gold is quite easy to separate from ore, lithium from granite would be chemically much harder. So I might conjecture that lithium extracted from average rock, e.g. granite, would cost about $300 per gram in year-2020 dollars, which at the current price of electricity ($0.133 per kW-hr USA year-2020 average) is equivalent to 8 gigajoules of energy to perform that mining & extraction of 1 gram. I am guessing the isotopic separation will raise that $300/gram cost for rock-lithium up to about $400/gram. This is all a very rough and conjectural guess-calculation.But anyhow, a gram of lithium contains 0.075 grams of Li-6, which yields 140 gigajoules of fusion energy assuming 50% efficiency. So that (since 140>11) actually sounds promising.It would be a fairly difficult and large exercise to try to figure out the best possible cost to extract Li from ordinary rock and redo my rough calculation last paragraph justifiably correctly; and that is an effort which the fusion community simply has never lifted a finger to even start trying to do even after 70 years. That is because lying is easier and more profitable for them than actually doing research.You may be getting the impression I have an attitude of tremendous contempt for fusion research. That is correct. They are the worst. They have lied and lied for 70 years, including under oath, have a worse record of failure and lies than almost any (perhaps all) other fields of science, and they continue to lie still while still having accomplished absolutely nothing after 70 years despite more funding than almost anything. Throughout those 70 years their perpetual refrain has been in 10-20 years they'll supply us with limitless energy too cheap to meter. Then when it does not happen they say ""Oh, don't blame us, there were really really complicated unexpected problems nobody could have anticipated, but we understand all that now, so just fund us 10-20 more years to reach the land of milk and honey!"" Which was always a lie. In fact, those problems were very easy, not hard, to anticipate, BUT their livelihood depended on not anticipating them and pretending they would not exist, so they covered their eyes.And the truth, which they almost never say out loud, is that to have any hope of having any use, fusion would have to be based on a NEUTRONLESS reaction, such as B+H fusion. Only neutronless reactions can work without rapidly turning your ultra-expensive fusion plant into radioactive waste rendering it un-economical at a level beyond belief.So: not D+D, not T+D, not H+H+H+H, not almost any fusion reaction almost anybody ever hears about in fusioneering propaganda -- none are acceptable and everybody competent has always known that.But B+H is vastly vastly harder than D+T fusion (and boron is even rarer than lithium!), probably 10000 times as hard, hence vastly vastly further from ever happening, which is why they hardly ever talk about it.It would be bad for their funding if that truth were better known; and their primary desire is to lie and deceive to keep the funding train going. They do not give a crap about scientific ethics, the future of humanity and the ultimate usefulness of it all. All they care about is lying to the gullible to get more funding. I have read many government ""reports to president"", transcripts of scientist testimony to congress, public educational brochures put out by Princeton Plasma lab, etc where the lies above (& others! What I have mentioned is the tip of the iceberg) are baldly stated as ""facts.""I cannot tell whether they actually are so incompetent that they believe their own lies, or whether they lie fully intentionally. All I know is they lie, and those lies can be exposed by pre-college level calculations, and they keep on repeating those lies for 50 years, to people like presidents and congressmen whom they correctly figure will not do said calculations. I find it appalling.Many scientists know this reality, I presume -- but most are too wimpy to say it aloud and risk that an attempt will be made, backed up by enormous money and influence, to damage their careers. I however, am not one of those wimps. I've been saying this stuff my entire career, probably to its detriment, and with apparently no useful effect on the US government, which like an idiot turned off all funding for breeder fission research (an actually workable idea, but it will take many years of experimenting to make it get good -- crucial years our government has idiotically sacrificed) so that it instead could focus exclusively on fusion quackery.8 Aug 2021 News Flash:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL’s) National Ignition Facility (NIF) allegedly achieved ""ignition"" (of DT fusion fuel pellet using lasers) for the first time, producing a 1.3 MJ explosion. This allegedly exceeded the laser energy going into the pellet by a factor of 5 and broke the old energy record by a lot. Great accomplishment? No: As their scientist Omar A. Hurricane fully admitted:(A) That 1.3 MJ was only a tiny fraction of the electrical energy that powered NIF's lasers. It is sort of like a stone age man declaring to the media that he’s “invented fire” if the amount of energy he can get out of the fire is far tinier than the amount of energy he uses rubbing sticks together.(B) Zero of the ""produced"" 1.3 MJ energy was actually used to generate usable power. But even if 100% was somehow used, this would still be a total failure as a way to generate energy (see A).(C) Yes, 1.3 MJ allegedly exceeded the laser energy(D) And indeed (just in case you thought that was not “typical”) in 2013 NIF also had announced “ignition” and “breakeven” after producing a 14 kJ explosion of a pellet, powered by a 1.8 MJ laser flash as input. Note how the output was over 100X smaller than the input. Notice how now, in the 2021 Proclamation of First Ever Glorious Success they did not mention, at all, their 8 year earlier Proclamation of Glorious Success, which they now laugh at as a pathetic con job, except they do not, they just evidently now pretend it never happened.But still, (C) sounds like a notable milestone that might enable them to experimentally study ignition.More (independent of me) people who have similar opinions and/or similarly disturbing facts:Physicist Sabine Hossenfelder with a youtube video:The “New Energy Times” founded by journalist S.B.Krivit exposes many facts about fusion research and outrageous cons involved in it - in particular ITER:","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,508,6.8K,91.4M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-could-nuclear-fusion-power-stations-be-the-answer-to-all-our-power-needs-Could-it-be-cheap-and-constantly-available-What-would-the-outcome-be

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Efficient fusion devices can be built over a very wide range of yields.Unlike fission which produces an exponentially increasing run away chain reaction when super critical and will only allow a fission primary with a critical mass (or more) of fissile material to be formed;fusion is actually a plasma burn that takes an orderly, predictable, finite (short) amount of time to take place. In an efficient geometry, like a slightly tapered cylinder, yields of different size can be produced by just changing the length of the cylinder holding DT or DD fusion fuel.Are there actual applications for really large devices?(A minority view)Nuclear weapons technology has some value -toWhat if one of the millions of asteroids in our solar system was on a collision course with the Earth?What would we do?How would we react?Tracks of known mapped asteroids larger than 100 meters in size that intersect earth’s orbit.One rogue asteroid could end all human development and extinguish all life which has evolved on planet earth over the course of 2.5 billion years in a few brief seconds.If asteroids with trajectories that will strike earth are discovered early and the objects small enough, several non-nuclear mediation strategies can be proposed. Technology like large lasers orbiting in space, human and robotic intercept missions to set up small nuclear reactors to melt the asteroid surface producing thrust, or perhaps bombardment by hyper kinetic projectiles fired from earth orbit could be used to break up and deflect moderate sized asteroids.If large asteroids are discovered late as they approach earth, thermonuclear explosives could be key to defending all life on planet earth. A late detected near earth asteroid would probably be best and most reliably be deflected from collision with earth using large high-yield peaceful nuclear explosives.Would it not make some sense to expend some effort and dedicate very modest appropriations to prepare a few large planetary defense devices and engineer a delivery system to securely intercept and deflect a late discovered oncoming killer asteroid of greater than 100 meters in size on a trajectory with earth?The actual peaceful nuclear explosive technology selected would be up to designers, but D-D fusion implemented in a multi-stage fission-fusion-fusion device has produced the largest devices successfully tested on earth and would probably be the best initial technology to consider when trying to design very large defensive peaceful thermonuclear explosives for planetary defense. A shock initiated fusion secondary that initiated a thermonuclear detonation wave in a tappered cylinder of cryo-deuterium liquid held under high pressure is scaleable for yield over a very wide range. Such multistage thermonuclear devices could easily produce yields hundreds of times larger than the largest experimental thermonuclear device ever tested on earth.Picture of a two stage peaceful thermonuclear explosive device. Initiation of the spherical primary, traditionally a fission device but today, potentially a small sphere containing DT fusion fuel, which produces a shock thermonuclear detonation wave in a tuneable yield cylindrical fusion secondary.If a large asteroid is bearing down on earth and is only a few weeks out, there may not be time to design and build specialized nuclear explosives appropriate to counter the threat to all life on earth. It might be wiser and more prudent to arrange to have in readiness a few devices prepared but perhaps unfueled to use in the event an asteroid on a collision path with earth is detected.Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth's neighborhood. NASA has a program for tracking objects that could collide with earth. It is unclear whether collectively our world currently has the resources and prepared engineering measures to respond to the challenge of a killer asteroid on a collision path with earth.NEO Earth Close ApproachesThe idea that the chance of a rogue comet or meteor is so small that it does not deserve consideration and planning to avoid is probably incorrect.Within this last year, a rogue meteor was discovered only days before its closest approach to earth.Asteroid 2016 RB1 was discovered on 5th September, 2016, by astronomers using the 60″ Cassegrain reflector telescope of the Catalina Sky Survey, located at the summit of Mount Lemmon in the Catalina Mountains north of Tucson, Arizona — a project of NASA’S NEO Observations Program in collaboration with the University of Arizona. 2016 RB1, a small-medium sized asteroid which was large enough to survive entry into the earth's atmosphere and would have struck the earths surface in the event of a collision safely flew past Earth September 8th at 10:20am PDT (1:20pm EDT/17:20 UTC) at a reported distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers, or just less than 1/10th the distance of Earth to the moon). Because the asteroid’s orbit carried it below (or over) Earth’s south pole, it did not pass within the orbits of communication or weather satellites. 2016 RB1 was estimated to be between 25 to 50ft. (7 and 16m) in diameter.Asteroid misses Earth by 25,000 milesLarger asteroids passed close to earth in 2016 than the late discovered asteroid 2016 RB1 but were recognized earlier in their approach to earth. 2016 FN56 was larger, having a diameter between 115 and 280 feet.A cluster charge meteor penetrator peaceful nuclear explosive concept -The deflection of a late stage discovered meteor or comet would probably best be achieved via a multi-layered defense, with large peaceful nuclear explosives (PNE) being only one defensive element. While use of properly designed peaceful nuclear explosives could be a key technology, it would be wise and practical to back up this technology with orbiting hyper-velocity projectile launchers (rail gun projectors) and possibly large lasers to handle any remaining meteor fragments that stay on a collision trajectory with earth after use of planetary defense PNEs.Emplacement of a PNE under the surface of a rogue comet or meteor greatly increases the effectiveness of the explosive device as opposed to detonation on the surface.The US has put several decades into development of earth penetrating explosives (bunker busters) of various types.Some of the latest technology in the line of earth penetrators is the non-nuclear GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) which is able to penetrate 200 feet of 5,000 psi concrete. and perhaps four times that distance in soil. Larger nuclear bunker buster weapons have also been explored. During the Bush Administration there was a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) program that, if completed, would have been many times more powerful than the successful large non-nuclear MOP device.The cluster charge earth penetrator concept - After conventional kinetic penetration, multiple cumulative charges create a narrow canal, then injects into this canal explosives which upon detonation pushes the bomb deeper into the rogue body by special rocket explosions and emplaces the device in a yet deeper location. A normal shaped charge can punch a long, narrow hole; a cluster charge is capable of shifting a much larger volume of material using an array of several charges detonated near simultaneously. This cluster charge technique can blast out an impressive forty to sixty times as much rock or concrete for the same mass of explosive.A cluster charge fission-fusion device for planetary defense could be implemented so as to split a rogue asteroid into several large chunks while employing proven earth penetrator technology. The most effective way to deliver a large peaceful nuclear explosive device is to burrow and emplace under the surface of the meteor and then cleave the body of the meteor into a couple of large chunks that deflect away from the earth and end up in the Sun or are lost to space.Life has taken over 2.5 billion years to develop and evolve on earth; yet could be snuffed out in a few brief seconds in the event of a collision with a large comet or meteor.NEW SELF-PROPELLED PENETRATION BOMBby Alexander Bolonkinhttp://www.rxiv.org/pdf/1207.0013v1.pdf","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,15.0,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-could-nuclear-fusion-power-stations-be-the-answer-to-all-our-power-needs-Could-it-be-cheap-and-constantly-available-What-would-the-outcome-be

That was done by MIT.There are a number of other fusion reactor projects using a variety of different methods. These are a bit less predictable. There is a chance that one of these novel fusion reactors will work effectively and find us a cost-effective way of making fusion energy much cheaper than the ITER project and much sooner.So the main international fusion project that will replace ITER with a massive and hugely expensive reactor that may be working in another 25 years. Or the other option may be a much cheaper and novel reactor system that may produce workable power at some unknown time.There is one nuclear technology that we could develop within this decade and provide safer, cheaper and cleaner low carbon energy.A much more effective option that could give us much safer, cleaner and cheaper Generation 4 reactors. They are very different from the common fission reactors now in use around the world. Nothing like Chernobyl of Fukushima.MSR, Molten Salt Reactors have the potential to be ten times safer, cleaner and cheaper power than current PWR reactors. And they could even burn nuclear fuel waste.With enough resources, we could have some of these Next Generation, Gen 4, reactors in production within this decade.Some Gen 4 reactor designs will be able to use much of the most dangerous nuclear fuel waste as fuel. They could burn up nuclear waste and make power from it. The Terrapower project supported by Bill Gates includes an MSR, Molten Salt Reactor, and another reactor is a Wave reactor that could use depleted Uranium or unenriched Uranium or Plutonium as fuel. And there are massive amounts of depleted Uranium in storage around the world. And it is basically free to use.China is leading the world in developing Gen 4 reactors. Including a working prototype gas-cooled reactor. This is a melt-down-resistant reactor. China is also developing a prototype MSR and Wave reactor. Much of it based on US research and technology.The US has the technology to lead the world in Generation 4 nuclear power if the resources were made available.Generation 4 nuclear power will support other low carbon energy sources.Global energy demand is growing rapidly and renewable energy is unable tp keep pace with that demand.Nuclear power supplies 50% of the world's low carbon energy. And as old reactors are retired that number will drop. China and India both have massive coal problems and are planning over 50 nuclear power stations to help replace coal. They also both have massive coal reserves. Much of the growing energy demand in South East Asia is being supplied by coal. Many countries can not afford renewable energy. Currently, there are over 200 new coal-powered power stations being built in South East Asia.We need more low carbon energy options.

23,"Today, many countries take part in fusion research to some extent, led by the European Union, the USA, Russia and Japan, with vigorous programs also underway in China, Brazil, CaToday, many countries take part in fusion research to some extent, led by the European Union, the USA, Russia and Japan, with vigorous programs also underway in China, Brazil, Canada, and Korea. Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became 'big science' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Carbon Detonation Fusion permanently converts Carbon to energy and alternative elements (like non-radioactive Helium, Neon, and Oxygen gas) that do not produce any green house effect.Because during Carbon Detonation Fusion the temperature increases from the fusion, but volume is controlled by degenerate electrons and thus does not increase, plasma pressure and thus the rate of the fusion reaction can increase greatly - producing fusion's closest equivalent to fission's runaway chain reaction.By carefully controlling the amount of fusion fuel (carbon) used per shot, safe controlled bursts of fusion energy can be produced.The fusion carbon-burning process or carbon detonation fusion includes the following set of nuclear fusion reactions.The principal simple carbon burning fusion reactions are believed to be:6C12 + 6C-12 -> 10Ne-20 + 2He-4 + 4.617 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 11Na-23 + 1H-1+ 2.241 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-23 + neutron – 2.599 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-24 + γ + 13.933 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 8O-16 + 2He-4 + -0.113 MeVCarbon Detonation Fusion requires high temperatures (> 5×10^8 K or 50 keV) and high densities (> 3×10^9 kg/m3).It remains uncertain whether a Carbon Detonation Fusion will ever be used to produce controlled amounts of energy on earth.As plasma pressure increases, both the power that can be generated from a given fusion plasma and the rate of the fusion reaction in the plasma are greatly accelerated.LLNL researchers have recently demonstrated that they can achieve a pressure on a small solid sample of 5 terapascals (equivalent to 50 million atmospheres).

Stop being a bunch of whiny eco-freaks and remove the ban on nuclear power from that state. Build Gen 4 nuclear reactors, and no more blackouts. Your problems would be solved.The government is the other issue. You see the byproduct of Gen 2 reactors is plutonium. Which goes into our nuclear weapons arsenal.And there you go.Okay, people are saying I didn’t mention that fly ash is radioactive. Yes, it is. It’s nasty stuff. It also contains an enormous amount of heavy metals. What is uranium? A heavy metal. It is very nasty.How do I know how nasty fly ash is? This happened to my community in 2008.A nuclear reactor is not going to do that. That ash is filled with uranium, cadmium, cyanide, arsenic, lead. That is what is in the fly ash of a coal fired plant.You want to remind me about the nastiness of fly ash? The fallout that turned our sunsets red in December?

There’s no actual burning of the fuel rods used to create power.To make fuel rods, Uranium Ore is processed to make a fuel rod that’s below ‘critical mass’, which is the necessary mass to create a continuous nuclear reaction. When the rods are inserted into the reactor, there are neutron-blocking control rods that are used to regulate the reaction. When the reactor starts up, the control rods are retracted and the reaction begins. To stop the reaction, the rods are allowed to drop back into place.When the fuel rods have been spent, they are extracted from the reactor and placed into large pools of water to cool for a long time (they tend to get pretty toasty). These cooling pools are incredibly safe, as water inhibits the residual radiation given off by the rods. In fact, you could splash around the top of that pool and still be incredibly safe from the radioactive rods below.Spent Fuel Rod cooling poolThe problem afterwards becomes long-term storage. In the United States, we used to use Yucca Mountain, but there was a lot of protests stating that Yucca Mountain’s location wasn’t secure enough, meaning the spent fuel rods have been piling up. Places like Yucca Mountain are underground facilities built to accommodate thousands of tons of spent fuel rods for permanent storage. There are other facilities around the world whose purpose is identical: secure the waste in a place that can’t be accessed without a lot of deliberate work even after the facility is sealed and secured.Now, beyond the lack of emissions, you might wondering why we’d use such a material. The reason is because nuclear fuel has the highest energy density of any fuel source.Image source: XKCDYes, you’re looking at that right.

Nuclear: natures best renewable energy!What about the other radioactive materials?They are usable for the contrast dyes for contrast CT scans, contrast MRIs, treating thyroid cancer, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and other diseases.Wait… if that’s true, where do we get the stuff we use in medicine today?!?We buy it from Mexico and Russia! Those evil Russians, treating our strokes and other diseases!But wait… what if we siphoned off some of it, and made high grade plutonium anyway, wouldn’t that be bad?Well, it’s usable for RTGs — Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators. What good are those for?Well, we used to use them for pacemakers, so we didn’t have to go back and replace the batteries every few years, like we have to do with pacemakers today.Where else is it used? Well, the Voyager spacecraft. The Viking rovers. The Mariner spacecraft. Deep sea probes. There are places you want to explore, where there is no way to use wind or solar.But we do those things today! Where do we get the plutonium for that!?!We buy it from Russia!They used to have a lot of lighthouses, powered by RTGs. They would last forever, and keep ships from running aground. And they would last…. well, practically forever.Russia is in the process of dismantling these light houses, one by one these days, and replacing them with electric versions.That seems like a bad idea; if they are doing that, they must have a good reason..What is it?To sell the plutonium to the U.S., silly. We prefer to put our nuclear weaste in 50 gallon drums, and store it in man-made cave under Yucca mountain. Instead of reprocessing it.And how much was would there be left, if we did reprocess it?Thimbles full.Which we could get rid of very easily, by building a couple of breeder reactors, creating more nuclear fuel in the process, and destroying what waste we had left by turning into other elements. That could be used for nuclear medicine and more reactor fuel.So why aren’t we using more nuclear energy, and reprocessing today! It sounds great!Wait… why is #2 bad?!?Don’t be silly!

10,"To properly explain how temperature affects the operation of both power reactors and thermonuclear systems requires discussing a fair amount of physics.The principal effect that temperature has on the rate of fission (reactivity) is a phenomenon called “Doppler resonance broadening”.All commercial power reactors in the world right now are moderated thermal neutron systems. This means that the fast neutrons (~1 MeV) produced by fission are immediately slowed down by collisions with moderator atom nuclei until they have the same average kinetic energy as the temperature of the moderator (~300 C,To properly explain how temperature affects the operation of both power reactors and thermonuclear systems requires discussing a fair amount of physics.The principal effect that temperature has on the rate of fission (reactivity) is a phenomenon called “Doppler resonance broadening”.All commercial power reactors in the world right now are moderated thermal neutron systems. This means that the fast neutrons (~1 MeV) produced by fission are immediately slowed down by collisions with moderator atom nuclei until they have the same average kinetic energy as the temperature of the moderator (~300 C, ~570 K) which is about 0.05 eV (3000 m/sec).But, like the fuel and moderator atoms and molecules themselves, the thermal motion of the neutrons follows a Maxwellian energy distribution.The majority of the absorbing nuclei in the reactor core is U-238. The neutron capture cross section of U-228 at different energies looks like this:Those narrow spikes of absorption at specific energies are called resonances, and are due to quantum mechanical effects. Although the lowest energy spike starts rising around 5 eV, around 100 times higher in energy than the thermalized average, there is a small portion of the very long tail that is in this energy range, and there are also neutrons that encounter the thick forest of spikes in the fuel before they have been fully thermalized.Doppler resonance broadening is the effective increase in the width of those narrow spikes due to increasing temperature (and motion) of the uranium atoms in the fuel. This leads to increased parasitic absorption of neutrons with increasing fuel temperature, which reduces reactivity and makes the reactor stable — temperature increases from increased reactivity suppress that reactivity.There are other effects, expansion of moderator and fuel, reducing their effective density, and so forth, but the Doppler resonance absorption of U-238 is the dominant effect.For thermonuclear fusion the effective reaction rates are a combination of the fusion cross sections of the reactions at different energies, and the Maxwellian distribution of energies of the fuel nuclei. Together these factors produce these reaction rate curves:The fact that the curves actual start decreasing above a certain temperature (this can only be seen for D-T in this temperature range) is due to the two factors that affect the reaction cross sections: the quantum tunneling probability and the geometric cross section of the nuclei, it is the integrated product of these two that determine the rate.The quantum tunneling probability strictly increases with temperature. But the “size” of the nuclei is determined by the de Broglie wavelength of the nuclei (the “matter wavelength”) which decreases linearly with energy, so that the effective “area” of the nuclei decrease with the square of the energy. This effect eventually overwhelms the increasing tunneling probability.","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-fusion-reactor-be-designed-to-fuse-elements-heavier-than-hydrogen

It's enough if I simply give you the cover and not really the content.One method is based on Nuclear Thermal Power Generation. The method is similar but different. The initial idea was to use fission to achieve fusion. The new method uses a transuranic element, created by exposing a Uranium isotope (233 to 236) to hydrogen+helium at near absolute zero temperatures. Plus intense but specific magnetic fields.This “new” material although still in its testing phase, as revealed great potential to obtain a form of fusion. Where it can produce a form of plasma that it's extremely potent, energetic wise, but not requiring to achieve the extreme temperatures normally required for Fusion.Another method, that has also shown some potential, is the use of a hydrogen superfluid. Where tests have shown that maybe it might be perfect to be used with Electromagnetic Confinement. To achieve controlled nuclear fusion. The best data so far is the scale of the reactor itself and power requirements to start and maintain fusion.Fusion wise that's it. These two are the ones that I see, as the best possible closest solutions, to nuclear Fusion.I know that Lockheed Martin, Compact Fusion reactor, has been on almost every front page of this topic. But seriously. All the data they have shown, points to a working reactor, by around 2050 or 2070. Maybe! Seeing that there's no actual way to verify the data they share. Which is almost none.While the other private sector projects, that I mentioned above, may show results by 2025 to 2030, tops.So I'd say that nuclear fusion, may be closer, than most people believe it to be.But until something is actually made available, we won't know for sure.Although it's good to know that others are working on the problems.

You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions.

We have had fusion for the past 63 years.http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-detailsThe first fusion ‘super’ bomb was built and tested March 1, 1954 in the Pacific Range.This used the Jetter Cycle, a nuclear fuel cycle discovered by Ulrich Jetter in the late 40s. Fission normally takes place by the absorption of a neutron by a fissile material which causes the material to break down and release more neutrons. So, controlling neutron flux by absorption or reflecting lost neutrons back into the pile, controls the power output. That’s because materials heavier than Iron-56 release energy when they break apart.Fusion of course occurs when nuclei lighter than Iron 56 join together to create heavier materials. This is easily seen in the energy per nucleon chart of all isotopes of elements.Jetter looked carefully at the energy per nucleon data accumulated across the periodic table and noticed that Lithium-6 and to a lesser extent Beryllium and Boron, drop in energy dramatically - leaving Helium-4 to form a sort of spike that interrupts the smooth curve.Well, Jetter understood that Lithium-6 readily absorbs a neutron to form a Triton and an Alpha particle - releasing 4.8 MeV. 77.17 TJ/kg of Lithium-6! Of course you need 1/6th kg of neutrons to make that happen. However, Jetter also knew that the Triton had way more energy than needed to fuse with a Deuteron releasing another 17.6 MeV. Another 339.6 TJ/kg of D+T. When Tritium combines with Deuterium you get another Alpha aka Helium-4 and you get your neutron back.Given the way energy and momentum add, most of the energy ends up in the neutron. That can be a good thing because you can put something in that absorbs energetic neutrons and produces more less energetic neutrons - allowing a sort of fission to take place.The net reaction is Lithium-6 plus Deuterium produce 2 Helium-4 plus 22.4 MeV. The net reaction 270.2 TJ/kg of Lithium6Deuteride. a White Powder that’s 0.82 g/cc.Now, the material you put in the mix to manage the production of many low energy neutrons from a single high energy neutron determines how fast the reaction can grow.More on Jetter Cycle here.https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdfSo, if you want to make a hydrogen bomb like Castle Bravo, you need a prompt source of a lot of neutrons, which a fission device provides (the heat and pressure have nothing to do with it).Yet, by 1956 researchers had developed a fission free bomblet that they called “The Humanitarian H-Bomb” and folks began talking about nuclear pulse spaceships.

Other enthusiasts scheduled to testify before Congress about commercialising the results of Project Sherwood died in an unfortunate helicopter accident in the Pacific Range during a nuclear test. So, the testimony never took place. The Join Chiefs re-classified the data following the departure of Strauss, and the congressional committee on nuclear fusion began the hot fusion research program we have today.Lewis Strauss after his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - accused of corruption.Lewis Strauss before his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - hero who would bring us the ‘super’ bomb.The world today produces 600,000 tonnes of lithium per year and 45,000 tonnes (7.5%) is lithium-6. Lithium-6 is easily separated from Lithium-7 (which acts as a poison to the Jetter cycle).Deuterium is easily separated from heavy water, which is easily made from sea water. So, humanity can make 60,000 tonnes of Lithium-6 Deuteride at a cost of $480 million - $8 per kg. - $0.48 billion.Humanity spend $6,400 billion on coal, natural gas and crude oil each year. Another $2,000 billion per year is spent by the world’s military to secure supplies of oil.At 270.2 TJ/kg the cost of course is too cheap to meter. The reaction products are 1 kg of Helium-4 for each kg of Li6D. 60,000 tonnes produces 1.621 *10^22 Joules per year. 514.08 TW.Humanity, burning coal, natural gas, and crude oil, produces 17.6 TW of power. So, we produce 29.21x the energy we need from Lithium-6 Deuteride. So, actual cost of fuel is $16.4 million per year.Herman Kahn, futurist for RAND Corporation said of this process that Capitalism would defeat Communism because Capitalism will make all proletariats millionaires by 1990.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions.

You are catching up, mostly because only one new reactor was built between 1999 and 2020, but you are not going ahead as fast as you might think.My rough calculation is that if you build an extra 10% more reactors every 15-year cycle and retire the old reactors at 60 years, you finally catch up in the year 2170 after building 800-odd new reactors.And then there is the question of cost - assuming you can do this thing fast enough to actually get more reactors built than retired and you catch up by 2170 after 800 new reactors.If you were seriously committed and eliminatedIt doesn’t add up.Moving on to nuclear fusion power, I think (without the benefit of any special knowledge or training in fusion) thatNuclear fusion power plants will likely be about the same size as existing nuclear fission power plants. If only because balance of plant (generators, steam plant, cooling systems, etc) is already developed for that size.And what about the EU? Well, what about it? Nuclear power is fading in Europe and I don’t see nuclear fusion changing that significantly.Q: How many nuclear power plants (fission) would be necessary to provide electricity to all citizens, industries and business in the USA?

In a wQuick Notes On Apollo Fusion Inc.Introduction:On April first 2017, a Silicon Valley startup named Apollo Fusion announced its’ intention to create a fusion-fission hybrid power plant [3]. The company consists of two key people: a plasma thruster expert and an audacious internet entrepreneur. Both are pictured below [2,4]. The entrepreneur is Mike Cassidy.Mr. Cassidy is a big deal. His name alone, makes this company one to watch. Most recently, Cassidy served as an executive director, at Google. He has lead and sold off multiple companies since starting in business in early nineties [5]. In a word: he is a classic Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The man is also well connected: Tech Crunch has reported that Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google are both “super enthusiastic” about this startup [1]. The other person involved is Dr. Ben Longmier. Dr. Longmier is currently an adjunct professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan [4]. He has worked extensively, in plasma thrusters.Until April fourth 2017, I had never heard of either of these guys. They both work in different fields from traditional fusion. Whatever, we need them. The quest for fusion power needs all the help it can get.I was able to get a hold of Apollo Fusions’ patent application [7]. It was filed on September first of 2015. I would guess that Dr. Longmier spearheaded this effort - and brought Mike Cassidy in later. The companies’ approach is based on plasma thruster research. Their concept reminds me most of a virtual cathode made inside a penning trap. That idea was originally suggested by Dan Barnes, of the Los Alamos National Labs, back in 2000 [23]. In any case, the gist of it is: get a lot of electrons together and have them attract ions towards one spot. Get them moving at high enough speeds to create fusion. That sounds a lot like a polywell.Dr. Longmier is lucky to work in plasma thruster research. Indeed, they may be better understood that traditional fusion devices. Thrusters have gotten the funding, while our fusion field has languished. Your basic thruster relies on the Hall Effect. This is a well-researched topic, with it’s’ roots back into the sixties [7]. Multiple research teams have been involved in this effort, over the past five decades and Hall Thrusters have been used to circle the moon [6].A Basic Thruster:How do plasma thrusters work? They are normally tested in low pressure vacuum environment (1.3E-3 to 1.3E-6 Pascal). In the past, these thrusters sat on large satellites, but there has been a recent push into smaller, cube stats. A cube stat is a hunk of metal, 10 centimeters to a side. They represent the next generation of satellites. This change is reflected in Dr. Longmiers’ research. On paper, he is part of the University of Michigans’ Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion lab. That lab was founded in 1992 and since then, has hosted 15 or 20 big thruster experiments [9]. They were all housed inside a vast, 200 cubic meter, tank. These represent the old kind of thrusters. Dr. Longmier has pushed into smaller sizes [24]. He has focusing on cube stats. The basic mechanism of a Hall thruster is shown below [8, 6].To build a hall thruster, the first thing you need to do is set up your fields. At the center of the thruster is a ringed cavity. This is filled with both a magnetic and electric field. These fields run perpendicular, to one another. The magnetic field comes out from the center, while the electric field points out from the bottom of the cavity. The Lorentz force dictates electrons inside this cavity will mostly stay there. Once set up, you need to light your thruster. To do that, you must inject a fuel. Xenon is the most common fuel to burn. This is because it is a big fat atom that is easy to ionize. The Xenon atoms interact with the electrons and ionize. Once positive, they fly away from the positive electric field. When they leave this cavity they accelerate, pushing the satellite forward. As they fly, they suck in electrons which neutralize the beam. This makes a broad, neutral jet, pushing the satellite forward.Comparing:The biggest differences between this kind of work and traditional fusion research - is the scale of everything. For example, the magnetic fields used inside a hall thruster will only reach a few hundred guass [10]. Meanwhile, a polywell will need a field that is 80 times higher [11]. These are the kind of fundamental differences, which change everything about how you do your testing. For example, a Hall thruster could be run for several minutes, powered by batteries or the wall outlet. In stark contrast, the Lockheed fusion reactor must run off capacitors. Hence, Lockheed can only fire their machine for a few microseconds [12-14]. Another difference is the plasma temperature. Thruster plasma is tens of electronvolts, aka very cold. A typical fusor does fusion at 30,000 eletronvolts or hotter [15, 16]. That difference is stark, and it effects everything about how the plasma behaves. Finally, the fuels are very different. Xenon is easy to use. It is a noble gas, which works well in a vacuum system. Vacuum experts will tell you, you need a noble gas to push out the air in a Vacuum [26]. A fusion fuel like tritium is very different. When we worked with it at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, it was a cost, regulatory and safety hassle. If Apollo Fusion wants to burn tritium, they will need a great deal more technical staff and costs.All this being said, Dr. Longmier has a history of pushing the bounds of technology. He was part of a team that developed a 200 kilowatt rocket engine at the Ad Astra Rocket Company, in Houston [18]. As I understand it, this is an order of magnitude better than other rocket thrusters. This company is widely known in the space community, because of its’ CEO, Dr. Franklin Chang Díaz. Reaching such a high thrust means that many other plasma parameters and field strengths should rise in kind. But here is the key question: would plasmas in rockets get so good that they could start to look like fusion plasmas?The Patent:Patents are always vague. At first glance, this concept looks like: an electron jet, inside some bigger fields. At its’ core, is an electron beam. This beam runs right through the center of the machine. The idea is to get the electrons in this beam to bunch together. This, in turn, will attract the ions for fusion reactions. The patent does not mention how they plan to make this electron beam. But, they will need some solution here. If the electrons are not shoved forward with enough kick, they will be scattered by the other fields inside this machine. Fortunately, there are several off the-shelf electron beams that they can buy [19]. Once shot forward, the electrons will encounter several other fields simultaneously.Normally, I would model these fields, as I have in the past for the polywell and Lockheeds’ CFR [20, 21]. A model is very straightforward. You use excel, newtons’ equations of motions and the Lorentz force to map out how the electrons move around. If you want to get fancy, you use MATLAB or COMSOL. Regrettably, this patent gives us no hint as to the field strengths or dimensions inside this machine. The picture that they do give, is reproduced below [7].This is a very busy picture. The first thing you notice the large green field on the outside. This is supposed to be a balanced magnetic field. Ideally, this opposes the electron beam [7]. The patent promises that this magnetic should slow the electron leakage to the ring in the center. The next thing that you notice is that big red ring. That is just one big, positive voltage ring. A positive lump metal, for which the design is not finalized. The patent, in fact, covers several ring designs. The patent claims that if you pulse a voltaage on this ring, you can increase the plasma density in the electron beam by 700 fold. Where is this claim coming from? It be must from one of Dr. Longmiers’ publications.The center of that ring, is where the magic happens. This increase in beam density is suppose to pull ions in towards the center. If everything works as planned, the ions will slam together and fuse. This will generate neutrons, which will fly away and hit the walls. The patent then talks about using FLiBe, in the walls, to absorb the neutrons. FLibe is a popular molten salt which has been pushed the thorium community [22]. This would represent a fusion-fission hybrid approach.Assessment:Obviously, this patent and Apollos’ website will not reveal how far along this research is. Since the patent was filed in 2015, it is safe to say that Longmier has been looking at this problem for some years. That said, he has a full time job, so he does not have infinite time to develop the idea. This concept is similar to many other fusion devices – it looks like a tuning problem. You have several parameters that you can adjust. These include, but are not limited to: the fuel injection rate, the shape of the electrode, the vacuum pressure (1E-5 to 1E-10 torr), both the field strengths and their positions. You can also change the beam characteristics and how everything is placed in the machine. As you adjust these parameters, you toggle between affects that youCitations:1. Heater, Brian.

The fission blanket is kept subcritical so that one does not need complicated control or safety systems - at least that is the claim. Since each DT reaction will generate one or more fissions, one generates 15 or more times as much heat for each DT reaction making break even easier.Going back in time again, the joke was that if you made the fusion part of your hybrid plant vanishingly small, you would have a practical power plant.","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,2.3K,7.6K,248.6M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

A ship with ~50% fuel by mass, using fusion power, would have enough fuel to accelerate to 0.2–0.3 c, spend a few years or decades at that speed, then slow down at the far side. This is substantially better and more solvable than centuries or millenia. Note, 50% fuel by mass means fuel is half the mass of the ship, while the rest of the mass is everything else, from the ship itself, to engines, to consumables and crew.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

Only South Africa, of all nations that have built atomics since the Second World War, followed the lead of the United States and built gun-type weapons as their first devices. Plans existed to build improved weapons, with all sources I have read in agreement that these would have been “boosted fission” bombs. Secret cooperation with Israel’s very advanced nuclear weapons program was at the heart of these plans, but it is not clear if the idea was to make boosted fission gun-type bombs (possible in theory but apparently never done to date) or implosion weapons.From the paper, “Out of (South) Africa: Pretoria’s Nuclear Weapons Experience”, by USAF Lt. Col. Roy Horton:The (South African) military reportedly did play a leading role in coordinating clandestine arms and technology transfers between South Africa and Israel. This included the transfer of approximately 50 metric tons of South African yellowcake (uranium ore concentrate) in exchange for 30 grams of tritium to support AEC work on boosted fission weapons. Other exchanges of military technology and work on joint ventures reportedly included technical knowledge acquired from the cancelled Israeli ""Lavi"" fighter program to the South African Cheetah fighter and the joint Israeli-South African space program. The latter effort provided South Africa with a ballistic missile delivery capability using a modified Jericho II missile.The AEC scientists were relegated from a position of ""first to worst"" in terms of influence over the nuclear program. They resigned themselves to researching boosted fission weapon and implosion weapon designs for which there was no customer and no hope of increased funding. ARMSCOR did bring several AEC scientists over to its Advena Central Laboratories late in 1988 to support its implosion weapon research but the program was canceled before much work could be accomplished.https://fas.org/nuke/guide/rsa/nuke/ocp27.htmSouth Africa and weapons of mass destruction - WikipediaLaviThe Cheetah Was South Africa’s ‘Good Enough’ FighterAll atomic and thermonuclear detonations are the result of an overload of “fast neutrons” running into and smashing apart numerous nearby atoms that make up various fissile materials in the core of the weapons. The keys to efficiency are therefore various techniques for 1) keeping the prompt supercritical reaction (the detonation) confined for as long as possible before the bomb blows itself apart, thereby 2) increasing the numbers of neutrons striking their fissile material targets, and 3) reflecting as many escaping fast neutrons as possible back into the fissioning core in order to further augment the blast yield by prolonging and enlarging the reaction. All of this takes place in a fraction of a second.In thermonuclear bombs, the fission detonation is used to produce the enormous temperatures and X-ray emissions necessary to provoke nuclear fusion—a second “stage” in the detonation that occurs almost instantaneously with the first, or “primary” stage (the fission detonation). Additional stages can be added on to make the explosion even more powerful, though so far as is known, no one has attempted to build a weapon that utilized more than three (3) stages. According to Chuck Hansen’s extraordinary work,How Do Nuclear Weapons Work?Nuclear Weapons PrimerWhy No One Will Ever Build Another Nagasaki Type BombAre there three-stage nuclear weapons as opposed to the two-stage thermonuclear weapons?B41 nuclear bomb - WikipediaThermonuclear weapon - WikipediaDismantling the mega-nuke: America begins to take apart B53 that was 600 times more powerful than bomb that flattened HiroshimaFoam Plasma Mechanism Firing Sequence in a Thermonuclear Bomb.Diagram and Accompanying Text is Taken Verbatim From the Wikipedia Article “Thermonuclear Weapon”.Note that none of the sources above discuss Uranium-233, another fissile isotope of uranium. U-233, like plutonium, is most often produced in a reactor. It has the additional advantage of utilizing thorium-232 as its raw material, with thorium being three to four times as abundant on Earth as uranium. In recent months I have noticed the apparent disappearance from the web of articles discussing the utility of U-233 in nuclear weapons, as well as those regarding a process pioneered at Oak Ridge, TN, by Union Carbide, known as THOREX. Broadly similar to the PUREX procedure that removes impurities from reactor-produced plutonium, THOREX dates back to the 1950s and would presumably be fairly well known among nuclear chemists, physicists, engineers, weapons designers, and so on. Both the United States and the Soviet Union tested bomb designs that were powered at least in part by U-233 in the first decade and change after WWII. In addition, India is known to have used U-233 in at least one underground test detonation (the “Shakti V”) and so given that all of this is nothing new, I am at a loss as to why some information is no longer available. Note also that theLittle Boy - WikipediaThe first Manhattan Project implosion bombs utilized a series of explosive lenses that all had to be triggered simultaneously in order for the subcritical pieces of plutonium to be fired into the core so that they would detonate. It appears that at least some German nuclear weapons concepts from the Second World War likewise relied on implosion, but arrived there via shaped or hollow charge explosives rather than the more complicated lens-and-fusing system used in the US-Allied weapons. It is said in the sources I have read to date that the prototype boosted fission tactical nuclear weapons which were tested twice near Ohrdurf, Germany, in March 1945 utilized this approach. There is mention in David Irving’s bookWilliam Pellas's answer to What would’ve happened in the Second World War if National Socialist Germany had developed the Atomic Bomb first?William Pellas's answer to Why was there only two atomic bombs made?Swan (nuclear primary) - WikipediaDiagram Taken From the Wikipedia Article “Swan (Nuclear Primary)”.I have often wondered whether it might be possible to create the same or similar conditions necessary to ignite the fusion reaction in a bomb by some other means besides a fission bomb primary.

21,"After World War II, Japan fully expected that since America was so militarily dominant, Japan would fall under American tyranny and become a wholly occupied territory. They expected Americans to wantonly rape Japanese women, kill or imprison Japanese men (soldiers specifically), overturn the Japanese government, and take Japan’s natural resources for the glory of the US of A.

They expected Americans to wantonly rape Japanese women, kill or imprison Japanese men (soldiers specifically), overturn the Japanese government, and take Japan’s natural resources for the glory of the US of A. For a brief time after the war, the Japanese military was even issuing cyanide pills to young women so that they could avoid being raped and impregnated by blood-crazed American conquerors, drunk on victory.Japan was so certain her new American overlords would be violent, sex-mad hellfiends that the government actually opened state-sponsored brothels - specifically for the “recreational enjoyment” of Allied forces. It was the Occupation forces who declared brothels illegal a year later, stating it was undemocratic and unethical for a government to force women into such work.So, while America did in fact establish bases on mainland Japan and occupied the country for seven years, the Americans actually assisted Japan in drafting a new constitution, rebuilding their country, and did what Americans generally did in that era: carpet bombed Japan with a charm offensive. Though they had been at war extremely recently, the Japanese and Americans found they rather liked one another. While there were criminal offenses in the days directly after the end of the war, Japanese officials found that US military leaders were generally co-operative and the US military mandate for “regular order and discipline” weren’t just words on a page.Japan and America also quickly found a common enemy - the threat of the spread of Communism, which Japan had a strong distaste for even though Japan itself was only then beginning the transition from a divine monarchy to a form of democracy. Japan and America signed a peace treaty that meant America would provide security and military support for Japan. In return America gained a critical foothold in the Asia pacific within “striking distance“ of Korea and China. Given China and Japan’s rocky history, Japan was eager to have a powerful ally who was equally wary of Chinese dominance in the region.American GIs were also a large part of why the US has such good relations with its former enemies. Previously in history, the conquering armies would rape and pillage the conquered, or (later in history) at the very least conquer and plunder the losing territory. Americans had no interest in these things. Most just wanted to serve their tour of duty, drink a bit, perhaps enjoy a little romance, and then quickly get back to the United States. This attitude was a surprise to the Japanese who were used to more violent takeovers and occupations.(American GI’s fraternizing with their Japanese sweethearts…against orders, no less! Photo: BBC News)Some American GIs settled in and started learning about the people they had once fought against, as Americans generally do after almost every war. America had no real quarrel with Japan prior to World War II and wasn’t really interested in continuing the quarrel of WWII. Americans didn’t try to force a new religion or set of beliefs on Japan, they didn’t attempt to destroy the Japanese way of life or impose massive changes upon the average Japanese person. To the contrary, the Japanese found the Americans to be mostly curious about and interested in Japan. As a country, America in the post WWII era did not seem to hold many grudges nor was the US interested in “conquest” in its historical connotation.Freed from the need for military spending (among other factors) and bolstered by this new and unlikely alliance with their former enemies, Japan turned her focus to industrial development, leading to a then-unprecedented economic boom, called the “Japanese Economic Miracle”. The average national income doubled in just under ten years. America was instrumental in this as well, providing hundreds of millions per year in economic aid, and also through the spending and patronage of American GIs, marines, and sailors stationed in Japan. Japanese people even to this day associate Americans with increased spending and economic liquidity.During the 80s, the love affair between Japan and America soured, but only a bit. As the US hit a recession and jobs began to dry up, a sudden backlash against “Made in Japan” goods - so coveted and desirable a decade prior - grew pretty loud. Some Americans felt like their money was being used to give the Japanese an unfair advantage. American military might gave Japan a huge spending advantage when it came to research and development - since Japan didn’t have to have a military budget, they allocated the new influx of funds towards engineering and technology. This was a brief and passing phase, however, and America as a whole never truly fell out of love with Japan.As early as 1948, the US Government had turned away from the racism and paranoia of WWII and had begun to reimburse those affected by the Japanese-American Internment Camps by restoring property and funds that were illegally seized. In the late 1980s, Ronald Regan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, legislation that paid reparations to those affected, to the tune of almost $1.6 billion. Japanese-Americans suddenly had money to invest in starting businesses, which also fostered stronger relations with their home country.While the reparations went a long way, it was the inflation of the yen which really cemented Japan and America’s economic ties. The yen’s inflation led to Japan opening a number of factories in the US and employing American workers. Major Japanese companies found it was cheaper to hire and manufacture in the States than pay the inflated import costs at that time. Communities of Japanese workers and executives cropped up - particularly in Southern California. So many Japanese businesses moved to Torrance, CA over the years that people joked it was “Japan’s 48th prefecture”. So again, economic forces drove Japan and the US to deepen their bond. Americans in the US found that Japanese folks were peace loving, industrious, and deeply invested in social harmony - which (believe it or not) in the 50s, most Americans were too. While Americans were more direct and individualistic than Japanese folks, each could appreciate the approach of the other in those days. Japanese people in Japan found that for the most part Americans who visited or came to live there were curious, friendly, and respectful of Japan’s way of life, though they did try to bring some of their “American-ness” with them.(“The Prince and the Pauper”: Bruce Kaji, founder of the Japanese American National Museum, welcomes the Crown Prince of Japan to Los Angeles, CA, 1951)Lastly, Japan and the US discovered a shared love of entertainment, culture, and technology over the years: Japan became a technological powerhouse just as the US was emerging from WWII as an economic powerhouse. Companies like Sony and Nintendo (among many others) benefited greatly from America’s post war economic boom - as Americans had time on their hands and money to spend, and Japan had the technological prowess to create luxury goods like the NES and the Walkman. A lot of middle-class “80s kids” think of Japan quite fondly - the NES was in almost every household, many kids had a Sony Walkman, and Japanese animation and video games were taking the country by storm all through the early to mid 80s.Japan provided the entertainment and leisure products that America could afford to enjoy, and the cross-pollination between the two countries continues to this day. While Japan and America have a complicated relationship, the goodwill between the two countries seems stronger than ever with no signs of diminishing.","91,387 followers",Roland Bartetzko,569,3.4K,313.4M,21.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

The high-level waste that usually gets media attention is in the form of solid fuel pellets inside zirconium rods, which after cooling for five years can be loaded into concrete and steel containers for transport or storage.If transported to any of the proposed storage or disposal sites in the arid southwest, there is essentially zero chance of it ever migrating into the environment. Compare that to the tons of toxic (and some radioactive) particulates and carbon dioxide that fossil plants discharge into our air, and it is clear nuclear fission is millions of times “greener” than fossil plants.The only real problem with high-level waste is the government's inability to meet its commitments for handling it. This flows from the widespread ignorance among the general public about radiation in general and the tendency of politicians to prey on that ignorance for short-term gain.Although fusion power plants would likely be cleaner than the old fission plants, we should not be reluctant to deploy what is already a million times better than what it would replace. Many of the new fission plant designs produce less (or no) high-level waste. Some are capable of burning the existing high-level waste for fuel. Many of the smaller new designs feature “inherent safety,” in that the meltdown scenario is not just unlikely, it is physically impossible.– Dwight B.Hi, Dwight, and thanks for sending in your note. Energy production is one of our favorite topics atAs a reminder for new readers, nuclearOf course, this has trade-offs. Fission creates nuclear waste that can poison our environment if it’s not properly stored. And many people associate this technology with high-profile nuclear meltdowns from fission reactors.In fact, I was living and working in Tokyo during the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima back in 2011. I sent my family to the southern part of Japan to be safe while I guided my company through the crisis.I had radiation meters in my office so that my team could understand that they were safe, and the radiation hadn’t spread to Tokyo. There were, however, periods when there was the risk of radiation clouds depending on the weather and winds, and when that happened we needed to stay inside.This was an unbelievable experience to have gone through. It was one that I could have never imagined. And it was all avoidable.There were terrible management failures on the part of the power company in Japan. This resulted in the reactors not being safely shut down in advance. And there were faults in the plant design that also could have been addressed sooner to prevent the meltdowns.So some people might be surprised to hear that I am not at all against nuclear fission. I believe nuclear fission is one of the few technologies that could get the world off fossil fuels, reduce carbon emissions, and provide baseload power for our electrical grids 24/7.In fact, third-generationfission reactor technology has been around since the ’90s. These designs are far safer and even more efficient than the reactors the U.S. currently has online. Yet these third-generationreactors are mainly being built in India and China, not here in the U.S.And fourth-generation fission reactor designs are even more economical and safer than third-generationreactors. Technologies like sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs), gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs), very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), pebble bed reactors, and molten salt reactors (MSRs) all show great promise.Nuclear fission technology is based on mature technology and releases no CO2 into the atmosphere. So why isn’t the entire Western world building third- and fourth-generation nuclear fission reactors?The answer is politics.Ignorance and negative emotions around nuclear fission technology are very real, even if these reactions aren’t based on logic. The media coverage and popular sentiment against fission technology tend to be visceral despite the technological advances.Yet those same people think that they are doing something good for the environment when they drive their electric vehicle that is fueled by electricity that comes from natural gas (carbon). It is completely absurd.Due to the “bad politics” of fission, I don’t believe that we will ever get the approvals to upgrade our infrastructure with modern, safe fission technology. This deeply saddens me because we have had a clean and carbon-free solution available for decades and we haven’t used it.We could have literally been at a stage of zero carbon emissions today had we simply adopted third-generationnuclear fission technology. And you are correct – there are safe ways to store the waste that is produced. There are even ways to use or recycle that waste in existing reactors.Fusion, on the other hand, is an easier sell to society. After all, it’s the power of the Sun. It is harder to argue against that. It’s the combination of two separate nuclei to form a new nucleus. In that process, huge amounts of energy are released. That’s why I’veMy favorite approach uses a proton-boron (pB-11) fuel. The advantage of using pB-11 is that the reaction produces no neutrons. The output is just three helium nuclei and a whole lot of clean energy. No radioactive waste at all.These advanced reactors are immensely complex. Yet with our advancements in materials science and artificial intelligence, we will be able to optimize the reaction for the best energy output.This will change the political debate entirely and put the world on a path to clean energy. And I can’t wait to see it happen. That’s why I’ll continue covering developments in this space as we head toward a world of completely clean energy - Jeff Brown.But he believes fission is doomed, anyway, asThe biggest nuclear fusion deal to date…Vancouver-based General Fusion just announced a major deal with the U.K.’s Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Per the partnership, General Fusion will build and operate a nuclear fusion reactor on the UKAEA’s Culham Campus.This is one of the most exciting developments in the industry to date. And General Fusion is one of the most promising companies in this space. I’ll explain why in a minute.But first, let’s bring newer readers up to speed on fusion technology.Nuclear fusion involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean. Unlike nuclearAnd there are different technological approaches to building nuclear fusion reactors. We don’t yet know if there will be one predominant way, but I’m excited that the industry is developing so many different approaches.General Fusion’s approach is called Magnetized Target Fusion. It entails generating a plasma reaction in a spherical reactor at extremely hot temperatures – temperatures that are hotter than the Sun.The reactors can be developed in a way so that they are compact. And they don’t take immense amounts of space and money to build. We can think of these compact reactors as being powerful enough to feed 100,000 homes.This would allow us to build a decentralized network of fusion reactors. That would in turn create an energy grid that is far more resilient than the more centralized power grid that is typical of what we see today.Of course, that’s if the technology can be deployed economically at scale.That’s why General Fusion’s deal with the UKAEA is so important. It will enable the company to build a reactor, get it up and running, and then assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs.If so, all that’s left to do is build more reactors. General Fusion would have no problem securing the funding it needs once its technology has been proven.In fact, the company already has an impressive list of backers, which includes Jeff Bezos – and yours truly. And I even got in at a better price than Bezos on this one.And perhaps most exciting, this deal is moving at an accelerated timeline. General Fusion will start building its reactor next year.From there, the company expects to have the reactor operational within three years. It should be fully functional by 2025.As we’ve discussed before,We are no more than a few years away from the first fusion reactors producing more energy than that required to power them. That means limitless, clean, and essentially “free” energy for all.","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-convert-nuclear-to-hydrogen-production-See-https-www-energy-gov-ne-articles-could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear-The-UKs-Hinkley-point-nuke-could-well-pioneer-this-technology-The-electricity-wont-be-needed-by

This suffers from several problems: at best you can harvest 50% of the power, and at best the exhaust is going perhaps 1% of light speed. For example, a Krypton atom with 120 MeV would have a (non relativistic corrected) velocity of 16 million m/s, or about 5% light speed.An Ion engine can send ions out at several tens of thousands of eV. The highest speed we could make would be in the hundreds of millions of eV, literally relativistic, and at those speeds, the craft could reach a significant percentage of light speed. Of course, that requires a lot of energy, and a way to concentrate it.The highest velocity we can conceive of getting would be done by using a nuclear power plant and a high energy particle accelerator. The highest velocity we could get would be by using the waste stream of a nuclear reactor, with the lightest fraction (the electrons) accelerated using all the energy it can provide. Since the ultimate heat sink is 3 K space, the power conversion efficiency can approach 100%; since an electron is very light, they will approach light speed (the non relativistic corrected velocity of an electron at 200 MeV would be over 8 billion m/s).

On average, each Fission of an atom releases 2 neutrons or from time to time 3 as well. And this means the process is exponential, if this continues uninterrupted the end case is a nuclear explosion. If, however, the reactor has a material which absorbs some extra neutrons, in a controlled environment. It does so with moderators and control rods which respectively slow down the speed of neutrons and absorb extra neutrons. This process of fission generates energy in the form of heat. The heat could be used to evaporate water and generate steam. The steam would then be used to turn a turbine. This turbine generates electricity. Generally the enrichment for a power reactor is commonly in the 3–5% range. Beyond that the fuel gets much more expensive to produce.One of the oldest designs still in use today is the RBMK. The reactor is graphite moderated and uses water as a coolant. The reactor has a positive void coefficient, which means its reactivity/the number of neutrons produced increases if unmaintained. If the void coefficient in a reactor is 0, it tends towards stability. The reactivity of nuclear reactors change as the void (eg - steam bubbles/effervescence) is created in the coolant and moderator. Other designs include LWR (Light Water Reactors) and PWR (Pressurised Water reactors) which uses water both as a coolant and a moderator. Generally, Generation 1 reactors are slowly being phased out and replaced with newer models. But we’re still waiting for the Gen 4 reactors to be realized and for greater innovation in the field.Many advances in nuclear physics have created designs such as Liquid Fluoride Thorium reactors (However still theoretical as far as i’m aware). These designs are innovative and bypass many of the problems which earlier designs had. Almost all nuclear reactors today utilise Uranium or Plutonium. The reasons for these are multitude, including the fact that manipulating Uranium for energy is far easier than other radioactive materials.A bit of a tangent but interestingly, the possibility of using Nuclear fission for power was once thought impossible. During the 1920s and 30s, science fiction had began to speculate about this “unlimited source of nuclear energy”. However scientists such as Schrodinger, Einstein, and Rutherford claimed it was impossible. Why was this the case? The problem was the Rutherford effect, if we wished for fission to occur, we need to cause a reaction in which the splitting of any single Uranium atom triggers the splitting of many others. This was thought impossible because neutrons had not been discovered yet. And the belief was that positively charged protons would scatter from the original source, i.e., away from any nuclei, because the nuclei had the same charge as the proton (Coulomb's reaction).This is Rutherford scattering, simply put. In 1920 Rutherford suggested a flaw in his model. Protons wouldn't combine with each other to form a nuclei higher than an atomic number of 1, hydrogen. This is because of Coulomb's law (protons repel each other). This is why him and many scientists were suggesting another atomic model to explain and update their current models to a new discovery, yet to come. The discovery of the neutron changed this, it had a neutral charge. Hence it would not be repelled when coming in contact with the nuclei of atoms. This discovery eventually led to the nuclear reactor.",1 follower,Daniel Weaver,2.5K,840,1.9M,9.0,https://www.quora.com/If-nuclear-fission-is-one-of-the-biggest-man-made-explosions-and-energy-would-it-mean-its-a-method-to-thrust-something-at-the-fastest-speed
10,"No. Not even a little bit. Where did you hear that it was?Nuclear fission is due to the strong nuclear force. It has to do with the binding energy in the nuclei of atoms, and how some of that energy is released when a heavy atom splits into multiple smaller atoms. The released energy can be in multiple forms - gamma rays and the kinetic motion of high-speed subatomic particles mostly - but it all turns into heat eventually.","51,641 followers",Chris Ebbert,1.1K,11.4K,277.7M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/If-nuclear-fission-is-one-of-the-biggest-man-made-explosions-and-energy-would-it-mean-its-a-method-to-thrust-something-at-the-fastest-speed

Although researchers suggest that plasma motion and stability can be maintained for many hours after the initiating voltage sweep, there is a significant availability difference between long-pulse operations and a truly continuous operation.Much consideration has been given to the challenge of continuous operation of tokamaks. One approach to producing continuous fusion power could involve multiple tokamaks in a single power station. A future electrical utility that uses nuclear fusion might build two long pulsed tokamaks operating out of phase with each other to produce steam to drive a single turbogenerator set for continuous electricity production.D-D fusion produces with equal probability, either the light helium isotope with two protons and a neutron (He3) or the heaviest hydrogen isotope, tritium (T) with one proton and tow neutrons. Both reactions release energy, generally measured in millions of electron volts (MeV).D + D —> He3 + n + 3.2 MeVD + D —> T + p + 4.0 MeVThese reaction products can themselves react with deuterium and will either be “burned” in place or collected and burned in specialized reactors.D + T —> He4 + n + 17.6 MeVD + He3 —> He4 + p + 18.3 MeVBecause the fuel for the last two reactions is generated in the ﬁrst two, only deuterium needs be supplied externally. The ﬁnal reaction products — ordinary helium and hydrogen — are benign, but the energetic neutrons produced can damage and induce radioactivity (neutron activate) the structure of the reactor.The deuterium in a cubic meter of seawater contains the same amount of energy as 269 metric tons coal.Of all nuclear fuels, either fission or fusion, the fusion of pure Deuterium separated from sea water yields the highest energy per given mass.Energy Content Approximations for Nuclear Fuels",458 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-convert-nuclear-to-hydrogen-production-See-https-www-energy-gov-ne-articles-could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear-The-UKs-Hinkley-point-nuke-could-well-pioneer-this-technology-The-electricity-wont-be-needed-by

LLNL has made substantial progress in reducing optical damageUnderstanding Optics Damage from Reflected Laser LightLLNL has become more skillful at finding and repairing or changing out damaged optics at NIFNational Ignition Facility tops 400 shots in FY16Recently LLNL delivered a more advanced fast pulse laser called HAPLS to the ELI Beamlines Prague facility that greatly reduces the chance of damage to the active media while significantly increasing laser power to petawatt power levels.Lawrence Livermore-developed petawatt laser system installed at ELI BeamlinesNIF is and R&D research facility - first of kind ICF fusion technology. NIF is not a fusion power plant prototype. The problems that have surfaced at NIF are engineering issues that have good solutions. There are no ""show stopper"" issues with ICF that have surfaced so far.Fast pulse laser driver technology is getting simultaneously more reliable, cheaper, and higher power.The peak power attainable in a laser pulse has increased by roughly a factor of 1,000 every 10 years.High-power Lasers By Todd Ditmirehttps://www.americanscientist.org/article/high-power-lasershttps://www.americanscientist.org/article/high-power-lasersICF fusion faces geopolitical obstacles, because icf and fusion bombs are relatedHistorically, virtually every nuclear application can be traced back to a military project. A military origin should not stop sound peaceful application of fusion in a power generation context.The opportunity to use and develop ICF fusion is actually a protected right for all nations under international Treaty.In the Non Proliteration Treaty Article 5 each party to this treaty is guaranteed ""any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions"" on a nondiscriminatory basis (United Nations 1975, Article V).The corresponding article reads:NPT Article V""Each Party to this Treaty undertakes to take appro-priate measures to ensure that, in accordance withthis Treaty, under appropriate international observa-tion and through appropriate international proce-dures, potential benefits from any peaceful applica-tions of nuclear explosions will be made available tonon-nuclear-weapon States Party to this Treaty on anondiscriminatory basis and that the charge to suchParties for the explosive devices used will be as lowas possible and exclude any charge for research anddevelopment.

Negotiations on this subject shall com-mence as soon as possible after the Treaty enters intoforce. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treatyso desiring may also obtain such benefits pursuant tobilateral agreements.""USPractical ICF Fusion is the only fusion reactor concept that has been successfully experimentally field tested (as components) and has been shown to make net energy today. Practical ICF Fusion Reactor uses a succession of small controlled nuclear bursts or explosions to produce commercially significant amounts of energy (Gigawatts level) reliably from fusion.Government leaders tend to reflect a perceived public preference for energy systems that promise to deliver smooth power instead of power produced in short controlled bursts. Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s on a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.) over the decades that have never once produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds), in part because MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power. Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion, on the other hand, produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare to some extent the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote any funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Further Predictions for fusion regarding commercial power plant reliability -Creating and maintaining fusion conditions in plasma will be difficult for the first several decades of commercial MCF fusion. Complex MCF power plants that have extreme materials issues and place high temperature components adjacent to cryogenically cooled components will break down at high frequency leading to power plant unreliability.ICF fusion power plants, on the other hand, only need to maintain fusion conditions for about 10 nanoseconds on each shot. This is essentially an easier technical challenge than creating and then maintaining fusion conditions indefinately.ICF fusion will succeed in greatly improving the efficiency of the laser driver (the LLNL HAPLS laser delivered to ELI Beamlines Prague uses solid state laser pumping technology instead of traditional flash lamps and that change makes the HAPLS laser about 30% efficient at converting electricity into laser light). ICF fusion target gain will also greatly improve with the introduction of two-stage ICF targets capable of fusion energy gain in excess of 300X.Picture of a 2-stage high gain energy yield DT-DD “mini-Mike” fusion deviceMCF fusion will tend to run in short irregular power generating spurts and produce unreliable power, perhaps lesss dependable than renewable wind power, when first implemented in a commercial power plant form.ICF laser fusion power plants will on the other hand produce clean reliable power from the very first generation of power plants and will demonstrate a reliability and power availability characteristic similar to or better than current Gen-III fission nuclear power plants.Fusion and the need for humility -Huge amounts of incredibly skillful creative design and innovation have been lavished on the problems involved in bringing to reality practical forms of nuclear fusion. I do not think we are currently at a point to confidently select winners. I think we should resist pressures to consolidate all efforts to producing fusion to only the two mainstream fusion approaches, While my personal background is in ICF fusion as a part of LLNL Field Test - Engineering. I do not want pretend that I am sure that the commercial fusion future belongs to ICF fusion (and not MCF, Polywell, Dense Plasma Focus, or some other dark horse fusion technology).I trust ICF because I have repeatedly been a part of LLNL technical teams that have practically demonstrated using it to reliably on demand produce fusion power.This does not however rule out the chance that some other fusion technology has a breakthrough and becomes an alternate basis for future commercial fusion power plants.No one today sees clearly enough to make a really good timeline for commercial fusion power plants coming into existence.Excessive pesimism on the near term prospects of nuclear fusion isThe fusion quest can be successfully achieved in a time frame that matters.","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,14.0,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-convert-nuclear-to-hydrogen-production-See-https-www-energy-gov-ne-articles-could-hydrogen-help-save-nuclear-The-UKs-Hinkley-point-nuke-could-well-pioneer-this-technology-The-electricity-wont-be-needed-by

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1984 - 1988) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly and produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just theoretically predicted in computer simulations).Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion is different from Magnetic Confinement Fusion and other forms of fusion as ICF fusion has beenIf fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.------While wanting to avoid excessive controversy, I would like to point out the following historical facts.Ivy-Mike fission-fusion ICF technology worked the very first time it was tried in 1952.There was no gradual trail of experimental failures on the road to ICF fission-fusion leading to a final success after many experimental tries. Historically, ICF fission-fusion worked right from the first experimental attempt (Ivy-Mike test - 1952) and produced controlled reliable release of fusion energy with energy gain right from the first experiment.Ivy-Mike ICF fission-fusion technology has historicallyFission-fusion ICF technology was the basis of the first thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal. Adapting fission-fusion technology to be pure hybrid DT-DD fusion opens up many new applications in economical power generation.Fission-fusion technology worked the first time it was tried and produced huge amounts of net energy with engineering fusion gain not only greater than one but greater than 10^5 or 100,000X (and has never failed in over 800 underground tests at the Nevada Test Site).Rather than placing our faith in scaling laws while we build ever larger and more expensive MCF fusion experiments while trying to achieve break even energy generation -Why not go back to the field and adapt proven Inertial Confinement Fusion technology to operate as pure fusion, employing a modern fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) capable of delivering in excess of 20 MJ to the fusion capsule while avoiding use of a fission primary?Why not adapt and modify working ICF fusion technology that has never failed in the field rather than sink all current fusion funding into Magnetic Confinement Fusion approaches which in hundreds of MCF fusion devices around the world and in hundreds of thousands of shots has consistently failed to even once produce break-even fusion energy?References -NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -The following document contains what Senior LLNL researcher John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE“Development of the Indirect Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain” John Lindl.

Generation power could be far cheaper and sooner.China and India have the world largest growth in energy demand. Large renewable projects are not able to keep up. India and China are planning over 50 new reactors to meet demand. India has large Thorium deposits and want to use that to fuel its new reactors.The world needs safer nuclear technology. And the US should be leading the world. The US has the technology and resources. But large coal, gas and oil companies have powerful lobby groups to stop development.Current US reactors should remain online as long as they are cost-effective and safe. Closing down working reactors is hugely wasteful. And the US needs this vital low carbon energy. But they should be replaced with Gen 4 reactors if prototypes are successful.At the moment prototypes are vital. And could be an important option for low carbon energy.PWR reactors are complicated and need huge amounts of safety features to keep them safe. That makes them very expensive.

This is a hugely efficient reaction so not a lot of water ius needed. This is the same process produced by the sun and stars. The water will be separated from oxygen and then blasted with neutron to make fuels like deuterium and tritium.While the fuel will be extremely efficient and cheap but the reactors may cost so much that they can not be built to provide the low carbon energy we need. It may be 2035 by the time a working, power production reactor could be produced.Also with these reactors, the neutron will damage the structure and components of the reactor. So expensive components may need to be replaced regularly.The plasma produced by the reactor will be more than twice as hot as the sun. So it can not be in contact with any part of the reactor. The plasma would melt any components.On the bright side a blanket of molten salt surrounding the reactor could collect the neutrons and heat energy without damaging the reactor. Also the molten salts could contain radioactive material bonded to the salt. The radioactive material, possibly nuclear waste could be broken down by the neutrons and burning them up to produce heat energy and more neutrons. So a fusion reactor could be used to destroy high-grade nuclear waste.Such a reactor with molten salt could produce both fusion and fission power. Without any risk of a meltdown. The supply of neutrons could be stopped immediately from the fusion reactor. Producing very cheap power, destroying waste and protecting the reactor from neutron damage. The molten salt could quickly be drained from the reactor to a low neutron cooling tank.But for the foreseeable future nuclear fusion reactors will be too expensive to build.For a more immediate supply of vital low carbon energy, we could produce MSR fission reactors instead. MSR reactors could be in production within 10 years. They can also be fueled by nuclear waste, mining waste and unused weapons material.MSR reactors use salt for cooling and to carry the nuclear fuel through the reactor core. Bonded to the salts. Unlike current, common PWR reactors MSRs do not need very high-pressure water, need inefficient fuel rods that could melt or expensive enriched Uranium as fuel. Molten salt reactors can work at much higher temperatures with no risk of exploding or meltdowns. If the temperature gets to hot the liquid salt and fuel is automatically drained into a low neutron cooling tank.MSR reactors could also run on Thorium as a fuel. Thorium is cheaper amd more common than Uranium. It does not need expensive and dirty enrichment producing tons of nuclear waste. The Thorium can be completely burnt up leaving much less waste. And the fissile products produced by the reactor can also be burnt up. Producing more energy. Some very useful products can be removed from the salt mix.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

This is like containing jello with rubberbands - no matter what we’ve done, the plasma has leaked out too quickly. Even with massive, superconducting magnets cooled with liquid helium.The science is that we need to make it bigger. The bigger it is the longer it will take the plasma to leak out. No great leap needed here. The problem is that ITER, the experiment that is big enough that we expect to reach break even, is going to cost at least 22 billion dollars. It is expensive keeping the coldest place in the solar system (liquid helium temperature) just a few feet from the hottest - orders of magnitude hotter than the center of the Sun.And this is for a proof of principle experiment.

The remaining reactors were automatically shut down when the earthquake causing the tsunami hit. But great lumps of uranium take time to cool down from their operating temperatures, and require active cooling measures to do so, being well insulated to prevent energy loss during normal operation.The emergency generators powering the cooling systems were disabled by the flooding, so the cores got hotter, leading to them melting. In two of the reactor buildings, the general disarray lead to hydrogen gas being generated from the water in the reactor over the next few days, which exploded, wrecking the buildings.Note that these explosions were notIn a thermonuclear or fusion reactor, deuterium and tritium are compressed in magnetic fields at high temperature until they fuse, making helium and a neutron. The neutron flies free of the reaction and is captured by lithium cladding to produce heat and more tritium. In a commercial reactor, when we have those, the heat will drive steam turbines, just like a fission reactor. The cladding is processed to extract the tritium to be used as fuel later. The helium is drawn off, and more deuterium and tritium fuel is added to keep the reaction going.Note that, unlike the fission reactor, this isAnother failure state might be if the plasma becomes dynamically unstable and collides with the walls of the vacuum chamber. This will probably cause some damage to the cladding and magnets, collapsing the magnetic field and necessitating some expensive repairs. It is unlikely to cause a breach of the reactor; the plasma only contains a few grams of fuel at any one time.If by some combination of bad design and mismanagement the reactor chamber was breached, again this would be a purely mechanical failure.

How many neutrons are required to achieve this balance is not a simple linear one, but can be simplified by treating its black-box outside appearance as giving rise to a “binding energy” within the atomic nucleus.Now, if you plot a graph of the binding energy required for each of the elements, from Z=1 to Z=92, you get a jagged curve with a roughly elongated U-shape that reaches a minimum around Z=26 (iron). This means that if you pick a big atomic nucleus (uranium for example) and split it into two smaller nuclei (barium and krypton, for example) the products need less binding energy, in total, than the inital nucleus. Similarly, if you fuse two small nuclei (two isotopes of hydrogen, for example, deuteriim and tritium) to make a bigger nucleus (helium plus nilium (a free neutron)) again you need less binding energy in the products than in the initial nuclei. The surplus energy is released in either reaction, usually manifesting itself as increased kinetic energy of one or more of the product nuclei, which can then be made to collide with a surrounding water jacket, to raise a head of steam, to turn an electricity turbine.And Einstein’s equation. Yes, that can now be considered. If you now want to plot a graph of atomic mass against atomic number (from Z=1 to Z=92) you can count up the number of protons, and the number of neutrons PLUS the amount of binding energy (where its contribution is calculated using m=E/c^2). So, that is why I said at the beginning that I consider the traditional reply to your question to get this equation into the mix in the opposite way to the one that seems intuitively meaningful (at least in my opinion).","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/What-could-stop-a-thermonuclear-reactor-from-destroying-the-planet

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/What-could-stop-a-thermonuclear-reactor-from-destroying-the-planet

The hot gas from the reactor heats up water to produce steam that turns the steam turbines, which turn the power generators to produce electricity.The reason for the cooling tower is to help to supply cooler temperature water to the steam turbine exhaust to condense the steam to water, in order to reduce back pressure. This helps to increase power output of the turbines to turn the generators.The radioactive waste from fission, especially the Kr (Krypton) and Ba (Barium) components are the most radioactive, and will remain dangerous to all living things for many thousands of years. They are currently buried around the nuclear power plants, but likely to be stored in the Yucca Mountains, NV in the future.In aDeuterium and Tritium are isotopes of hydrogen. Hydrogen has one proton, but deuterium has a neutron in addition to the proton. Tritium has two neutrons + a proton. So, when a deuterium and a tritium are fused, a helium atom is produced along with a fast neutron (14 MeV), heat and gamma radiation. This is called a D-T reaction. There are other atoms that will work too, but the conditions for a D-T reaction is less demanding than others.Below is a generic illustration of a Tokamak fusion reactor design. So far, it’s the most favored design amongst several fusion reactor designs. Tokamak means toroidal machine, and this design was originated from Russia. The purple color “donut” represents the plasma, there are many different types of magnetic coils to confine the plasma within the vacuum vessel.The heat released from the fusion reaction is not the only heat source. The fast neutrons impinge upon the lithium wall lining (blanket) of the reactor vessel will generate a great deal of heat and split some of the lithium into tritium as new fuel.Roughly, 1% of the ocean water is deuterium, so it’s sustainable for a long time. Tritium is produced from irradiating lithium (reactor lining/blanket). Tritium was also used at one time as a radioluminescent for watches and other instruments.In terms of radioactive waste, the fusion reactor core will have the highest radioactivity, but in 50-years it will become low-level activity for another 100-years; and in 500-years, it will be no more radioactive than coal ash.Since it is difficult to get a fusion reaction going, any contamination, vacuum pressure insufficiently low, variation in the magnetic fields, RF heating or neutral beam injection issues, will not initiate or quench the entire reaction immediately. That’s why there’s no chance for a runaway reaction as is in fission. Also, deuterium is metered-in with many safeguards. So, any of the tight-tolerance requirements are out by the slightest, no chance for a fusion reaction.Still not convinced of its natural inability to do self-fusion? Here’s what we had to do on the older experimental fusion reactors several generations ago using hydrogen as a stand-in for the D-T fuel to try to create the plasma conditions to enable a fusion reaction to occur. These are probably much less sophisticated than what’s being done today on the newer fusion reactors, but may not be too far off.The vacuum vessel had to be pumped-down for nearly 2-days, using turbo-molecular pumps at the last stage to make sure there are no free-floating particles left in the vacuum vessel. These are the coil systems to help to support, heat and compress the plasma to 100-million degrees C:The timing of when these coils come on and increase their field strength is critical. The TF coils come on to establish the toroidal field corridor for the plasma to be shaped like a donut. The PF coils come on to help maintain vertical and horizontal stability of the plasma. The DF coils come on to divert any impurities within the plasma space that might quench the reaction. The CF coils come on to compress the plasma to reduce the volume of the toroidal plasma to increase plasma temperature (adiabatic heating). The OH coils come on and collapses its magnetic field through the plasma in the x-y plane to generate a current in the plasma (z-direction) and create ohmic heating within the plasma. At the same time, microwave is guide-in radially to add more energy into the plasma to heat it (similar to today’s microwave oven). Also, at the same time neutral beam is firing protons without a net charge into the plasma to increase plasma temperature through particle collisions. All of these events happen in less than a second. If 100-million deg-C is not achieved within that time period, everything shuts down.So, without many dozens of critical events properly coordinated in timing and varying magnitude of intensity, a fusion reaction just won’t happen. This is also true with all other fusion mechanisms. The other one of the two popular fusion reactor design is Inertial Confinement, where many high-powered laser beams are focused on a small D-T pellet about the size of a pea. All the beams must hit the pellet at the exact same time to implode the pellet with extreme high energy to create the 100-million deg-C temperature, a minimum ion density and hold those conditions for a certain time period (usually less than a second). No runaway reaction without more pellets or coordinated beams.On the TFTR machine, they achieve Q=1 (or better); meaning they got more energy out than put in. This is not creating energy, it’s converting atoms to a lower energy state, and harvesting that extra energy during formation. It’s getting so expensive that in 1986, the nations who are working on fusion energy decided to pool their money and talents to build an international fusion reactor, and is called the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor (ITER), to be built in south of France.Member nations include: China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States.ITER will be the largest Tokamak ever built, and the goal is to demonstrate commercial feasibility with Q >= 10; meaning inputting 50 MW of heating power with 500 MW of fusion power.

Most fission reactors use ordinary, light water. That includes probably all U.S. reactors and the infamous Fukushima Daichii which others have talked about.

They rely on heavy water to better moderate the reactions, allowing neutrons released in the chain reactions to slow down enough that they will be captured by the small proportion of U-235 atoms. I'm no expert, but my understanding is that any fission reactions would quickly dissipate if regular water were used inside such a reactor. There would be no criticality, no chain reaction, and the uranium rods would just sit there mostly inert.In short, the answer is that ordinary water could not be substituted for heavy water in heavy water reactors.

It can sieve particles smaller than an atom. Acquiring the ability to separate particles smaller than an atom using a membrane at room temperature was unthinkable even to me not long ago. Such graphene filters could enable low cost production of Deuterium for a fusion ship.Graphene was discovered by Nobel laureates and professors Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at Manchester University in 2004 and has astonished the world of materials science with its range of unusual characteristics, such as its atomic-scale thinness, extreme strength and high electrical conductivity.A novel property of graphene is its ability to filter the different atomic isotopes of hydrogen, namely tritium and deuterium, from ordinary hydrogen[1].The rare form of hydrogen, deuterium, is only present in nature in very small amounts. For every 6,420 hydrogen atoms, there is just one atom of deuterium, and increasing the concentration of deuterium to produce Deuterium by conventional methods is somewhat intensive and expensive.The Manchester researchers showed that graphene can act as a simple filter by slowing down the movement of deuterium through a membrane made of graphene and its sister material, boron nitride. Ordinary hydrogen atoms passed straight through the sieve, but deuterium is effectively blocked.Mankind currently possesses impure practical Inertial Confinement Fission-Fusion (ICF) technology which could be directly employed to build fusion powered ships.DD fusion of pure Deuterium is not a practical fusion reaction for Magnetic Confinement Fusion reactors trying to reach and exceed break-even energy but is a practical fusion reaction for producing useful fusion energy with energy gain in ICF fusion reactors which operate with fusion plasma that is literally 10^11 times more dense than the plasma used in tokamak experiments like ITER.(more information)[1] -","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,9.0,https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-simple-way-of-explaining-Nuclear-Fission-and-Fusion-Power

Leaving some of the chamber open to vent off any hazardous ionized particles into outerspace.",48 followers,Ryan Murphy,11.4K,0,0,12.0,https://www.quora.com/What-could-stop-a-thermonuclear-reactor-from-destroying-the-planet

What’s stopping us from getting higher speeds in space since there’s no resistance in space?”Short answer: ThrustA typical rocket burns fuel to make thrust. Out of fuel = out of thrust = no faster will you go.There’s a neat thing called “the rocket equation” that points out if you want more thrust, you need more fuel. More fuel means more weight, and that means you won’t go much faster even with the extra fuel. This just means going faster means taking more fuel with you, and we don’t mean a little extra fuel… it takes more and more andQ: “The fastest speed achieved in space was 165,000 mph.

More fuel means more weight, and that means you won’t go much faster even with the extra fuel. This just means going faster means taking more fuel with you, and we don’t mean a little extra fuel… it takes more and more and more to go faster.So that’s rocket fuel, but there are other ways to get going faster, and the most significant is gravity. Voyager II famously got a lot of mileage out of gravity assist “slingshots” as will the new Parker Solar Probe.But maybe you want to keep accelerating. For that, you need some other source of thrust. There do exist electromagnetic thrusters which make extremely efficient use of their “fuel”. By using electrical power to provide the energy, these can accelerate their “fuel” particles to ludicrous exit velocities. These things tend to provide a very tiny amount of thrust, but they do it for a very long time. That could add up to higher final speeds than what we get with chemical rockets.Finally, to get unbounded speed, you need something with no fuel limits. (Edit: Andy below commented on my poor wording here… cleaning it up.) Theoretically, a solar sail could harness the momentum of light to provide thrust. But now we’re talking a TRULY tiny amount of thrust, and only while you’re flying away from the Sun, and only when close to it. There’s still some hope for the EM drive I guess. Presumably that would be better than a photon drive… somehow. Realistically, the solar panels are needed for infinite power, but to get decent thrust out of it, you really want a nuclear reactor.Since we’ve mentioned that light has momentum, we should mention light sails. There is talk of a plan to build a tiny light sail and hit it with a massive laser array. In that way, the energy used to accelerate it is coming from a remote source that doesn’t have to move. That would make the top speed of the craft bounded only by the amount of laser energy you could generate here… and relativity of course.Finally, I should mention project Orion. The plan with Orion was to power a spacecraft with nuclear explosions. You’d literally drop a nuke behind your rocket and set it off to give you a massive boost of thrust. The energy-to-mass ratio on a nuke is off the charts, so if you really needed to get moving fast, that’s probably how you’d have to do it.","10,085 followers",Nancy Malar,4K,678,11.6M,13.0,https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-simple-way-of-explaining-Nuclear-Fission-and-Fusion-Power

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

But they also were looking for funding.So it’s firmly ingrained in my psyche that it will never happen. But never say never. I’m into share investing and this guy Jeff Brown reckons it’s just around the corner. There are several private companies that seem to be moving fast.Here’s what he wrote. If you think he’s writing bollocks don’t blame me, I’m just reporting what he said, as it’s what’s going on right now.The biggest nuclear fusion deal to date…Vancouver-based General Fusion just announced a major deal with the U.K.’s Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Per the partnership, General Fusion will build and operate a nuclear fusion reactor on the UKAEA’s Culham Campus.This is one of the most exciting developments in the industry to date. And General Fusion is one of the most promising companies in this space. I’ll explain why in a minute.But first, let’s bring newer readers up to speed on fusion technology.Nuclear fusion involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean. Unlike nuclearAnd there are different technological approaches to building nuclear fusion reactors. We don’t yet know if there will be one predominant way, but I’m excited that the industry is developing so many different approaches.General Fusion’s approach is called Magnetized Target Fusion. It entails generating a plasma reaction in a spherical reactor at extremely hot temperatures – temperatures that are hotter than the Sun.The reactors can be developed in a way so that they are compact. And they don’t take immense amounts of space and money to build. We can think of these compact reactors as being powerful enough to feed 100,000 homes.This would allow us to build a decentralized network of fusion reactors. That would in turn create an energy grid that is far more resilient than the more centralized power grid that is typical of what we see today.Of course, that’s if the technology can be deployed economically at scale.That’s why General Fusion’s deal with the UKAEA is so important. It will enable the company to build a reactor, get it up and running, and then assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs.If so, all that’s left to do is build more reactors. General Fusion would have no problem securing the funding it needs once its technology has been proven.In fact, the company already has an impressive list of backers, which includes Jeff Bezos – and yours truly. And I even got in at a better price than Bezos on this one.And perhaps most exciting, this deal is moving at an accelerated timeline. General Fusion will start building its reactor next year.From there, the company expects to have the reactor operational within three years. It should be fully functional by 2025.As we’ve discussed before,We are no more than a few years away from the first fusion reactors producing more energy than that required to power them. That means limitless, clean, and essentially “free” energy for all.….So to your point, if we are to be objective, rational, and smart about energy production when planning for the future, we must look at the whole picture – how energy is manufactured, the dangers or complexities involved in its use, the negative environmental impacts, and how and if materials can be recycled when they have reached the end of their useful life.And these are some of the reasons I speak so highly of nuclear fusion. I truly believe it’s the future of clean energy production.Nuclear fusion (not fission) will generate truly clean energy without many of the drawbacks I listed above. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion can create energy without radioactive waste. And the fusion reactors will actually have small footprints. They just won’t take up that much space.And the good news is that we’re getting close to making it a reality.As I wroteThat’s why, within just a few years, I expect we’ll start seeing nuclear fusion becoming one of the hottest topics in the world of technology.A major milestone for nuclear fusion…On Christmas Eve, the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) fusion device in South Korea maintained a high-temperature plasma for 20 seconds. This is the longest sustained nuclear fusion reaction ever.While 20 seconds may not sound like much, it is a big deal.Back in 2018, KSTAR was only able to maintain plasma for 1.5 seconds. In 2019, it was able to get this up to eight seconds. And now it is at 20 seconds.All things being relative, KSTAR has increased the duration of its reactions by 13 times in just two years. That’s a clear sign of exponential growth.And get this – the reaction occurred at over 100 million degrees Celsius. That’s nearly seven times hotter than the Sun, which can reach 15 million degrees Celsius.As a reminder, nuclear fusion is essentially the power of the Sun. It involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean. Unlike nuclearThe hardest part of the process is maintaining plasma to sustain the reaction. That’s why KSTAR’s progress is evidence that nuclear fusion is coming much faster than anyone realizes.The experts say that we are at least 10–15 years away from being able to generate clean energy using nuclear fusion technology. But when I look at the progress KSTAR and others are making, I can confidently say they are wrong. I predict that we will have a functioning nuclear fusion reactor within the next five years.Pretty soon KSTAR will be at one minute. Then 10 minutes. Then an hour. And in time, it will be able to sustain net energy production. That’s when the reactor produces more energy than it takes to run.This will be one of the most important scientific developments to watch this year.We’ll keep a close eye on KSTAR’s progress in 2021. And I predict that at least one other nuclear fusion project will make a major breakthrough in the space this year.The race to build the world’s first nuclear fusion reactor is on…We talked about nuclear fusionNot to be confused with nuclearAnd Commonwealth Fusion Systems just released seven peer-reviewed scientific papers that reveal how its fusion reactors will work. This is the first time a private company has published its work on the science behind its own nuclear fusion technology.Here’s what Commonwealth’s reactors will look like:Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ ReactorSource: Commonwealth Fusion SystemsAs we can see, the reactors employ a spherical design, more specifically like a donut with a core in the middle. And they use superconducting magnets to control the plasma when in operation.And get this – each of these reactors could fit in a space the size of a tennis court. That means these reactors could give rise to a robust, decentralized electric grid.Rather than building one massive plant that costs tens of billions of dollars like other nuclear fusion projects have tried (for example, ITER in Europe), Commonwealth will be able to build many of these compact reactors at a fraction of that cost.And each of these reactors will be able to produce 10 times the energy it takes to run them. In other words, 10 units of energy will come out for every one unit of energy that goes in. That basically means nearly free and limitless clean energy for the planet.Commonwealth announced that it is in the process of developing the superconducting magnets right now. The company will conduct extensive testing on these magnets next year, and it plans to begin construction on its first fusion reactor before 2021 is out. That will keep the company on pace for achieving net energy production by 2025.This is such an exciting development. And it sets up a two-horse race in the industry.We have talked about TAE Technologies before. In fact, I’ve published a special research report profiling the work TAE is doing. Readers who missed that report can find itTAE is taking a different approach to nuclear fusion. And the company believes that it can achieve net energy production by 2024.I’m so excited to see not one but three private, early stage technology companies pursuing this incredible goal.The third company is General Fusion in Vancouver, Canada. Solar and wind power generation are great, and we should continue to use those technologies.But with very few exceptions, they are simply not capable of generating baseload, utility-scale energy production. And without that, we’ll never have a shot at getting the world off of carbon-based fuels.Within three years, nuclear fusion will become one of the hottest topics in the world of technology. If you’re reading this, you are already far more knowledgeable about the technology than 99.99% of the population, and I plan on keeping my readers on the bleeding edge.Limitless clean energy will be here by 2025…Commonwealth Fusion Systems recently raised $84 million in a Series A2 venture capital (VC) round. We talk about VC rounds frequently in these pages, but this one is especially noteworthy. Why?This money will be used to develop and build a nuclear fusion reactor.Not to be confused with nuclearFirst conceived in 1920 by British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, nuclear fusion is simply the energy that powers the Sun.More specifically, nuclear fusion is the combination, at very high temperatures, of two separate nuclei to form a new nucleus. In that process, huge amounts of energy are released.The Sun combines atoms of hydrogen to form helium atoms plus energy. That energy travels all the way to Earth to provide the light and heat that we need to survive. (For anybody who’d like a more detailed explanation of nuclear fusion, pleaseNuclear fusion offers limitless clean energy. And Commonwealth Fusion Systems plans to bring it to us by 2025.I met some members of the Commonwealth Fusion Systems team not too long ago at a small, private conference. The company was spun out of MIT, and it is making amazing progress. It plans to pick a site for its first nuclear fusion reactor later this year.From there, the team’s goal is to have the reactor producing “net energy production” by 2025. That term refers to the point when the reactor’s energy output exceeds the energy input needed to run the fusion reactor.More output than input is why nuclear fusion can provide unlimited clean energy. When this happens, energy costs will plummet. And equally important, carbon emissions will do the same.This Series A2 funding round will help Commonwealth Fusion complete the technical development of its reactor. I expect the company will raise more capital next year to finance the construction of the reactor itself.And it won’t have any problem raising as much money as it needs.Commonwealth Fusion Systems is backed by several big VC firms as well as two multinational energy conglomerates, Equinor and Eni. Plus, the company is backed by several divisions of the U.S. government and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.Commonwealth’s approach is a very practical and useful. It is designing a compact nuclear fusion reactor that can be used the world over for industrial settings as well as residential areas.If we think about all the problems that come with other forms of energy – geopolitical tensions surrounding oil and environmental issues from coal – nuclear fusion technology solves these problems for good.As we are only a few years away from what I predict will be the world’s first net energy-producing nuclear fusion reactor, I believe that venture funding in this space is set to rapidly increase. Fortunes are going to be made by the company, or companies, that develop nuclear fusion reactors.Ok that’s about it. He thinks nuclear fusion is 3 years away! It may well be that private enterprise speeds things up, as with Space-X.

In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power for billions (yes, with a B) of years, well beyond when the Sun runs out of hydrogen.On the other hand all of these projects are very far from being useful. See, producing more energy in plasma than what you put in via magnets is an important milestone, but the one you should be looking at is not the energy of plasma, it’s the energy you can harvest from that plasma. It’s mostly thermal energy and the conversion factor of that to electric power is usually around 1/2. So even these reactors won’t actually be producing more electric power than what they need to power them. They’d have to produce approximately twice that much just to break even.But wait, breaking even still only means you’re running the reactor without external input. You aren’t putting any energy in the grid yet at this point, all you’re doing is producing small quantities of helium. For the reactor to become commercially viable, it needs to produce energy far in excess of that and you need to account for energy needed to generate adequate deuterium and possibly tritium to run the core.That’s why even the furthest advanced fusion reactors are still very far removed from being useful as a power source. It is hoped that once we manage to produce a reactor that will put more energy out than it needed to run it, smaller incremental improvements will follow quickly and the next two steps will not need an exorbiant amount of time. Math seems to suggest we’ll be able to extract several times the energy we put in, that’s why these projects are being financed in the first place.But don’t count on fusion power plant construction starting in mid-2030s either.

Among these concerns is the possibility that the mining rig could produce lots of heat that could damage the car’s internal parts over time. The car’s battery pack could also be easily damaged when used continuously for Bitcoin mining.Despite its great potential and possibly good profits, Tesla or other electric car owners should decide carefully if they want to use this approach to mine cryptocurrencies due to its potential adverse effects on the performance of their cars.Those who want to mine digital currencies may also want to explore other approaches in mining like the use of renewable energies like solar panels.However, because they are still in the early phase of developments, these new technologies require a hefty upfront investment.

It also warned investors against speculative crypto trading.At one point on last Friday nearly $1 trillion was wiped off the market capitalization of the entire crypto sector. In early afternoon trading, their market cap was $1.6 trillion, according to data tracker coingecko.Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, had already been under pressure from a series of tweets from Tesla's Musk.Cryptocurrency price declines last week were sparked by Musk's reversal on Tesla accepting bitcoin as payment, citing the heavy environmental toll of ""mining"" bitcoin, which requires a lot of electricity to power the computers that create bitcoin.Amid Wednesday's crypto sell-off, Musk tweeted a 'diamond hands' emoji, used in social media to signal a position worth holding on to.Bitcoin has dropped some 40% from a record high of $64,895 hit on April 14.

It is as if the creators of cryptocurrencies are declaring that human nature and all of its “baggage” has no access to this territory.The modern financial system cannot boast such a feature. Instead, its money is produced by banks and is a factor of the political and economic influences of specific countries and organizations. In other words, the “old” money serves very specific interests.On the other hand, before our very eyes emerges a new, extra-governmental, extra-historical currency, claiming to become a universal, absolute equivalent, even to a point of driving gold out of its immovable position.Why did Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ultimately come about?The birth of cryptocurrency comes as a result of a new need for it ripening in today’s increasingly globalized society. Although many people criticize globalization, it is nonetheless a natural phenomenon that reflects humanity’s current state. We have become one technological and economic whole, but we still reject our state of oneness psychologically.That is why we still do not know how to use and integrate cryptocurrencies systematically into the mainstream. Yet it still does not change its essence: that the global world is demanding a global monetary equivalent independent of local, subjective “circumstances” and interests.The overblown human ego on a global scale is gradually building respective global systems for itself in a way that makes no artificial ideological attachments. There is no “good” or “evil” here, but only business in its purest form. Also, what difference does it make if the reciprocal trust of the parties is provided by virtual computer computations? On the contrary, it makes it even better; there will be fewer errors in the calculations. It turns out that we are talking about global trends and, for the most part, it makes no sense to resist them.In the future, we will develop more universal parameters, but of a social nature. The day will come when, by virtue of a new quality of interconnection between us, a new “currency” will emerge—social rating—expressed by a clear equivalent that anyone can understand.People will be able to accumulate it as well, but not sell or buy it. It is more likely to have a comparative nature while having completely real value. It is because society, especially a global one, cannot be based on just bare egoism alone. Of course, it is rational in its own way, but when left to its own devices, it leads to a dead end. Our social aspect must take the upper hand over self-focus so that the whole will not fall apart into pieces.

Th232 is a fertile material than can be made into fissionable U233 again through neutron absorption in a breeder type reactor. Thorium is more abundant than Uranium, and therefore more easily obtained. Nobelist Carlos Rubbia proposed a subcritical energy amplifier that consisted of a Thorium Core reactor that used a particle accelerator as a neutron source to create a safe reliable reactor.Hydrogen bombs use a compounding of Lithium-6 isotope, about 7.5% of natural Lithium, and Deuterium istope about 0.03% of natural hydrogen. Put these together and bombard them with neutrons and you get 270.15 Trillion Joules per kg of the stuff, which is far more than 82 TJ/kg of other materials. The other thing about this is you don’t have long lived actinide series products.Lithium-6 with a neutron source like Polonium or Pu238 source of alpha particles illuminating Beryllium foil, or a particle accelerator that makes neutrons on demand, yield 77.2 TJ/kg on demand in a subcritical reactor. This is relatively clean process producing helium and tritium. The tritium yields 1.061 kW/kg of radioisotpe output over a 12.32 year half life. The tritium emits an electron and turns into Helium-3 which is another fusion source.Since there is not a large amount of fusion fuel inside current fusion reactor designs, there is no way for fusion reactors to melt down. In fact, in a properly designed fission reactors, there is no way for them to melt down either.For example, in the ROVER and NERVA nuclear rocket reactor, the engine contained a subcritical amount of fissile material that was covered with a neutron reflecting blanket. That blanket was built like louvers in a window that varied the number of neutrons that could be reflected. When the louvers are closed the neutron flux was very high. When louvers are open, neutron flux is below break even. In a run away event, the louvers automatically open, stopping the reaction. Should that break down, the journal bearing holding the louvers in place melt first causing them to fall off, leaving the subcritical mass naked, and it quickly cools down.Subcritical Energy Amplifiers work the same way by introducing a neutron flux to a reactive energy multiplying element.Inertial confinement fusion reactors detonate small pellets of fusion fuel to pro...","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,677,47.3K,779.4M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-case-scenario-in-a-meltdown-of-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-knowing-that-its-temperature-can-be-up-to-70-million-degrees-centigrade-which-is-over-5-times-hotter-than-the-Sun

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1984 - 1988) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly and produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just theoretically predicted in computer simulations).Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion is different from Magnetic Confinement Fusion and other forms of fusion as ICF fusion has been **PROVEN** experimentally to work.If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.------While wanting to avoid excessive controversy, I would like to point out the following historical facts.**Ivy-Mike fission-fusion ICF technology worked the very first time it was tried in 1952.**There was no gradual trail of experimental failures on the road to ICF fission-fusion leading to a final success after many experimental tries. Historically, ICF fission-fusion worked right from the first experimental attempt (Ivy-Mike test - 1952) and produced controlled reliable release of fusion energy with energy gain right from the first experiment.Ivy-Mike ICF fission-fusion technology has historically **never failed** to work while producing fusion energy with enormous energy gain.Fission-fusion ICF technology was the basis of the first thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal. Adapting fission-fusion technology to be pure hybrid DT-DD fusion opens up many new applications in economical power generation.Fission-fusion technology worked the first time it was tried and produced huge amounts of net energy with engineering fusion gain not only greater than one but greater than 10^5 or 100,000X (and has never failed in over 800 underground tests at the Nevada Test Site).Rather than placing our faith in scaling laws while we build ever larger and more expensive MCF fusion experiments while trying to achieve break even energy generation -Why not go back to the field and adapt proven Inertial Confinement Fusion technology to operate as pure fusion, employing a modern fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) capable of delivering in excess of 20 MJ to the fusion capsule while avoiding use of a fission primary?Why not adapt and modify working ICF fusion technology that has never failed in the field rather than sink all current fusion funding into Magnetic Confinement Fusion approaches which in hundreds of MCF fusion devices around the world and in hundreds of thousands of shots has consistently failed to even once produce break-even fusion energy?References -NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests - Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists (The following document contains what Senior LLNL researcher John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE“Development of the Indirect Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain” John Lindl.

As you make the chunk larger, the amount that react goes up faster than the amount that leave, so when you get to a certain size, around 7 kilograms for plutonium, 50kg for U235, the reaction can run on its own.   Those are the minimum amounts of fissile material you can get to react by themselves.  You can cut this amount down by a factor of eight or so by special tricks, like compressing the heck out of the material and surrounding it with lots of reflexive material, but that's impractical for anything other than a bomb.So a small nuclear reactor, not possible.   The smallest one I know of is the one that was put in an airplane, and that one was still like 20 tons, and it only had minimal shielding, on the side towards the cockpit.   On all the other sides, it was emitting 30,000 rads per second, fatal to anything within a mile or two.   The radiation was so high, that just the forward scattering into the air in front of the cockpit required a windshield that was 10 inches thick.The smallest bomb we know of was the ""Davy Crockett"" backpack munition, about 25 kilos.  Again, not practical for powering anything.Well there is another possibility, you can take nuclear waste and refine out some short-lived isotopes which have fantastic amounts of radioactivity, so they naturally get like orange-hot-- you can use the heat to heat up some thermocouples and that will generate SMALL amounts of electricity.  That's the power source for like interstellar probes like Voyager.    But those are not very practical, the radioactivity is just insane.   If you smashed the phone they'd have to evacuate a few square miles.  And the USA and USSR at least have stopped refining nuclear waste so the stuff just isn't available anymore.

So if the reactor produces 3 kW, the car would be limited to a 9mph top speed!However, if the car still had a decent battery pack, the nuclear reactor could recharge it overnight by about 90 miles in 10 hours - which is enough for most people’s commute.Failing that - fitting 10 bowling balls into the trunk of the car would get you a 90mph car without needing batteries…and the reactors would last longer than the car itself, so it would never need refueling or recharging.[[UPDATE]] :But it would take 7 tonnes of fuel rods (which are insanely radioactive) to get enough Americium for ONE of those reactors.

These reactors are highly resistant or immune to meltdowns. Mainly by using inbuilt features that can work automatically with the need for human intervention. No AI or internet needed but they could be added. The next step in Generation 4 reactors is the need to build prototypes to prove their safety and capabilities.China has just started operation of a new gas-cooled pebble bed reactor the uses heat resistant spheres that contain fuel. Able to operate at much higher temperatures without melting. And air cooling systems that do not need power or pumps to keep the temperatures down. This system does not need to be shut down for refueling. The fuel spheres are regularly removed, tested, returned or replaced. They will have a much longer lifespan than fuel rods so they will be able to burn fuel more efficiently producing much less waste.China is also building an MSR, Molten Salt Reactor, reactor and possible a Sodium Cooled Traveling Wave Reactor. The MSR system is highly efficient and burns up most of the nuclear material leaving very little waste. It has the fuel mixed with the salt and it can be quickly removed at any time from the reactor to a safe cooling tank. This will be done automatically if needed without human intervention and no need for power or pumps. Some of the fuel mix can regularly be removed or placed into the reactor with any shutdown. The liquid mix allows for easy refueling or removal of valuable and useful nuclear products. For materials used in science, industry, space or medical uses.The Sodium colled Travelling Wave Reactor, TWR, uses a slow-burning fuel system that lasts for years. It uses depleted Uranium waste for fuel that is abundant and cheap and held in large stockpiles so no mining would be needed. The depleted Uranium comes from the Uranium enrichment commonly used in PWR reactors. This system is mostly self managing and is very easy to operate.Many of these reactors can be small or modular. So they can be easily transported to where they are needed. They could be built in factories for efficient and cheaper production and rapid construction. They are easier to operate with less staff. They can use nuclear and mining waste as fuel and even burn up nuclear weapons-grade material reducing proliferation risks.Efficient burning of the fuel produces much less waste and leaves less material for weapons use. The MSRs can use Thorium as fuel which is a byproduct of rare earth mining. Making it very cheap. It is also easy to handle and does not need expensive or dirty enrichment. Thorium is 3 times more abundant than Uranium and all of it can be used as fuel.The ideal solution for nuclear energy is Fusion. As used in the sun. But it may take decades A Chinesetest reactor has produced plasma at 2 times the heat of the sun for 100 seconds. A world record. The very large international ITER reactor being build in France may be operational by 2025. But these costs over $10 billion so actual power-producing fusion reactors may be far too expensive. If at all possible. But the safety risks would be minimal with no long term nuclear waste. And the fuel can be produced for free from water.So for vital low carbon energy Generation 4 fission reactors remain a faster option for cheap, low carbon energy. The efficiency of Gen 4 reactors could compete with gas. Having no risk of meltdowns, steam explosions or hydrogen explosions these reactors could use very much cheaper and smaller containment buildings. Or could be placed underground for security.These reactors are in development in many countries but lack support. So China has been able to take the lead in development. Some reactors using US research and technology. US production of prototypes has not yet started but they are gaining vital political support. The US-built successful MSR prototypes in the past but the programs canceled for political reasons. Along with anti-nuclear activists, there are strong oil, gas and coal lobby groups with long, historic connections and rich backers.There are some very good reasons to develop Gen 4 prototype reactors. Despite all the arguments by anti-nuclear groups that oppose all nuclear power. Many new nuclear reactors are already planned for future construction in a number of countries. This can not be stopped by anti-nuclear groups. But better and safer reactors with low carbon power would be a better option. China and India alone are planning to build over 50 nuclear reactors. They are building many different types of reactors so they can decide and use whichever are best.Other arguments are that they cost too much to develop and take to long to be of any use. Both of these arguments fail to recognize the need for low carbon energy options and the resources we have to develop and build these reactors. Solar and wind power will not replace fossil fuels within the next 20 years. And with the costs of global warming, the cost of developing Gen 4 nuclear is cheap. A number of prototype reactors could be built for less than the cost of an aircraft carrier. Production reactors would be much cheaper than current PWR reactorsCheap in terms of military spending as well. And global warming will be a significant global security risk. If global warming theories prove to be accurate. Either way, Gen 4 technology can be timely, at reasonable cost and effective. Most of the technology exists, the industrial capacity exists, the reactors will be cheaper and faster to build. And they will cut down on other pollution problems. Including reduction of high-grade nuclear waste. Production reactors could be ready in 10 years. And the costs of Gen 4 power will be competitive with coal and gas.They are building US, Russian, European and Canadian reactors as well as indigenous ones. Gen 4 reactors will be an option if the prototypes are built, tested and their capabilities proven. Generation 4 reactors will also be needed to replace older reactors that are reaching the end of their economic lives.Currently, there are many Gen 4 designs that could be built as prototypes before production power reactors can be built. In the US it is very hard to build Gen 4 reactor prototypes without significant government support. Many small US companies are developing the technologies. Fusion technology also. It would be nice to see other countries building prototypes.AI can play a role in future but the current need is for production of prototype Gen 4 reactors to provide safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,625,47.3K,779.4M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

In most commonly know methods many times during the fusion process besides the fast moving neutrons that it loses, the flow of plasma isn't always the same. Some times the plasma takes on some erratic shapes that simply force the reactor to stop.So bottom line is this…We still don't have the right kind of fuel that does not produce fast moving neutrons. I mean, we do know of a fuel but seeing there's almost none here on Earth but tons of it on the Moon, it is still cost prohibitive to do such an endeavor. At least until oil runs out and then we'll really have to get a move on.As for the inconsistencies in the plasma flow. That's been gradually been fixed thanks to the data we have already collected and the information obtained by simulations run on supercomputers.So the real problem seems to be fuel.Or maybe… There is actually no problem at all.Here… Let me present to you. Jetter Cycle Fusion! It will be a bit long so bear with me.So what is the Jetter cycle…Adding lithium 6 to an electrostatic confinement fusor that contains deuterium should result in a more practical system of energy production. Though none have been reported as yet.Li-6 is easily separated from Li-7. If you have a Lithium mine you could sell the Lithium 7 and keep the Lithium 6.Then manufacture a Farnsworth Hirsch fusor with a Lithium Tungsten lining.Since selling enriched Lithium is illegal you sell the power and keep the hardware. Or better yet use the power to make fuel and sell that.If you could make lots of cheap fission free hydrogen bombs out of Lithium 6 and deuterium say 0.33 kilotons each. That's 1.395 trillion joules. And detonated them off in a nozzle that directed the plasma plume we’d have a rocket! Put two rockets pointing in opposite directions blowing up bombs 1/60 th of a second apart each operating at precisely 30x per second and let the plasma stream flow through a MHD generator for each exhaust plume and switch the two generators we would have a 60 Hz AC generator producing 83.68 terawatts of power!Humanity today uses only 17 terawatts of power burning stuff that died long time ago. So the generator just described provides 5x the power of the whole planet. Since each watt allows people to create $6 per year of income done cheaply this generator ends air pollution and generates enough power to support a $502 trillion per year economy. $68,000 per person per year. A family of four earns $272,000 per year.Monaco levels of Wealth! At 16,000 people per km2 the same as Monaco very little of the Earth is used. 100% recycling by mixing in garbage around the bomblet and separating out various elements from the plume with magnetic deflection.Now at 270.1 trillion joules per kilogram of Lithium 6 deuteride we need only 5.16 grams per bomblet. At 0.6 kg/l this occupies 8.6 ml. About the size of two teaspoons.Shot out of a Gatling gun into the nozzle at 30 times per second each phased a 60th of a second apart. The two guns are synchronised and each charge has a detonator that senses the magnetic field of the power circuit to get the timing just right.This that I have described to you is all technology developed in the 50’s.At $0.03 per kWh and 1.395 terajoules per unit you could spend over $12,430 per bomblet and spend less for energy than you do for coal.At 60 detonations per second the generator uses 310 grams per second to power the generator imagined. 232 grams per second of Li6 and 78 grams/sec Deuterium!Deuterium is extracted by processing 2.23 litres per second of sea water and isotopically separating 3.06 kg per second of naturally occurring Lithium metal.That's 70.67 million litres of sea water per year and 96,700 tons of raw Lithium per year. 16% of today's 600,000 ton per year production.University of Michigan and Ford estimated that we know of 39 million tons of Lithium can be recovered. Enough to operate this generator for 403 years.The Lithium content of sea water is 230 billion tons. Enough to power the generator for 2.38 million years! This requires 15.3 million litres of sea water be processed each second. 0.5 TW is needed to desalinate this much water. A fraction of the power available. So we are good to go!This also produces 67,000 litres per year of fresh water from sea water per person. A fraction of the 3 tons of garbage per person.We start with known Lithium supplies and build out seawater based systems as we go.Treated as revenue sources the power could be secondary to the value of the raw materials produced by such an engine!Reducing bomblets from Hiroshima sized blasts well below Davey Crockett sized blasts of 30 ton equivalent though our bomblets are far smaller (0.8 ml) and far cleaner, (no fissile materials) lets us build 10 floating generators spaced around the planet each 8.368 TW in size. Each near a populous port city.With all revenue streams producing $0.11 per kWh for energy waste processing fresh water raw materials etc the generator owners earn 16% of the $6 per year per watt they create. Of the $50 trillion per year in wealth they create they collect $8 trillion per year!!The cost of the power plant is less than the cost of a conventional nuclear plant or off shore drilling platform. $10 billion tops!","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/Whats-our-current-progress-on-nuclear-fusion-power-and-what-problems-remain

Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s for a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.). Sadly, there has been frustratingly little payoff for all this MCF pure fusion effort as never once in over six decades of effort has any MCF fusion experiment produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds).MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power.ICF fusion worked and produced net energy from fusion from the very first experimental ICF fusion test (Ivy-Mike 1952).Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote equivalent funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). Cold war era Halite-Centurion series underground test shots (1977-1988) were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the underground test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed remotely some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion pure fusion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays. ICF fusion has beenIf the public was comfortable in producing fusion energy in a succession of short fusion “bursts” instead of in a smooth continuous fusion burn; providing funding and committing National Lab design resources in a way comparable to MCF research, we could have with very low technical risk reliable ICF fusion power plants in a time frame that matters (proof of principal within 5 years - commercial ICF power plants in 10 years).","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,5K,47.3K,779.4M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

And many people, including very intelligent scientists and engineers have repeated the learned mantra, “Oil good! renewable bad!” Hopefully intelligent people will start doing their own math soon.

The strong force “glue” between adjacent pairs of nucleons is only just enough to hold it together. So it doesn’t take much disruption to split such a nucleus, resulting in a lot of that pent up energy in the repulsion between protons being released. This is where all the energy release in nuclear fission comes from. To make things even easier, this disruption is readily available in the form of a speeding neutron which is very conveniently released by a nearby nuclear split, causing a chain reaction. It’s a bomb waiting to happen, just requiring sufficient fissile material to be in one place.But with fusion you have to force a pair of protons together against this tremendous repulsive force between them. It’s only a single pair when you’re fusing helium, but you’re still working against the same repulsive force that yields so much energy in fission. The goal in this case is the large amount of energy released when you finally manage to overcome the proton repulsion and get the four nucleons close enough together for the strong force to take over and glue them together. But the barrier you have to overcome to get there is huge.

The primary, when it detonates, first begins to radiate X-rays from its surface, with an energy on the order of 20 keV, corresponding to a temperature of about 200,000,000 K, into the Hohlraum, which is filled with some low-Z material, typically said to be some sort of plastic foam holding the other components of the bomb in place.The low-Z material is very quickly rendered into fully ionized plasma at about the temperature of the X-rays from the primary.The secondary, which contains the fusion fuel, is surrounded by a tamper of high-Z material, and the walls of the Hohlraum are composed of a large mass of some high-Z material. Suddenly the walls of the cavity and the tamper are in contact with fully ionized plasma at 200,000,000 degrees. X-rays of such energies are sufficient to partially ionize and impart significant momentum to atoms of the high-Z material, typically lead or uranium, easily tearing the ionized atoms away from the material. As a result atoms are rapidly ablated from all of the surfaces of high-Z material that are exposed to the plasma, causing rapid jets of material to enter the plasma.At the same time a tremendous amount of momentum is transferred in the opposite direction, causing huge pressure. This compresses the secondary enormously and also begins to cause the walls of the Hohlraum to expand outwards.The compression is very, very fast and it generates tremendous heat and pressure in the fusion fuel, which then satisfies the Lawson criterion, and begins to fuse rapidly, releasing copious fast neutrons as well as much more heat. These fast neutrons can be used to cause fission of uranium included as the high-Z tamper or in the core of the secondary. This greatly increases the energy yield.Eventually the Hohlraum expands too much, and the temperature and pressure both drop as it expands. So finally the fusion cuts off. Then, finally, the fireball reaches the outer skin of the bomb. Everything is vaporized, and the development of the fireball in the atmosphere continues in a very complex manner.The fission primary produces a very efficient compression of the fusion fuel which heats it and makes it denser.

The majority of people today consider “uncontrolled nuclear fusion” as something that cannot be used for constructive purposes.It is widely perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily and smoothly so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, in continuously burning Magnetic Confinement fusion reactors like the international ITER experiment and the planned follow on DEMO Magnetic Confinement demonstration power plant that is expected to one day produce commercial electricity.But is there really a difference (or is it just a difference in perception?)The reality is that the distinction between controlled and uncontrolled fusion is an artificial one devised by early fusion project managers at the Atomic Energy Commission during the mid-1950s during the height of the cold war in an effort to try to win over greater public support for their peaceful fusion reactor projects. AEC managers knew that the public deeply feared the newly invented H-bomb fusion weapons and that some market stratagem was needed to distinguish and separate in the public’s mind explosive H-bombs that they knew the public feared and the peaceful fusion reactors which they wanted to acquire the public’s funding support for. Early politically savvy AEC fusion program managers hit on the idea that we can propose the existence of two different types of fusion (controlled and uncontrolled) when in fact there is just fusion and depending on the specific fusion conditions and the amount of fusion fuel used, will produce a more or less rapid fusion burn and release of energy.Even in thermonuclear weapons, fusion actually produces a rapid thermonuclear burn of plasma versus a neutron driven exponentially increasing chain reaction as in the case of nuclear fission.While the density of the plasma and the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are also all the same.Inertial Confinement Fusion produces fusion power in a series of discrete small controlled controlled bursts of fusion energy. Magnetic Confinement fusion devices like tokamaks attempt to produce smooth controlled thermonuclear burns of plasma, but in reality, no tokamak device has operated producing near to engineered power for more than about five seconds before the plasma containment is lost and the fusion device has to be shut down. Today’s Tokamaks including ITER typically employ a electrical transformer or solenoid to produce an intense plasma current that heats the plasma to fusion conditions. Use of such a transformer drive limits the operation of smooth burning tokamaks to periods of no more than a few hundred seconds or less - even in the very best case.So while the marketing spin is that Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments that produce fusion power in a series of short intense controlled bursts are BAD (explosive – nasty-dangerous), the reality is that ICF fusion can be just as safe and reliable as smooth burning MCF fusion experiments that in reality actually produce power in irregular pulses of unpredictable length of not more than a few hundred seconds in length (best case).","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-nuclear-fission-plant-on-earth

Doing this means that we can have a bigger bang, or use less plutonium, which is one measure of “efficiency”.The complicated version of a thermonuclear bombWe can make an even bigger bang by putting a can of lithium deuteride next to the fission primary, letting it be compressed by the radiation from the detonation (eliding a few steps), making the lithium deuteride fuse. That’s a pretty efficient process, as most of the lithium and deuterium gets to fuse.If you want to add nuclear fuel to the fusion stage, that’s simple, you just add more lithium deuteride to the can. That’s how we make thermonuclear bombs in a variety of yields from 100 kilotons up to a few megatons. No need to do anything fancy outside the bomb.The fusion process is so efficient that the primary doesn’t need to be especially powerful and is the equivalent of a handful of kilotons. If you were determined to make a bigger bang with just plutonium, then you add tritium, as I mentioned above; you can also add more plutonium to the pit. Modern thermonuclear bombs use 2–3 kilos of plutonium; the first generation of nuclear weapons used 6.4 kilos; the second generation experimented with using more plutonium with a large hollow inside to stop it going critical with a more-than-critical mass. It’s a bit awkward, but adding more fuel to the primary at the design stage is doable.Whereas spraying more atoms into the mass at detonation is just not going to be very efficient at all. The neutrons from the mass going super-critical move at around 1% of the speed of light, so the disintegration of a softball-sized pit is over in about 100 times 10cm divided by three hundred million metres per second, which is thirty nanoseconds. This is a small window to aim your uranium hexafluoride ions through.Simulated beams in the LHCYou’re using an accelerator to get those ions up to near-lightspeed, I guess, so a 30-nano-light-second-long beam is about ten metres long. You’re not going to fit a lot of ions in that space. The Large Hadron Collider firesAnd that’s leaving aside that the uranium in those ions — the fluoride doesn’t do anything meaningful, and would probably just get in the way — is probably not going to interact with the neutrons in the chain reaction at all, being at the wrong speed. To cause a chain reaction, the neutrons have to be at a certain window of energies, and lightspeed atoms of uranium aren’t in it.If you’re trying to collide atoms of uranium into plutonium, I don’t even know what that will do, even whether you’d get more energy out of it than you put in. If not, then there’s no point to it, and you’ve just added a lot of weight to your Orion nuclear pulse engine that doesn’t do anything useful. You’re better off just spraying neutrons into the pit at the correct energies, which is, in fact, something that is done as well (see the neutron beam generator in the top diagram). Even if you do get more energy out, there’s still not a lot of point, since you could have just added more nuclear fuel to the bomb at manufacture.So, to sum up, to make more efficient use of plutonium, add tritium and relatively slow neutrons to the bomb at the moment of detonation. To make bigger bangs, add lithium deuteride at manufacture.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,16.0,https://www.quora.com/What-process-do-we-have-to-take-to-run-a-fusion-reactor-e-g-hydrogen-fuel-maybe-heat-etc

Nuclear power has benefitted from bomb technology and infrastructure rather than the other way around. Secondly that the cheapest and easiest and fastest and most easily concealed way to produce bomb materials is still in dedicated facilities. And thirdly that the most effective way yet proposed of reducing the threat of nuclear war is the NPT, with its threefold commitments of the many signatories to disarmament, and non-proliferation, and access to nuclear power. (Maybe read the original if you find what the NPT actually says surprising.)Secondly there is the hysteria surrounding nuclear waste. This is a long solved problem technically, and also financially. It can be easily funded by a small levy on the power produced, and mostly is, and always should be. But “Radiation!” and “Radioactivity!” are potent political slogans for the often well-intentioned but ignorant people who use them.Thirdly there is the even greater hysteria surrounding reactor accidents, despite the excellent safety record of properly designed reactors. This hysteria has killed far more people than have been claimed killed even by the baseless claims of large numbers of deaths from the three serious reactor accidents to date, which with the exception of Three Mile Island, where the containment worked well, have both occurred in badly designed and/or constructed plants.And fourthly, there are the vested in interests in fossil fuel and other alternatives to nuclear, real or imagined.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-5-challenges-to-using-nuclear-power

Decades ago, Fusion was seen as the holy grail of energy because it could power human civilization for hundreds of millions of years. Fission is now capable of that. There are no longer any resource limits to Uranium which can be extracted from seawater economically and that seawater content is essentially self-renewing from uranium that leaches out of bedrock and is circulated up from deep in the earth.Fission reactors are much closer to being able to solve all important technical issues than Fusion - hence are much more susceptible to brute force development approaches. Mass produced small modular uranium fission reactors could permanently solve carbon emissions/ sustainable energy for humanity in the sense Fusion was historically fantasized to do.

These have been promised forJeff Brown email I received:Economical clean energy is less than five years away…As regular readers know, I have been tracking the rise of nuclear fusion technology very closely. And one of my favorite companies in the space, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), just made a big-time announcement.CFS is building a 47-acre research and manufacturing facility just west of Boston. The facility will operate at the location of the old Army post Fort Devens, which is now an economic development zone. That means CFS is getting some tax incentives to build there. It’s a smart move.As a reminder, nuclear fusion is essentially the power of the Sun. It involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean.Unlike nuclearCFS is pursuing the classic tokamak design for its nuclear fusion reactors. We talked about this designThe key to CFS’s approach to its reactor has been through the development of new superconductors that enable advanced magnet technology. This is necessary to control the super-hot plasma in the reactor, causing hydrogen atoms to fuse and release energy.Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ Tokamak ReactorSource: Commonwealth Fusion SystemsCFS believes that this technology will enable compact fusion reactors small enough to fit inside a small room. Yet these reactors will produce enough energy to power 100,000 homes each.We’re talking about a decentralized, clean- energy power grid with zero carbon emissions. That’s the vision.So this is one of the most exciting projects in the nuclear fusion space.And it is very well funded. CFS has raised over $250 million to date, and it will have no problem getting additional funding in the private markets right now. Clean energy is such a hot space right now, and CFS has a clear road map to develop a nuclear fusion reactor.And get this – the new facility is being built right now. CFS expects to have a full-scale demonstration of its new magnet technology by summer. We are just months away.And the company is in a full sprint right now to go from demo to final product. To that end, CFS is doubling the size of its team from 150 to 300 employees. That will put the company on track to potentially have a fully functional nuclear fusion reactor by 2025.That means that the first demonstrations of utility-scale, economical clean energy are less than five years away. I can’t overstate how important this is.And this is why the venture capital and private equity communities are so excited. They won’t have to wait 20 years for a return. We are finally within a relatively short window from an investment perspective.Nuclear fusion is how we get away from burning fossil fuels without sacrificing our ability to provide for the power needs of everybody on the planet.Rather than poking around at the edges and making small contributions to baseload energy generation, nuclear fusion can literally provide for 100% of the world’s need for electricity","4,746 followers",Fergus Mason,6.5K,6.6K,27.8M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-nuclear-really-safe-and-clean-I-am-genuinely-curious

This prevents the neutrons from being absorbed by other U-235 atoms.This heat is then transferred to water which turns to steam and is used to turn a generator that converts the mechanical (kinetic) energy of the rotor to electrical energy.Below is a typical reactor design in the US known as a Pressurized Water Reactor, PWR. If you notice it utilizes two independent water systems to prevent potential release of radioactive fission byproducts to the environment.Nuclear plants run approximately 18 months before needing to refuel. During the refueling process a third of the fuel is removed and replaced with new fuel. Below is a typical core reload diagram. The reload pattern is critical to ensure that the core heats up evenly and you avoid flux tilt. Flux tilt or power tilt, is a specific type of core power distribution problem that could result from a non-symmetrical variation of core power in one quadrant of the reactor core.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we can do this in a controlled manner. That is, we can get things to fuse, but can't sustain the reaction. Thus, we've turned to magnetic confinement fusion.MCF uses a big tube called a tokamak and spins fusable materials along in it. Then, we bombard it with tons of energy, for example, in the form of radio waves, which causes it to heat up. At a certain heat, these materials electrically separate and can be controlled by a magnetic field (magnetic confinement).The idea of fusion reactors is to start the process, and use the excess energy to fuel (sustain) the reaction, as well as extract extra energy. This has been difficult because of the extremely high temperatures required, among other more technical issues. Funding, also, seems to be a major problem (as in all scientific research).The ITER is supposed to be operational in 2018, and if I'm not mistaken, is supposed to be sustainable, although not extractable.Hope that helps.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,3.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-with-controlled-fusion-Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-harness-energy-from-fusion-on-earth-How-long-do-we-have-to-wait-before-we-see-a-fusion-based-power-plant

Venture capital firms have committed large sums to fusion research in hopes that timely profits can be obtained from fusion development.Plasma density is fusion’s “high ground” for commercial competitivenessI believe that the quest to build competitive commercial fusion reactors tends to favor approaches to fusion that are able to use the densest fusion plasma. This is a result of the fact that the power that can be drawn from burning fusion plasma is proportional to the square of the plasma ion density. Approaches to fusion that use dense plasma can be physically smaller and still produce the same amount of fusion energy. Fusion approaches that can only operate using very low density plasma (ion density around 10^14 - 10^15 ions per cubic centimenter) typically have to be scaled to HUGE size to approach break-even energy operation.The following graphic show the typical plasma ion density employed in current fusion experiments.You will note that Magnetic Confinement Fusion tokamak and stellarators operate using plasma that is 10^11 times less dense than Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments. This difference in density of operating plasma gives Inertial Confinement Fusion a competitive advantage (smaller and less costly commercial power plant).Picture comparing the fusion chamber volume of ICF and MCF fusion. Both fusion technologies are capable of producing fusion power but the technology that uses the densest fusion plasma tends to be physically smaller and less costly.Nations that support development of experiments featuring mid to high plasma density will have a competitive commercial advantage over nations who primarily invest in low plasma density fusion technology.No bucks = No buck rogersSome nations are currently doing a better job than others in investing in fusion development.China is currently doing the best job over all in investing in a range of new fusion experiments of differing size and technology. Asian nations are graduating more PhD engineers and physicists today than individual Western nations but Europe collectively graduates more PhDs than Asia.England, for its size, is also investing strongly in fusion and has a vigorous private and public fusion program.Huge amounts of incredibly skillful creative design and innovation have been lavished on the problems involved in bringing to reality practical forms of commercial nuclear fusion. Which ever nation finds success in the commercial fusion quest will provide a huge benefit to all other nations on the planet.Prevailing trends currently in force to internationalize fusion efforts are laudable and hopefully will continue.Private fusion startups located in nations around the world stand an excellent chance of bringing to reality small commercial forms of fusion that can form the basis of competitive fusion power generation and a new fusion nuclear industry.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-with-controlled-fusion-Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-harness-energy-from-fusion-on-earth-How-long-do-we-have-to-wait-before-we-see-a-fusion-based-power-plant

9,"The answer is: It depends.The answer is: It depends.For aneutronic (or mostly aneutronic) designs, the Q can be a bit lower (I have heard 8 or so), because aneutronic reactions release their energy as charged particles. These can then been directly converted to electricity, which can be more efficient than a steam plant. In addition to this, aneutronic reactors suffer from less neutron damage and that lowers service costs and service down times. This is even more true for reactor designs that are more compact, like the one by Helion Energy or Lawrenceville Plasma Physics. The lack of moving parts in the power conversion system is an added benefit that further reduces service times and overall plant cost.Finally, there is another option, that is (in my opinion) unfortunately getting too little attention. That is fusion- fission- hybrids. These reactor designs use neutrons produced by the fusion reaction to drive a fission reaction in a blanket of (mostly or entirely) fertile fuel. Here the fission reaction does most of the work. The advantage over traditional fission reactor designs is that the fission core would be sub critical. So when the fusion reactor is turned, off, the fission reaction ends. So there can not be a meltdown. It can also be used to “burn” nuclear waste, which further reduces costs. For a fusion- fission- hybrid, you can get away even with a Q significantly below 1 for the fusion part (and assumptions here vary, but go from 0.3 to 1).

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,10.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-with-controlled-fusion-Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-harness-energy-from-fusion-on-earth-How-long-do-we-have-to-wait-before-we-see-a-fusion-based-power-plant

They rapidly degrade the structural integrity of materials and render them temporarily highly radioactive.So even if you succeed in creating a stable fusion plasma or imploding enough fuel capsules with a laser array you face the problem of preventing the neutron flux from turning your fancy reactor into a pile of radioactive waste.These problems are so difficult that many experts believe that barring some way to harness gravity like electromagnetism fusion power will remain a pipedream.","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

This was a real contest at the time, and both technologies were tried and each had some commercial success. At the time, some early auto customers might have been skeptical that a vehicle powered by thousands of small explosions inside the confined volume of an engine block would be safe and there was doubt that an engine based on producing thousands of carefully timed explosions would be reliable and hang together and be practical in the long run. Over time, the public came to feel that internal combustion engines, even though they depend on thousands of small explosions, can still be practical and safe, and the Stanley Steamer, and other model continuous burning steam powered vehicles, were abandoned as not as efficient.In the next couple of decades we may see a revisitation of the debate over smooth burning Diffuse Plasma Magnetic Confinement Fusion versus Inertial Confinement Fusion featuring a succession small controlled fusion bursts of between 100 - 250 GJ per shot. It is a harder job to keep reliable containment of a plasma at fusion conditions on a magnetic confinement device like a large tokamak that does a continuous plasma burn - the containment tends to fail and the reactor has to periodically be restarted.

This is why supercomputers have proved so essential in fields like aerodynamic design and weather prediction.Now, try to imagine how challenging it is to model a fluid that experiences turbulence and convection and all the phenomena that gas does, but is moving far faster, is far hotter, and is simultaneously influenced by and creating electromagnetic fields and electric currents. The mind boggles.Still, progress is being made. Some very smart people are chipping away at understanding how fusion plasma works and how to control it, but as you can see, they have their work cut out for them.Edit: To elaborate a bit since this is getting views, the success of magnetic confinement fusion is often measured with a metric called the “triple product.” This is confinement time x density x temperature. All of these are of course important. Temperature and density both affect your power output; higher densities and temperatures yield more energy per cubic meter, which is important as far as getting more energy out than you put in.So, why am I focusing on confinement? Heating the plasma isn't difficult, it's keeping it hot (which means keeping the most energetic nucleii from wriggling through your confinement fields). And higher density also requires stronger confinement fields. So both density and temperature are contingent on keeping the plasma contained. Stability is more important than field strength, too: instabilities can build and overwhelm the strongest fields. Hence the importance of understanding the minutiae of magnetohydrodynamics, and the incredibly complex modeling and math required.Again, progress is being made. Confinement times used to be measured in fractions of a second, while today fusion plasma (not just plasma but plasma undergoing fusion) has been confined for over 100 seconds at a time.","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

Conversion to usd and adding crazy costs overruns, lets say it ultimately costs $30b to build a 3.2GWe plant. Fuel cost in a fission plant is negligible, less than 5% of the CAPEX of the land over its full life cycle, but say uranium becomes so rare that it costs millions of dollars per ton. Engineers now refuse to work unless they're paid half million a year. Lifetime cost becomes double CAPEX, and HPC costs $60b to build and run. HPC would cost $20b per GW, while ITER still costs $28b per GW. Remember that HPC is licensed for 60 years and can be extended to 120 years. No one is sure if the ITER can even last 40.Fusion is built on a story that as long as fuel cost is low, electricity becomes cheap and abundant. Consider that renewable energy fuel cost is zero, and offshore wind and CSPs are still one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Fusion will have to cut CAPEX cost by 100 times to fulfill the dreams of its fans.","220,154 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,16.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

A survey would probably be difficult as not many people have an understanding of generation 4 nuclear energy. And most people would be against nuclear power of any type. Though their understanding of nuclear power is very poor.There is some slow change in Washington with Generation 4 reactors getting more recognition. Currently, there may be no detailed planning that would be needed to get approval for a reactor. There is not support from industries and businesses to get to the proposal stage. Generation 4 prototypes need to be built as the next major step in the US.Applications for licensing is very expensive and complicated. Current licensing policies are based on current reactor technology and getting approval for a generation 4 reactor would be even more complicated.I think the Chinese will be able to continue without further US support. China has started the operation of Gen 4 gas-cooled reactor using pebble bed fuel. The pebbles are made from heat resistant carbon and silicon materials that are unlikely to melt. If cooling, power or pumps fail these reactors can remain safe by using natural airflow. The pebbles are routinely checked as they go through the system. When checked they can be easily returned to the reactor or be replaced if damage is suspected or a risk. The reactor does not need to be turned off for refueling. The pebbles are easily replaced or returned to the top of the reactor as other pebbles empty from the bottom. The longer the pebbles last the more fuel is burnt and less waste is produced. No metal fuel rods that could melt are needed. And no high pressure water is in the reactor. The fuel spheres, pebbles can tolerate more than twice the heat a fuel rod. Meltdown are highly unlikely.It is also likely that China is about to complete a Molten Salt Reactor/ MSR, that also has no fuel rods or water. The fuel is mixed with the salt coolant. The salt/fuel mix can be safely drained from the reactor at any time into safe cooling tanks. Overheating will automatically drain the salt before any meltdown. The salt has an unlimited lifespan so fuel can remain in the reactor until most of the fuel is burnt. Including the radioactive products produced from fission. Leaving minimal waste. Potentially salt reactors can run on nuclear waste from current PWR reactors. Without expensive separation of the toxic products. MSR reactors should use up far more waste than they produce. No need for expensive metal fuel rods or pebbles.China also holds the record for fusion reactors. Operating a research reactor producing plasma at twice the heat of the suns core for 100 seconds.China is also building a number of advanced water-cooled reactors from different countries. India plans to build over 50 nuclear power plants. It will soon have a very good understanding of the technologies available to help decide which reactors are best to be built in future.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,17.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

THE SILVER MAGNETS ARE POWERED SUPER MAGNETS. MERY EXPENSIVE.A much more effective and timely option could be the development of Next Generation, Generation 4, Fission reactors that will be much easier to build. Gen 4 reactors are less complex. But it is slowed down by testing of materials and equipment. And in some countries, the difficult bureaucratic process is expensive and time-consuming. With more efficient development fission reactors could be developed much faster. As it is being done in China.I think a number of prototypes could be built in 10 years and operational reactors could be in production in factories and shipyards. Most of the research, material, designs and equipment is already available. It would be less complex than the Manhattan project that started from scratch in 5 years. China is about the only country seriously developing Generation 4 reactors.+Generation 4 reactors are designs that are highly resistant to meltdowns even with failure of pumps and power for cooling. Using natural, physical properties There are a number of different types using a variety of coolants and fuels.China has just started operation of an air-cooled reactor using a pebble bed system with fuels in spheres of very heat resistant materials with long lifespans and easy testing and replacement. Natural air circulation can maintain cooling if it is needed. The reactor does not need to be shut down to refuel it.China is also developing a Molten SaltReactor, MSR, and a Travelling Wave reactor. The MSR uses molten salt for cooling, heat transfer and actually contains the nuclear fuel and moves it through a graphite reactor core. The salt can operate at higher temperatures than Pressurised Water Reactors, PWRs, that are currently in common use. The very high temperature, good for industrial uses as well as desalination and production of liquid fuels. At any time the Molten Salt can be removed from the reactor core into a safe holding tank without risk of meltdown. This can be done automatically before any risk of meltdown. It is walkaway safe. These reactors could run on Thorium that is 3 times more common than Uranium. It does not need enrichment and can use up almost all the nuclear fuel, leaving very little waste. Thorium is a byproduct of rare earth mining so it is easily available.The Traveling Wave Reactor, TWR, is self-contained and does not need refueling. It operates over a number of years on depleted Uranium waste which is already available in large amounts as low-grade nuclear waste. The Chinese TWR is based on a US design. It is hoped that this reactor will be very easy to operate and can be used in less developed countries. So it is designed to be simple and very safe to operate. When it eventually runs out of fuel it is replaced and returned to the factory where it is built for storage and recycling.Smaller and modular reactors could be produced more effectively and faster in a factory and transported to site. Able to fit in with existing infrastructure and transported to where it is needed. And used in countries that do not have advanced nuclear industries.Large scale production could be a vital option for low carbon energy and prototypes should be built. If they work as expected they could supply safe, cheap and clean power. With hundreds of years of fuel giving us the time to develop effective fusion energy.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

Shorter trips use less propellantThat's because;We know how to make small hydrogen bombs.http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdfWe know what materials to choose to be Aneutronic to eliminate much of the shielding requirement.We know how to detonate pulse units without using atomic bombs as triggers.https://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:7ab2ff58-4bd9-4142-a016-845036a71fe7/233.pdfhttp://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/16/019/16019198.pdfWe know how to confine and direct the entire plasma wave without a heavy pusher plate. This radically increases thrust to weight while improving exhaust speed.It was the reason Daladeus selected this approach.Project Daedalus : Hoover, Thomas : Free Download & Streaming : Internet ArchiveProject Daedalus - Interstellar MissionThis requiresWithout these specific decisions we are left with highly speculative approaches that require significant research that could at any moment be classified out of existence.Without direct application of microfusion blasts in an electromagnetic thrust chamber the fusion rocket remains a theoretical and speculative designSince the design then relies on the development of fusion power technology beyond current capabilities, and requires the construction of rockets much larger and more complex than any current spacecraft.The surest way of building a fusion rocket with current technology is to use hydrogen bombs as proposed in Project Orion, but such a spacecraft would also be massive due to its pusher plate and of efficiency of energy coupling to the vehicle. Electromagnetic pulse and fission pollution make further problems.The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear bombs as propulsion. Therefore, the use of nuclear bombs to propel rockets on Earth is problematic, but possible in space in theory well beyond Earth.The answer here is to create micro fusion only pulse units and don't call them bombs. Also, you may use chemical rockets and solar power to operate well beyond Earth and establish an independent nuclear capacity beyond Earth. This runs up against the same sorts of barriers that keep critical information classified.FutureOnce space travel is solved then developElectricityWe will solve the energy problems of industry. Capturing $4 trillion per year in revenue.Designing an electromagnetic thrust chamber that directs the plasma of a series of microfusion blasts to produce thrust also makes a practical MHD generator using the same approach. In this way two or more chambers may be connected to produce significant Alternating current and very low exhaust velocity. Here we absorb the explosions on magnetic fields and tap the current off the containment vessels to drive your load.Ion rockets a non starter when joined with ICFIn theory you could use this to energize ion engines like vasimir but you will not obtain higher exhaust speeds as the plasma you started with or achieve the same thrust to weightLaserA new tool in addition to defense.Microfusion induced laser action is also possible by reconfiguring the plasma chamber to support laser action.Nuclear Pumped Gas LasersWhile much research is directed toward large lasers to create inertial confinement fusion success with an appropriate rocket program gives powerful fusion pumped lasers.These too are classified.https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk3/1984/8410/841005.PDFAdvanced material processingPowerful lasers break down rock and gas and liquids into plasma.

While nuclear power is unpopular there are countries that appreciate the benefits of low carbon and safety. Poor and less developed countries may see nuclear power as part of development of rich countries. Many very powerful countries have nuclear power.Even if reactors are being built in other countries it can still affect its neighbors. So development of safer nuclear power should be of concern to everyone. Even opponents of nuclear power must realize that better nuclear technology is important. China has a huge nuclear energy program building a number of different reactors from different countries. And including Next Generation, Gen 4 reactors. They are planning for over 50 nuclear power stations. They will be able to find which reactors are suitable for their needs.The US has fallen behind in reactor technology. Not being able to develop prototypes. But this may soon change. As the potential for Gen 4 technologies are understood politicians may change their views.The anti-nuclear groups say that investing in Gen 4 technology will be a waste of money and resources. And will take to long to develop. But there is plenty of resources available. We should be spending more money on a variety of low carbon energy-producing technologies.

That can be almost anything since fusion will convert mass to energy. But like chemical rockets, fuel is weight — or more correctly, it’sIon Propulsion systemsA big problem is the mass of any ship or probe you send out. Depending on your propulsion system, you will likely need a way of shielding the payload — people or equipment — from any effects of the drive system. One way is to use dense metal shielding (e.g. lead) to stop beta and gamma particles from killing the crew. Another is distance, such as placing the drive system at the rear of a long structure, well away from the payload areas. Either method creates extra mass, either in shielding or long, rigid structures to connect the drive system to the rest of the ship.Complicating FactorsLet’s suppose you could actually achieve 25% ofSo you have to protect the crew.Armor shielding would add far too much mass. A combination of metals, ceramics andYou have the same problems with a probe, though you don’t have the complexities of crew quarters, lavatories, food, water and air supplies. But you still need to shield the delicate and sensitive instruments from “flight damage” as well as shielding systems.Every problem you solve is likely to add unwanted extra mass to the project. This is the kind of problem that drove early spaceflight pioneers to drink. Just to break free of Earth’s gravity required an enormous mass of fuel, adding more mass to be lifted in structures to contain it. Until they broke it down into rocket stages, the problem seemed insurmountable.Now that we’re assuming you’ve run up to 25% of light speed, start thinking of how you willSpace flight is",9 followers,Bill Caffrey,1.3K,3K,16.6M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about

To put this in perspective, one of the fastest human built objects is the Parker Solar Probe, which achieved speeds of 213,200 miles per hour, or about 3.1% of our 0.01 c speed. What allowed the Parker Solar probe to achieve such incredible speeds, is a combination of several factors, starting with the launch of the spacecraft on a Delta IV Heavy rocketEven with this powerful launch vehicle, it couldn’t have achieved anywhere close to its mission parameters, or breaking the speed record. In order to achieve that, the spacecraft will perform seven flybys of the planet Venus, in order to slowly lower its closest approach to the sun. In January of this year, it passed 19.4 billion meters from the Sun, and it will perform this same flyby in June. In December 2025, the probe will achieve its closest flyby, which is 6.9 billion meters from the Sun’s center or 6.2 billion meters from the Sun’s surface. This is only 9 solar radii away from the Sun, and reach 430,000 miles per hour, or 6% or our target speed.As other answers have pointed out, the first hurdle to achieving 1% of the speed of light is the matter of fuel energy density. Chemical propulsion is nowhere near dense enough to get close, the fastest speeds achieved by chemical rockets is the launch of the New Horizons probe, about 36,400 miles per hour, and that was using an Atlas V, one of the most powerful rockets currently in service. In order to achieve 1% of the speed of light, we’ll need more efficient and more powerful forms of propulsion, and there are quite a few that you could choose from, far too many to mention here.The next hurdle is acceleration. We as humans can only survived sustained g-forces for so long before you start encountering organ failure, you actually reach the point where the structures inside us will literally be torn apart. Accelerations from fractions of 1 g (Earth surface gravity), up to about 2 to 3 g’s would probably be sustainable for a decent amount of time, from months at fractions of g to about 1 to 2 g, from days or hours perhaps of 3 g or so. Once you get into the higher accelerations, the kind usually only experienced in amusement park rides for fractions of a second, or in maneuvers in high speed aircraft, then you get down to less than several hours. Even higher accelerations would require even smaller time frames in order to be survivable. The highest acceleration ever survived by a human being was 46.2 g, and that was only for a fraction of a second.That being said, it wouldn’t take that much acceleration to get to 1% of the speed of light. If you wanted to accelerate at a comfortable 1 g, it would take 305,810 seconds, or 3.51 days. The distance traveled while accelerating at 1 g for that long is just over 4 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. If you accelerated five times faster, or 5g, it would only take 61,652 seconds, or 17 hours, and you would only travel about 62% of the average Earth-Sun distance.As other answers have pointed out, a major problem with traveling at these velocities is debris. This is a problem even with current space travel, and we travel much slower. As you get faster and faster, the relative velocity of debris gets larger and larger, and even the smallest of particles can eventually get deadly. Imagine a grain of sand hitting a target at 3 million meters per second. The kinetic energy of such a projectile would be 1.35 mega Joules, or about the same amount of kinetic energy of a Chevy Tahoe traveling at 67 miles per hour. What makes the grain of sand hitting you even worse than the truck hitting you is that the grain of sand has an incredibly small area. This is what allows small, fast moving projectiles to punch through materials that would easily stop a truck. Any reasonable solution to this problem adds mass, and thereby decreases how quickly you can accelerate to 1% of the speed of light, and also how far you can go based on the amount of fuel you have.Another consideration that needs to be made that other answers have touched upon is that you have to slow down in order to arrive at your destination, unless the destination is traveling at 1% of the speed of light. This is why the most time efficient way of traveling between any two points in space with constant acceleration involves accelerating towards the target for half the journey, and decelerating for the second half. This turns navigational problems into less a consideration of how fast you can get, which in space is rather meaningless, since any object given enough time, acceleration, and fuel can get up to some ridiculously fast speeds, but more a consideration of max acceleration. With a decent long term constant acceleration, you can get anywhere in the inner solar system within a week, anywhere in the solar system in a month, maybe two depending on orbital position. The Moon is about 3 and a half hours, about the same as a long regional flight, say London to Athens.","2,494 followers",Jim Reich,1.4K,6.1K,5.8M,9.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about

It will require more volume for the same amount of impulse, but if you work your way through the fairly complex optimization, you can probably mix LH2 and Kerosene to shrink the stack somewhat. Shrink your payload smaller than the Apollo capsule and you’ll do better yet. Maybe it’ll be only a few miles across at the base instead of the size of a mountain.

This supposes that there has been plenty of time for intelligent civilizations to interact within our galaxy when one examines the age and number of stars, as well as the distances between them. Yet, the fact that extra-terrestrial intelligence has never been observed leads to a logical paradox where our observations are inconsistent with our theoretical expectation. This original question from Fermi seemed to also reinforce the prevailing paradigm at the time that interstellar travel was impossible. Project Daedalus was a bold way to examine the Fermi Paradox head on and gave a partial answer – interstellar travel is possible. The basis of this belief was the demonstration of a credible engineering design just at the outset of the space age that could in theory, cross the interstellar distances. In the future scientific advancement would lead to a refined and more efficient design. The absence of alien visitors would therefore require a different explanation because Project Daedalus demonstrated that with current, and near future, technology, interstellar travel is feasible. Therefore, another solution to the absence of extra-terrestrial visitation was necessary.There were three stated goals for Project Daedalus:The two-stage engine configuration was powered by inertial confinement fusion using deuterium and helium-3 pellets. Electron beam diodes positioned around the base of the engine exhaust would impinge on the pellets and ignite them to produce large energy gain, at a rate of 250 detonations per second. This would continue for a boost phase lasting over 3.8 years followed by a cruise phase lasting 46 years and travelling at over 12% of the speed of light until the 450 tons science probe would finally reach its destination of the Barnard’s Star system 5.9 light years away, which it would transit in a matter of days due to its flyby nature.Also Orion could work.The “nuclear pollution” from this would be small set next to existing atomic bomb testing pollution.Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) - WikipediaAn atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 9%–11% of the speed of light.You have a bomb magazine and after each detonation of a bomb under the pusher plate, another bomb is fired using a cannon through the shown hole in the pusher plate in the figure.One pusher plate. Steam or pneumatic cylinders acting as shock absorbers between the pusher plate & main hull.The bomb detonates at a predetermined distance behind the pusher plate and timed so the pusher plate is at or near full extension of the shock absorbers. The bomb detonation pushes the plate forward and the shock absorbers change a sudden violent impulse to a much smoother acceleration with the level of acceleration not exactly constant, but generally if done right does not exceed safe accelerations for human bodies and no negative acceleration felt by the crew.Nor were “standard” nuclear weapons used.The shape of the bomb's reaction mass is critical to efficiency. The original project designed bombs with a reaction mass made of tungsten (A bomb with a cylinder of reaction mass expands into a flat, disk-shaped wave of plasma when it explodes. A bomb with a disk-shaped reaction mass expands into a far more efficient cigar-shaped wave of plasma debris.The cigar shape focuses much of the plasma to impinge onto the pusher-plate.The bomb would detonate a preset distance below the pusher plate well centered with the propellent end pointed at the pusher plate. That is tungsten or some similar very dense metal as opaque as possible to X-rays and gamma rays. That turns the nuclear explosion into practical thrust by bouncing the tungsten plasma off the pusher plate.This is a sophisticated well-developed designTest footage of the concept built into models with chemical explosive charges to show how it would work.",2 followers,Richard Muller,5K,2.3K,201.9M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about

It takes a lot more energy to fly than to walk because the air “gives” a lot more than dirt does and that “give” is an action that doesn’t generate the desired reaction- compare walking on loose sand. Still, it provides sufficient survival advantage that flight evolved.But in space there’s literally nothing dense enough to be worth even trying to push against, not even the relatively thick interplanetary medium (basically the Solar Wind,Rockets have to carry their own mass to push against, and once pushed, that “reaction mass” is left behind, and it can’t be re-used.Rockets come in different types- straight-up chemical combustion rockets that use solid or liquid fuels, ion rockets, drawing-board plasma rockets (like VASIMR) and nuclear rockets… all of them can be rated efficiency-wise by something calledThere are some caveats- for instance ion engines have a relatively low fuel consumption rate so they have good efficiency there, but they derive the energy to push the propellant away from an onboard power supply, where chemical engines derive the power from the fuel itself.Rocket scientists have tried all sorts of combinations of chemical fuels. All of them have associated hazards- they are after all energy-storage media, and the more energy they store the more hazardous they are if something goes wrong. The most common high-thrust fuel in use is liquid hydrogen combined with the oxidizer liquid oxygen, and you probably have some idea of how dangerous they both are.The chemical system with the highest efficiency ever tested is a mixture of lithium, fluorine and hydrogen, but the hazards outweigh the benefits.The rocket engine with the highest theoretical specific impulse is the so-calledA very bright fellow named Robert Bussard had the idea of designing a sort of interstellar ramjet that worked by collecting, “burning” and expelling the hydrogen gas that seems to be pretty much everywhere between the planets and the stars. That way it would have both an unlimited fuel supply and an unlimited power supply. I put “burning” in quotes because his idea is to run the hydrogen through an onboard fusion reactor, which we don’t know how to build yet. It has some issues beyond that though- when he came up with the idea the amount of available hydrogen was thought to be much higher than we now know it to be, it would collect the hydrogen with a very powerful magnetic field which would act as a scoop requiring it to be accelerated to a significant fraction of c by onboard fuel or some sort of booster before it could collect fuel, and there is some controversy whether the energy expended in collecting the hydrogen is greater than that to be gained from it (in other words it might act more as a brake than an engine).Ever since someone thought up the idea of an “There’s also the “You may have hear of the recent “We can’t get up to a significant fraction of light using rockets because the universe just doesn’t work that way.

This device was necessary according to Edward Teller because the Soviets exploded an atomic bomb in September 1949 only 37 months after the USA detonated its first atomic bomb in August 1945, decades earlier than the CIA estimated this would occur putting US military and State Department into a panic resulting in the arrest and prosecution of the Rosenbergs and the Red Scare ultimately.The atomic bomb involved rapidly assembling a critical mass of heavy fissile material that then promptly underwent a fission reaction of all the material producing all the energy in the fissile material promptly creating a massive explosion. The minimum fissile material from 12 to 60 kg determined the minimum explosive yield 1 quadrillion to 5 quadrillion joules. 240 kT to 1.2 MT equivalent yield. 12 kT yield of first atomic bombs give the inefficiency of the reaction mechanism and made the bombs very dirty.The hydrogen bomb involved fusion of lightweight fusable material that released substantially more energy per unit mass (270 TJ/kg vs 82 TJ/kg) but required very energetic conditions to undergo a reaction. The hydrogen bomb took advantage of a unique feature in the periodic table of elements in the presence of a secondary binding energy peak at Helium in addition to the peak at Iron. This meant that Lithium and Beryllium can be a fission source and Boron has a role to play as well. In 1949 immediately following the Soviet bomb Ulrich Jetter outlined a cycle of reactions that could be made into a pseudo-fission mediated reaction whose primary energy was fusion. That is, a fission of Lithium to Helium and Tritium provided a spark to cause the Tritium to fuse immediately with Deuterium if present releasing the bulk of the energy. This so-called ‘Jetter Cycle’ wasLithium-6 + neutron → Helium-4 + Hydrogen-3 + 4.8 MeV [1]Hydrogen-3 + Hydrogen-2 → Helium-4 + n + 17.6 MeV [2]Lithium-6 + Hydrogen-2 → 2 Helium-4 + 22.4 Mev [1]+[2]This reaction releases 270.3 TJ/kg of fuel and is aneutronic in the end leaving only alpha particles and heat.To make this into a self sustaining pseudo-fission reaction that could be managed with existing techniques required the conversion of energetic neutron flux and energetic alpha particles into more low energy neutrons. The neutron conversion was provided by an admixture of Beryllium to convert energetic alpha particles and neutrons to neutrons. Boron can be used to convert energetic neutrons to alpha particles cleaning up the reaction and leaving nothing but helium with only slight reduction of energy density. Subcritical techniques that produce a pulse of neutrons in a small pellet of Lithium-6 Deuteride provide the means to produce very small very clean explosions.The commercial potential of the Jetter Cycle was explored as part of Project Sherwood. The chair of the Atomic Energy Commission at the time Lewis Strauss reported results to the press suggested that by 1970, a point in time identified by Shell geophysicist Marion King Hubbert said the USA would run out of adequate oil supplies, that energy would be ‘too cheap to meter’. This resulted in a media storm with Strauss on the cover of Time Magazine and feature articles about our atomic future in Forbes. RAND Corporation scientist Herman Kahn said that if energy becomes too cheap to meter in 1970 Communism would be defeated by 1990 because by that date Capitalism would have made all the world’s proletariats millionaires and all would be Capitalists as a result. Congress scheduled hearings on the future of energy and vowed to the public a crash program on the future of fusion energy. Congress invited AEC scientists who worked on Sherwood to give testimony to Congress. Unfortunately, those scientists died in a freak helicopter crash at the Pacific test range before they could give testimony. As a result Strauss himself gave testimony. Apparently the scientists work prior to their appearance were lost or not prepared in the first place. After Strauss was sworn in he gave an opening statement on Project Sherwood but was ambushed by Congress and asked about misappropriation of funds in the AEC and his failure to follow national security procedures and his relationship to the Rosenbergs. This resulted in his dismissal called the ‘Strauss Affair’. Meanwhile, a blue ribbon panel organised by President Eisenhower resulted in the discrediting of Hubbert’s logistic theory about oil, and the oil executives assured the nation that there was plenty of oil in the Middle East, and we could safely rely on that after 1970 for centuries to come. JCS reviewing the dismissal of AEC Chair Strauss in the wake of the Rosenberg trial felt that there had to be thorough review of public information which resulted in the classification of many aspects of Project Sherwood that were previously public information. John Wheeler’s research lab at Princeton remained in the public domain and this has since been the focus of ‘hot fusion’ research which attempts to use magnetic fields to sustain break even. Other approaches attempt to use the ‘hot fusion’ technique absent the use of neutrons to take the obvious route described by Jetter to promote ‘inertial confinement fusion’. Low Energy Nuclear Reactions and reaction combinations have been largely dismissed by the research community, largely on national security grounds.The Brookings Institute released information at this time which was classified in this process.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,154 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,5.0,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-we-could-reach-nuclear-fusion-ignition-how-efficient-would-the-change-from-fusion-energy-to-electricity-be

This requires extreme confinement so that the materials don't fly apart.In a typical fusion weapon the thermal radiation of a fission bomb in the form of X-rays is used to thermally ablate the heavy metal tamper containing the fusion fuel. The reaction force provides extreme compression. The heat is typically augmented by a fissionable spark plug in the center.It only takes about a microsecond or less to consume the majority of the fusion fuel.In a fusion power reactor you have to obtain a controlled long term fusion reaction.Control is easy in a fission reaction by using control rods that absorb neutrons to regulate the reaction.Since fusion isn't a chain reaction the main obstacle is keeping it going by minimizing energy loss.There are two approaches.One is to use a huge array of lasers to ablate a tiny metal encased fuel pellet like a tiny hydrogen bomb and simply repeat the process to make a continuous output of energy controlled by how rapidly you consume the pellets.This is called inertial confinement.The second is magnetic confinement using a plasma confined by powerful electromagnetic fields and heated sufficiently to achieve continuous fusion at a moderate level.This is often called the Tokamak after the Soviet device of the 1980s.The problem with both is that nobody has succeeded in a long-term sustainable reaction, let alone how to turn it into electrical power.A second problem is the high energy neutrons emitted by fusion. These are nearly impossible to shield and will rapidly degrade the structural integrity of the reactor.For this reason some experts believe that sustainable fusion power is impossible.","220,154 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,9.0,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-we-could-reach-nuclear-fusion-ignition-how-efficient-would-the-change-from-fusion-energy-to-electricity-be

And this part is decided by natural science --- science and technology. There is a time limit decided by the material provisions reserve to support your journey --- you have to reach your goal before your provisions run out.When our provisions --- the real value reserve on the Earth is limited, we cannot afford to go the wrong way, and the faster we go on the wrong way, the worse off we will be in this journey.

What purpose it serves will decide this technology will be beneficial or harmful to us for our real interest --- human perpetual survival.2.

And the final result can be predicted by simple logic: real value on the Earth will be exhausted and this process will be stopped. But when that is proved by the reality of that time, the lesson will be of no use to anybody because no one can survive by then.3.	Science and technology development fundamentally cannot over pace the growth of human material needs.Under present social conditions, any science and technology break through only result in boost population and material production and consumption that only will result in real value early exhaustion and shortened life chain.

Can controlled fusion energy production solve world energy problem once and for all?A rough estimation:Conditions:Data:Calculation:From this result we can see:1)	It is not a thorough solution for our energy problem.5.	Under controlled fusion energy production, can world material production and world environment loading capacity reach sustainability? What will be the survival conditions change for people in the world?Just like every breakthrough in science and technology in history, if this supposed controlled fusion energy production comes true, it will effect on human life the same way as what happened before: temporarily alleviate the limitation on people’s material needs, followed by increased population and production, consumption. Then very soon, other natural limitations will jump out as “bottle necks” in front of human material needs: land, water, soil quality, air quality, bio diversity, eco system health, human health. And people will try to open the “bottle necks” one by one, and in the meantime create more and more and bigger and bigger problems…6.	The nature of the present game --- unsustainability.In a logical sense, when real value is limited, and you want to use it the longest time span, the fundamental solution is to use it as sparely as possible in a planned way but not further dig into the possibility on how to use it more and use it quicker.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/In-layman-terms-why-are-fusion-reactors-producing-less-energy-than-it-is-fed-into-them-When-will-they-crack-the-puzzle

The cost of fusion power plants must be no higher than competitive forms of energy.The cost of the international ITER fusion experiment -At the inception of the international ITER fusion reactor project, ITER was expected to cost €5 billion (US$6.8 billion). ITER has over the decades suffered delays, several costly redesigns, and project setbacks.The US, at project inception, pledged to pay 9.1% of the total project cost and this was originally thought to be about US$610 million dollars.Recently, Congress requested that DOE’s Office of Science’s office of project assessment (OPA) prepare an updated estimate for the US portion of ITER’s cost, using conservative assumptions based on performance to date and reasonable projections for the future. OPA’s estimate was announced by DOE.OPA’s responded with an updated estimate for the cost of the US portion of ITER -“The new cost estimate, which is a range from $4.0 to $6.5 billion, is a reflection of the historical cost growth of the project and the high level of risk and uncertainty' associated with this highly complicated international undertaking.”If you project out OPA’s estimate for the 9.1% pledge the US has made to the ITER project, the US pledge to ITER is now expected to be between US$4 billion and US$6.5 billion; according to OPA,Using DOE OPA's best estimate, the shared total ITER project cost to the international consortium is now ultimately expected to range from US$44 billion to US$75 billion.US taking a hard look at its involvement in ITERThe nuclear community needs to seriously consider the implications for the cost of fusion power plantsThere currently may be greater hope for cost competitive commercial fusion from technology implemented by small fusion startups.LPP Fusion is the name of a leading small US company innovating fusion.One of the keys to practical production of fusion power is to meet the basic conditions required for fusion (the famous Lawson criteria of temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time). At least one small fusion experiment at Lawrenceville Plasma Physics headed up by Dr. Eric Lerner has at this point technically already met the minimal conditions for D-T fusion.D + T -> 2He-4 (3.5 MeV) + neutron (14.1 MeV)The Lawson criterion for fusion ignition and break-even with D-T fusion is about 4 x 10^15 keV s/cm^3.Eric Lerner of Lawrenceville Plasma Physics reports in peer reviewed literature that his experiment has achieved 5 x 10^15 keV s/cm^3In theory, LPP should not be that far away, but they are not putting effort into D-T or D-D fusion at this time (although in the past they have made many runs using Deuterium fuel and D-D fusion). D-T fusion is the fusion reaction that is easiest to achieve - but LPP is not currently interested in going that direction.LPP isn't really interested in D-T type fusion. The ""problem"" with D-T fusion is that a lot of the energy in D-T comes in the form of 14.1 MeV high-energy neutrons, which tend to make reactor materials highly radioactive via neutron activation. In theory you can capture that energy the same way you do with a conventional nuclear reactor (that is, by using the radiation to get something like liquid Lithium hot and using it to boil water or heat molten salt to run a turbine). Part of the problem with D-T fusion is the tritium itself, which is radioactive unlike deuterium fusion fuel, and LPP doesn't want to get into all those radioactive-materials handling issues. Tritium is also very expensive to purchase (about $30,000 per gram as estimated by Los Alamos National Lab).So LPP has chosen to set their sights just a bit higher. They plan to bypass easier to achieve D-T and the cheap and very sustainable D-D fusion reaction in favor of aneutronic fusion (for me, the is a questionable and perhaps unfortunate choice - neutronic fusion producing a huge number of high value neutrons is valuable and could be used for applications like nuclear waste burning, medical isotope production, and manufacture of fuel for fission reactors, as well as producing electricity from fusion).The fusion reaction LPP prefers is called p-B-11, which uses conventional hydrogen (which becomes a bare proton, p, when ionized) and boron-11, which is over 100X more difficult to ignite in a tokamak (and is about 20X as hard to ignite in a properly designed Inertial Confinement Fusion device).[1] - Ivy-Mike nuclear test performed in 1952 -[2] - LPP at Google's Solve for X Conference - still leading the field -Historical Fact - Over the past five decades the technical advance of fusion experiments as measured by the Fusion Triple product nTt doubles every 1.8 years -this is a more rapid trend of sustained technical advance than the growth of the number of transistors on CPU chips (Moore’s Law)..",2 followers,Richard Muller,681,2.3K,201.9M,13.0,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-energy-crisis-be-solved-if-sustained-nuclear-fusion-became-a-reality-What-are-its-negative-effects

And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor.

Unfortunately, it takes a lot of energy to keep a plasma both hot and contained.“Hydrogen fusion” (actually D-D or D-T reactions) releases an incredible amount of energy. In principle, there should be enough to keep the reaction going, along with more energy we can use. The problem is that we lose enormous amounts of energy in our reactors.

A meltdown may be caused by a loss of reactor coolant or loss of coolant pressure. A meltdown can also be caused by a low coolant flow rate or be the result of a spike in the fission reaction rate which causes the reactor to overheatWhy do nuclear power plants meltdown?A nuclear power plant core meltdown is a type of nuclear accident which occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the reactors cooling systems to the point where at least a few of the hundreds of solid fuel rods containing Uranium fuel has its fuel rod outer wrappers (called cladding) melt. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of reactor coolant or loss of coolant pressure. A meltdown can also be caused by a low coolant flow rate or be the result of a spike in the fission reaction rate which causes the reactor to overheat. A spike in fission reaction rate, if not corrected, could result in a run away to ever higher temperatures resulting in a meltdown of fuel rods and damage to the fission reactor structure.Not all reactors are subject to core meltdowns. It is primarily only solid fuel water or sodium cooled reactors that are subject to this safety vulnerability. There are classes of nuclear reactors that can not melt down. One such class of meltdown free nuclear reactor is called a Molten Salt Reactor.Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are fluid fueled reactors where the Uranium fuel is dissolved in fluoride molten salts. With MSRs, there are no fuel rods or core formed of fuel assemblies that can melt - the Uranium fuel is dissolved directly in the salt, so this class of reactor cannot melt down.Fusion reactors are also considered meltdown proof as in a fusion reactor, there are no fuel rods, only high temperature fusion plasma confined by a strong magnetic field or by the natural inertia of fusion fuel.The most likely fusion reactions to first be explored release only a relatively small amount of the energy generated by fusion as heat. With Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fusion, 80% of the energy of the fusion reaction is released as energetic neutrons and only 20% of the energy of fusion is released as heat. In an accident, a fusion reactor does not tend to over-heat and melt. Most accidents should result in a immediate halt to production of fusion energy, so a fusion power plant just immediately stops working and producing heat when accidents arise.Some reasons why nuclear fusion power plants are likely to be even safer than fission power plants and less subject to meltdown.","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,2.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nuclear-power-plants-meltdown

I think a pure fusion machine that doesn’t amplify energy output with fission will follow within 20 years, but it may never be economically competitive with pure fission or fission/fusion hybrid machines. On the other hand, I think it is naive to make any predictions of technology beyond ~100 years except where basic laws of physics constrain things (e.g. faster than light space travel). Nobody can say how politics, science, and engineering will progress beyond 50 years. Who knows? We might even come to our senses with respect to radiation fear and begin to really become concerned about global climate change. I think that will take at least 50 years though.I think perhaps a fusion rocket application will be developed within 50 years where the advantages of using hydrogen reaction mass tilt advantage towards a pure fusion machine and where cost is less important than in terrestrial power applications where so many alternatives exist. Also, the space application has the advantage of being in an already high radiation environment and perhaps adequately far from population to quell fear.","220,155 followers",Franklin Veaux,550,47.3K,779.4M,13.0,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-main-fuel-for-fusion-reactors

The theory was presented his paper, “ The Internal Constitution of The Stars.” Around 1938, German nuclear physicist Hans Bethe formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis based on proton-proton fusion. This turned out to be the correct explanation for the mechanism by which stars generate energy. Prior to 1920, the source of stellar energy was total mystery. Over all the centuries before, no one knew the answer to the question, “Why do the stars shine?”The series of equations Bethe formulated explained the scientific basis for stellar energy production. The reactions he described involve thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium which releases an enormous amount of energy based on the Einstein formula E=MC2. For this work, Hans Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1967.As far back as 1938, the idea of building a generator based on fusion was being discussed and after World War II, research in fusion power accelerated. However, it was not long before scientists began to realize that artificial fusion was considerably more difficult than making a fission reactor. Nuclear fusion is possible in stars because the combination heat and immense gravity brings nuclei in close enough proximity that the electrostatic Coulomb Barrier, which keeps atoms apart, can be overcome. At that point, the strong nuclear force ( this being the fundamental force that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus), predominates and fusion can then take place via Quantum Tunnelling.Beginning in the 1950s, physicists and engineers began efforts to develop a terrestrial generator based on Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion,(CTNF) that would replicate what stars do naturally. It was well known that fusion of light nuclei like hydrogen was capable of producing an amount of energy 3 orders of magnitude greater than the opposite process of fission using very heavy elements such as uranium. Moreover, CTNF does not create high level radioactive waste and the essential fuel for a fusion device is Deuterium ( heavy hydrogen) which can be extracted from sea water. Our oceans contain an approximate 50 million year supply of this fuel.After several decades of research into CTNF, scientists became aware of the enormous complexity involved in the development of a terrestrial fusion machine. CTNF on Earth requires the use of much higher temperatures ( far greater than that found in the Sun), on the order of 150 million degrees Celsius.The past 50 years of fusion research has been focused on devising a mechanism to hold active plasma at this high temperature in an apparatus for long enough to generate usable energy.Given that it is impossible to create a gravitational field on Earth that would approximate that which is present in a star, a correlate had to be devised. The entity that corresponds to gravity in artificial fusion studies is intensely powerful fields generated by superconductor magnets. ITER will utilize a 13 Tesla magnetic field. The concept is that with such a “magnetic bottle” it will be possible to contain , in a stable configuration, fusion plasma which is also sustainable. This difficulty involving plasma stability is perhaps the principle engineering and physics challenge that has made development of fusion a very slow process. Thermonuclear fusion can be started within an experimental machine known as Tokamak which is a toroidal ( doughnut shaped) chamber. The Deuterium - Tritium fuel is heated to the very high temperature which allows thermonuclear fusion to begin. However, as I have noted, the resulting plasma has to be held at that temperature to maintain continuous fusion long enough to generate usable energy.Over the past 30 years or so, it has become clear that an apparatus using the tokamak configuration offers the greatest potential for development of CTNF as a future method for generating energy. This approach is known as the“ Magnetic Confinement” method.Several experimental tokamak devices have been in operation around the world for the past 20 years. These have demonstrated that CTNF can be achieved. Yet, the active plasma can only be contained for brief periods of time that measure in seconds. In present day research machines which do not allow for sustained control, the temperature within the tokamak drops and the active plasma looses coherence and flickers out of existence. It is just as if one had blown out a candle. Thus , the essential problem to be solved is to discover a mechanism that allows one to maintain control of the fusion plasma for an extended period. I would not regard it as an understatement to say that stable plasma confinement is the last remaining obstacle standing in the way practical CTNF.As you are reading this commentary, there is an international group constructing a complex apparatus designed to verify that CTNF is possible. This is the ITER Consortium which is comprised of the European Union, United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Russia and China.ITER is an acronym for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. ITER is also the Latin word meaning The Way. This scientific project is going to pave the way for a new method of generating energy. Construction of ITER began in 2010 in Cadarche France. As of 6 June \2020, the installation was 69.3% of the way to full completion. When the apparatus is completed, the first plasma experiments will commence. On the current schedule, the date for initial operation of ITER is December \ 2025. The total cost, to be shared amongst the consortium, will be ~ $20 Billion.At full power, ITER is designed to generate 500 MW of excess power. Once this milestone is reached, the world will be on a direct path to a new source of energy. The way will be open to constructing commercial fusion power stations all across our planet.I have studied the subject of CTNF for the last 30 years out of an innate and profound interest. Within the past few years, in the midst of writing a novel, I have followed closely the ongoing research efforts. Taken together, my natural optimism for the future and my intuitional sense informs me that generation of energy via controlled fusion will be realized. I believe this will happen in my own lifetime. The advent of plentiful fusion based energy will profoundly alter the entire course of Human Civilization. I predict that, in time, the New World which emerges will be magnificent, prosperous and filled with wonders and advances beyond anything we can presently imagine.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,15.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nuclear-power-plants-meltdown

We could also create solar panels on the Moon. It’s useful for fabricating electronics because of the hard vacuum. There are some processes you can do on the Moon easily which would be hard to do on Earth because it is so difficult to get a sufficiently hard vacuum to do them.There are several books by Moon enthusiasts describing this in detail, how it would work.I did a summary of some of the main resources on the Moon for my Case for Moon first. The rest of this answer consists of extracts from the sectionVOLATILE RESOURCESWe have pretty good evidence now of ice at the poles, in permanently shadowed craters, thought to beIt's not a direct detection however, so there is still room for scepticism about it, as rough material would have the same radar signature as radar transparent ice. But craters that are rough when new, are rough both inside and outside the crater rim. While these signatures are found only inside the craters and not outside the rims, which they interpret as meaning that they are caused by ice. The temperatures are also right for ice.If it is ice, it could be ""fluffy ice"".""We do not know the physical characteristics of this ice—solid, dense ice, or “fairy castle”—snow-like ice would have similar radar properties. In possible support of the latter, the low radar albedo and lower than typical CPR values for nonanomalous terrain near the polar craters are 0.2–0.3, somewhat lower than normal for the nonpolar highlands terrain of the Moon and are suggesting the presence of a low density, “fluffy” surface.""In either case, it is not just a little ice; if this is what they detected, there's estimated to be at leastIt also contains other volatiles. We know for sure that there is some ice on the Moon, by the LCROSS impact experiment. Relative to H2O at 100% they foundSo, if the rest of the ice at the poles has a similar constitution to the impact site that's a lot of nitrogen (in the ammonia) and CO2on the Moon at the poles.On the other hand, caution is needed as this is not direct detection. TheLEND mapThey did detect hydrogen, but puzzlingly, it was not correlated with the permanently shadowed regionsAThe Moon may also have ice at lower latitudes too, as there are permanently shaded regions up to 58 degrees from the poles (only 32 degrees from the equator). Though these regions are too warm to have ice on the surface, there may be ice there underground. SeeAt any rate, the Moon does seem to have resources of ice at the poles (though memorably, Patrick Moore in one of the last Sky at Night programs that he did said that he'd believe there is ice at the poles when someone brought him a glass of water from the Moon). More research is needed to find out how much there is and where it is.METALSCritics often say that the Moon is undifferentiated and doesn't have any processes to concentrate ores. Although the Moon doesn't have any liquid water so all the processes involving concentration of resources through water erosion won't work, it still has many processes that can concentrate ores. Including:The Moon has many valuable ores for metals. For instance, the highland regions (probably the original crust of th Moon) consists mainly of Anorthite (a form of feldspar, formula CaAl2Si2O8) which is 20% Aluminium, compared with 25% Aluminium for Bauxite on Earth. So aluminium ores are abundant on the Moon, indeed orders of magnitude more abundant than they are in typical asteroids, but it does require a lot of energy to extract the aluminium from the ore. Either a nuclear power plant or large areas of solar panels.""Aluminium (Al) is another potentially useful metal, with a concentration in lunar highland regoliths (typically10-18 wt%) that is orders of magnitude higher than occurs in likely asteroidal sources (i.e. ~1 wt% in carbonaceous and ordinary chondtites, and <0.01 wt% in iron meteorites; . It follows that, as for Ti, the Moon may become the preferred source for Al in cis-lunar space. Extraction of Al will require breaking down anorthitic plagioclase (CaAl2Si2O8), which is ubiquitous in the lunar highlands, but this will be energy intensive (e.g. via magma electrolysis or carbothermal reduction; Alternative, possibly less energy intensive, processes include the fluoridation process proposed by Landis , acid digestion of regolith to produce pure oxides followed by reduction of Al2O3 (Duke et al.), or a variant of the molten salt electrochemical process described by Schwandt et aMining this for the aluminium would create calcium as a byproduct, which is useful as a conductor in vacuum conditions, a better conductor than copper weight for weight -""Calcium metal is not used as a conductor on Earth simply because calcium burns spontaneously when it comes in contact with oxygen (much like the pure magnesium metal in camera flashbulbs). But in vacuum environments in space, calcium becomes attractive.""Calcium is a better electrical conductor than both aluminum and copper. Calcium's conductivity also holds up better against heating. A couple of figures mining engineer David Kuck pulled out of the scientific literature: ""At [20C, 68F], calcium will conduct 16.7% more electricity than aluminum, and at [100C, 212F] it will conduct 21.6% more electricity through one centimeter length and one gram mass of the respective metal."" Compared to copper, calcium will conduct two and a half times as much electricity at 20C, 68F, and 297% as much at 100C, 212F.""Like copper, calcium metal is easy to work with. It is easily shaped and molded, machined, extruded into wire, pressed, and hammered.""As would be expected of a highland element, calcium is lightweight, roughly half the density of aluminum. However, calcium is not a good construction material because it is not strong. Calcium also sublimes (evaporates) slowly in vacuum, so it may be necessary to coat calcium parts to prevent the calcium from slowly coating other important surfaces like mirrors. In fact, calcium is sometimes used to deoxidize some metal surfaces. Calcium doesn't melt until 845C (1553F).""Utilization of lunar materials will see the introduction of industrial applications of calcium metal in space.""From the section onThe Moon is deficient in copper, at least on the basis of what is known so far, but as well as calcium, aluminium is a good conductor.The LCROSS experiment found silver (a superb conductor) and mercury at the impact site, but the concentration is not known, except that it is far higher than the levels in the Apollo samples, and is probably in a layer below the surface, as the signal was delayed. SeeIt has abundant iron - in addition to ores (which would need a lot of power to extract), it actually has free iron metalIt's in powder form already, and naturally alloyed with nickel and cobalt. The blebs, or ""nanophase iron"" are found inside impact glass particles, so would be hard to extract. The rest though is made up of tiny particles of pure iron, so the obvious thing to try to do is to separate them out using powerful magnets. They are rather small though, most are less than a micron in diameter which could be a challenge. If we can separate them out, we can get five kilograms of iron, 300 grams of nickel and about half a gram of platinum, gold etc. (platinum group metals) in every cubic meter of regolith - as pure metal what's more. (This summarizes part ofHe bases that on aHowever we don't need to speculate any more as Jayashree Sridhar et al of the NASA Johnson Space Center have done the experiment using actual samples of lunar regolith. See""Experimental results indicate promise for the extraction of meteoritic metals from lunar regolith. However, more work is needed to refine the technique and understand more about the variables that affected our results.""The iron is valuable for steel, and is also a conductor, though not nearly as good as Aluminium or Calcium. It would be useful for some applications such as electric railroads on Mars, and is a conductor easy to access in the early stages.Also nickel and iron are useful for making nickel / iron batteries. These could be useful for making batteries on the Moon with in situ resources, for instance to help last through the lunar night.""Iron-nickel batteries are very rugged. Their lifetimes which can exceed 20 years are not affected by heat, cold or deep cycling. They are not easily damaged by rapid discharging or over-charging. On the downside, they have poor performance at low temperatures but they can be kept warm with insulation (e.g. simple regolith) and thermal wadis. Also, they only have a charge to discharge efficiency of 65% and will self discharge at the rate of 20% to 40% per month. Despite these shortcomings, they might be the Moon-made power storage systems of choice due to their simplicity and the availability of their component materials on the Moon. Moreover, these materials are among the easiest of materials to produce on the Moon.""Then, you also have titanium. This is especially interesting as it is rare in asteroids. Apollo 17 samples are 20% high purity Ilmenite, a Titanium ore which is found in the lunar mare. And better than that, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, with its spectral mapping of the Moon, discovered deposits that are up to 10% titanium, more than ten times higher than titanium ores on Earth. (Titanium is also widely used in medicine for hip replacements, dental implants, etc., asTitanium isCrawford writes (page 17)""Therefore, in the context of a future space economy, the Moon may have a significant advantage over asteroids as a source of Ti. The fact that oxygen is also produced as a result of Ti production from ilmenite could make combined Ti/O2 production one of the more economically attractive future industries on the Moon.For more on this, seeSo, yes, there are plenty of metals on the Moon, but it might take a lot of power to extract them, apart from the iron, if that can be separated out using magnets.And that's mainly based on the Apollo results which explored a small region of the lunar surface which has been found to be in some ways unrepresentative. The Moon may have many other surprises in store. Many ores on Earth would not be detected from orbit, and it seems the Moon has a fairly complex geology as well.As an example of one way the Moon could surprise us - Earth is often hit by iron meteorites, so the Moon should be also. The main question is, how Dennis Wingo has hypothesized in his Moonrush book, that the Moon may also have valuableTaking this further, there's a hypothesis by Wieczorek et al that magnetic anomalies on the Moon around the south pole Aitken basin may be from the remains of the metal core of a large 110 km diameter differentiated asteroid that hit the Moon to form the basin. If so, they could be useful sources for platinum, gold, etc.From Wieczorek et al, the North and South poles are marked N and S. Notice the magnetic anomalies clustered around part of the rim of the South Pole Aitken Basin. This is thought to be the result of an impact by a 110 km diameter asteroid. Wieczorek et al hypothesize that the magnetic anomalies trace out the remains of the metal core of this asteroid. If so these could be rich ores, including iron, nickel, also platinum and other platinum group metals (gold, rhodium etc). See page 16 of Crawford'sPlatinum is a particularly useful metal. It is heavy, soft, malleable as gold and silver, easy to draw into wires, very unreactive, and has a high melting point.The platinum group metals might be valuable enough to return to Earth from the Moon, just as suggested for the asteroids, especially if there is water to split and use as fuel available on the Moon or once they set up a mass driver on the MooOf course, you can't just take the current market value of platinum, multiply by the amount of platinum available in a large meteorite - or on the Moon if Wingo and Wieczorek et al are right - and conclude that you'd get trillions of dollars by returning all that platinum to Earth and selling it here. You need to fulfill a need or eventually nobody will buy it. If it's just to replace copper, for instance, in wires, it wouldn't be worth returning unless you could reduce the transport cost back to Earth right down. Dennis Wingo suggested in Moonrush that it could be worth exporting it to Earth for use for fuel cells, as an application that could be high value and yet need a lot of platinum.The gold could be useful too, on the Moon at least. You don't normally think of gold as more decorative than useful but it is used a fair bit in electronics Also combined with the abundant titanium on the Moon you get(density of titanium: 4.43 g/cc. using the atomic masses of gold and titanium, multiplying byThe paper focuses on its medical applications, you can alloy titanium with copper or silver, which are twice as hard as pure titanium, but this is four times as hard. It's also 70% more resistant to wear which will make it last longer and lead to less debris. And has excellent biocompatibility properties. But I wonder if it might also have lunar applications, with the hardness especially and resistance to wear.Probably only the platinum group metals would be worth returning to Earth, since it's going to be easier to mine the Near Earth Asteroids, especially the ones that consist almost entirely of pure metal. However, whether or not they are useful for Earth, they are well worth using on the lunar surface once you have industry there.The Moon has some advantages over Mars indeed for metals, such as the pure nanophase iron mixed in with the regolith, which can only exist in oxidized form on Mars except for rare metal meteorites. Also, it's unlikely it will be commercially worthwhile to return metals from Mars while there are definite possibilities of returning metals from the Moon. SeeLUNAR GLASSThis is a beneficial side effect of all the micrometeorite impacts on the Moon (which you don't get so much on Mars with its thin atmosphere, just enough to filter out micrometeorites). The Moon's ""soil"" or regolith contains large quantities of glass, created during the impacts. It also has free iron, as we saw, at half of one percent of the soil, in tiny micro beads of iron (nanophase iron) which concentrate the microwave energy. Again, you don't have this on Mars.As a result, it is really fast to melt the regolith using microwaves. It took only 30 seconds to melt small lunar sample at 250 watts (typical of a domestic microwave). You can melt the soil to glass as easily as you can boil water using the microwave in your kitchen. SeeHis idea (see Products from Microwave Processing of Lunar Soil on page 194 ofSee alsoThen, there's Behrokh Khoshnevis' idea for making a landing pad on the Moon using tiles made of lunar glass in situ. The idea is to make the surface into lots of tiles by injecting a material that can't be sintered easily using microwaves into the soil first to outline the edges of the tiles, then use microwaves to melt the soil in between.This would make a tiled flat surface for supply vessels to land on. It would also help with the problem of lunar dust by removing dust from the landing area. You canSOLAR CELLS FROM LUNAR MATERIALS - SOLAR PANEL PAVING ROBOTOnce you have glass, it might not be such a big step to make photovoltaic cells on the Moon. And here the Moon has one big advantage, the high grade vacuum so you could use vacuum deposition to make the cells in situ. To start with you'd make the cells themselves from materials sent from Earth, later on mine them on the Moon.This is a report from the Center for Advanced Materials at the University of Houston, suggesting the possibility of anIt would use silicon extracted from lunar materials to make the cells themselves. Of the various methods you could use, magma electrolysis may be best. He uses low efficiency silicon cells which are vacuum deposited on glass, something that is not easy to do on Earth but would be possible in the ultra high vacuum conditions on the Moon. Techy details of this suggestion areIt would requireIdea for a robot to drive over the surface of the Moon leaving solar panels in its wakeStructure of the panelsFor making glass on the Moon see the section above:BASALT (LIKE GLASS FIBER)The basalt itself is a natural resource. If reasonably pure and consistent in composition, it's ideal for making basalt fibre, which is like glass wool, but much better in some ways. The regolith consists mainly of powdered basalt. So might well be ideal for making basalt fibre. See:HELIUM 3I should mention this, since the topic is brought up so often in discussions of lunar settlement. However I don't see this as a major plus point for the Moon at present.The Moon is a source for helium 3, deposited in the regolith by the solar wind, andHowever, we don't yet have fusion power plants at all, and one able to use helium 3 is a tougher challenge. Frank Close wrote an article in 2007See alsoHowever if you use electrostatic confinement, a bit like a spherical cathode ray tube with the fusion happening at the center where the negatively charged ""virtual cathode"" is, then the particles are all at the same high energy and the result is much more feasible with lower power requirements. This is theGerald Kulcinski who has developed a small demonstration electrostatic 3He 3He reactor 10 cm in diameter. It is far from break-even at present, producing 1 milliwatt of power output for each kilowatt of input. SeePerhaps this line of development will come to something. Perhaps one way or another we will achieve helium 3 fusion as the enthusiasts for helium 3 mining on the Moon hope. However it is early days yet, and we can't yet depend on this based on a future technology that doesn't exist yet.However even if we do achieve helium 3 fusion, it might not be such a game changer for the lunar economy as you might think.Even more telling, he also calculates that covering a given area of the Moon with solar panels would generate as much energy in 7 years as you'd get from extracting all the Helium 3 from that region to a depth of three meters.Also - there are many other ideas being developed for nuclear fusion, such as laser fusion, and theThis doesn't mean that there is no point in helium 3 mining however. AsTHORIUM AND KREEP (POTASSIUM, PHOSPHORUS AND RARE EARTH ELEMENTS) ,AND SOME URANIUMThe MoonNuclear power stations built on the Moon wouldn't have the same pollution hazards and hazardous waste issues as stations on the Earth. Perhaps this may be a way to power space colonies, and interplanetary ships fueled from the Moon, so avoiding the need to launch nuclear power plants from Earth to orbit.Thorium is a tracer forWhen the Moon cooled down from the original molten state, then olivine and pyroxene crystals form first, and sink to the bottom of the magma ocean (both made of iron and/or magnesium plus silicon and oxygen). Meanwhile anorthite also forms (made of calcium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen), which is less dense and floats to the top (forming the lunar highlands). Some of the other elements like nickel are able to squeeze into the crystal lattice and get removed at the same time. But the larger elements can't, and are left in liquid state. They are last to solidify and form the KREEP deposits. It forms in between the olivine and pyroxene deep down, and the floating anorthite on top and may have been liquid for a long time.For some reason, not fully understood, then KREEP deposits on the surface of the Moon are concentrated on the near side of the Moon near the Imbrium basin, with a small amount also in a separate concentration on the far side. The Imbrium impactor probably excavated the KREEP deposits on the near side. But it's puzzling that the much larger Aitken basin didn't lead to large deposits on the far side. Perhaps for some reason KREEP is concentrated on the near side of the Moon. For more about this seeThe abundances of rare earth elements on the Moon are much less than rare earth ores on Earth, and despite the name, they aren't very rare here on Earth. So it's not likely that they'll be worth returning. However the most concentrated spots - the ones marked white in this figure - haven't been sampled on the surface and the spatial resolution is low, tens of kilometers. So it's possible we'll find more concentrated ores on the Moon.It's a similar situation for uranium and thorium. The abundances on the Moon from this map are too low to count even as a low grade ore on Earth. But with such low resolution, there could be richer ore deposits when we look at it closely. (Here I'm summarizing whatPOSSIBILITY OF USING LUNAR SOLAR POWER FOR EARTHThis is a bit further ahead, but it is worth thinking about, whether solar power for the Moon could actually be useful for Earth also. Some scientists think it could be.The advantage of doing this on the Moon is that you can use indigenous materials to make the solar panels. For a small amount of launch mass to the Moon you could have a rover that travels over the surface leaving solar panels in its wake. SeeIt's easy to see this working to supply power to the Moon, but some have suggested it could also be used to generate power on Earth. So, taking this even further, with a large scale operation of this type, using only 1% of the surface area of the Moon, you could supply 2 kilowatts of continuous power per person to a population of 10 billion on the Earth. SeeOr, further ahead, maybe this is more interesting as a talking point than a likely near future concept, the Japanese Shingzu corporation has suggested we could build solar panels in a band around the Moon - at the equatorSeeEarth would get solar power only half the day, so they send the power to satellites in orbit around Earth, which then beam it down to the other side of Earth. Of course they need large receivers to collect the power from the Moon, but only 1% of what they'd need to collect it directly from the sun - that could be worth doing if it is significantly easier to make solar panels on the Moon.On the other hand there are ideas to use large thin film solar panels in space or large thin film mirrors to concentrate the light onto solar panels or furnaces, launched from Earth to LEO. So would the lunar solar plants be a major saving compared to those?Another way that the Moon could help the Earth though, with solar power, is to make the solar cells from lunar materials, and then ship them to GEO or lower orbit. The idea of using lunar materials to make solar power satellites goes back at least to the 1970s, seeFor more on this see theWhether it is useful off planet depends a lot on how easy it is to export the materials from the Moon, and one of the most promising ways to do that is Hoyt’s cislunar tether system which exploits the Moon’s position as higher in the gravitational well than Earth to basically “roll the goods down hill” from the Moon to Earth through a system of rotating tethers.Seein my","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.4M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-viable-one-day-to-mine-the-Moon-and-extract-the-resources-there-for-something-useful

But after 90 years of development, further engine refinements aren’t expected to lead to major improvements in terms of thrust (these rockets are fundamentally limited by the energy held in chemical bonds).Litchfield argues that research in chemical rocketry should still constitute the major effort of NASA research, especially towards generating fuel at the destination planet, rather than carrying it all on board. For example, those on Mars might split ice from the polar caps into hydrogen and oxygen to use as rocket fuel.2. ElectrothermalThese engines use electrical energy to create a super-heated plasma and fire it through a supersonic nozzle to generate thrust.These kinds of engines have been used in Russian satellites since the 1970s and by Lockheed Martin A2100 satellites, using hydrazine as fuel. These engines are efficient, but the thrust they generate is extremely low, meaning their only likely use will be to orient satellites in orbit.3. Ion driveNow we're getting to the futuristic stuff. The ion drive engine is a thruster where molecules of an unreactive fuel, such as xenon, are given a positive or negative charge (""ionised"") and accelerated by an electric field to be shot out the back.The thrust is incredibly low, equivalent to the pressure exerted by a sheet of paper on the palm of your hand, so an ion engine is very slow to pick up speed. But over a long-range mission, the it can deliver 10 times as much thrust per kilogram of fuel as a chemical rocket.The Dawn spaceprobe, currently in orbit around dwarf planet Ceres (and responsible for the first striking photos of mysterious bright spots), used its ion drive to become the first spacecraft to enter and leave the orbits of multiple celestial bodies.4. Solar sailsParticles of light (called photons) carry momentum, like ping pong balls bounding off a wall. The solar sail idea is catch enough of them to pick up significant thrust.A spacecraft with a large enough sail could eventually reach incredible speeds without carrying any fuel.The concept was proved in 2010 when Japan’s project Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun (IKAROS) unfurled a 196-square-metre sail on a mission to Venus.Last year, the LightSail project showed this design can work on a shoestring budget.But as a solar sail moves away from the Sun, sunlight becomes feebler, and the available thrust decreases. More ambitious designs imagine travel to the nearest stars by firing a massive laser to fill the sail to power it through interstellar doldrums.5. Plasma propulsion engineThese engines are like high-octane versions of the ion drive. Instead of a non-reactive fuel, magnetic currents and electrical potentials accelerate ions in plasma to generate thrust. It’s an idea half a century old, but it’s not yet made it to space.The most powerful plasma rocket in the world is currently the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR), being developed by the Ad Astra Rocket Company in Texas. Ad Astra calculates it could power a spacecraft to Mars in 39 days.6. Thermal fissionA conventional fission reactor could heat a propellant to extremely high temperatures to generate thrust.Though no nuclear thermal rocket has yet flown, the concept came close to fruition in the 1960s and 1970s, with several designs built and tested on the ground in the US.The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) was deemed ready for integration into a spacecraft, before the Nixon administration shelved the idea of sending people to Mars and decimated the project's funding.7. Continuous fusionFusion-powered rockets effectively try to recreate the power of the Sun by super-heating fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees until the atomic nuclei fuse, and generate even more energy.A fusion rocket would be hundreds of times more efficient than the best chemical rocket. But a continuous fusion enginer hinges on achieving a net output from a fusion reactor, something that several decades of research, and a few billion dollars of research funding, have so far failed to do.8. Pulsed fusionPerhaps a more achievable way to use fusion power is to control detonation of a miniature fusion bomb to power a craft.One design, being pursued at the University of Washington, works by dropping a pellet of two hydrogen isotopes, surrounded by metal rings made of lithium, into a combustion chamber.At the right moment, a huge magnetic field slams the metal rings closed around the pellet, compressing the fuel to incredible pressures, leading to fusion. It’s a bit like how your car engine uses controlled explosions of gasoline.A grain of sand of this fusion material would the same energy content as four litres of rocket fuel. But a major problem with this research is that actually testing one would likely violate nuclear test ban treaties.9. NanospacecraftMost of the strategies for deep space transport involve building bigger and more powerful engines. But what about shrinking the spacecraft instead?In 2009 researchers at the University of Michigan developed kind of nanoscale engine that could be patterned onto a silicon chip. It works a bit like a tiny particle accelerator, very high velocities using simple electric fields between charged plates. Each chip could contain millions of tiny electric launchers.10. AntimatterAnd here we are: at the very end of the feasibility spectrum into the fantastic. Antimatter is made of antiparticles, which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but opposite charge and spin.Antimatter also has the highest energy density of any known substance. And if used as fuel, it could provide by far the most efficient propulsion system, with up to 40% of the fuel’s mass energy being converted directly into thrust (compared with 1% for fusion, the next most efficient).In 2006 the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) funded a team Gerald Smith of Positronics Research, designing an antimatter-powered spaceship. They calculated just 10 thousandths of a gram of antimatter would be enough to send a ship to Mars in 45 days.The problem is generating enough fuel.Antimatter is created in particle accelerators, but if all of the antimatter ever created to date were annihilated at once, it wouldn’t be energetic enough to even boil a cup of tea.Unless a source of this superfuel is found, antimatter engines will likely always remain in the realm of science fiction.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1K,9.4K,195.4M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-viable-one-day-to-mine-the-Moon-and-extract-the-resources-there-for-something-useful

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,14.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-have-uncontrolled-and-controlled-nuclear-fusion-at-the-same-time

When you have something so complex that it has a million components, the odds of it ever being economically viable in any earthbound generation perspective is vanishingly unlikely.After that, we get to the one GW. Nuclear reactors ended up standardizing around a GW for a variety of reasons, but mostly because that was a useful scale for boiling water to generate electricity. There were some smaller ones and some bigger ones, but the likelihood is that if we ever get fusion working economically to generate electricity, it will end up being in that scale. At 90% capacity factor, the nuclear industry average, it would generate about 7.9 TWh in a year, so that’s okay. There are about 450 nuclear reactors running in the 30 countries that built them generating around 10% of the electricity we currently use, so one fusion reactor would produce about 0.02% of the electricity we use globally.As for the all of it model, we have a really amazing fusion reactor parked ‘nearby’.

Even now the fuel cost is less than 2 cents per kilowatt hour. But the rest of the costs are from 30 to 50 cents in addition to the fuel. The plants started at 2 Billion/Milliard dollars, then 4, then 6, and for the 4 units the Obama Administration conned the utilities in Georgia and South Carolina, 8 and still rising, while the general contractor has bankrupted.For a short time I had a temporary job for Diablo Canyon with 2 units.

U238 is known as a fertile material. Thorium 232 is also fertile. It produces Uranium 233 when bombarded. Thorium is more abundant than Uranium, and U233 is not especially good at making bombs out of, so people have proposed using Thorium as the next big power source for that reason. People who build atomic bombs don’t particularly like the idea of shutting down power plants that could make bombs easily if need be. Reactors that convert fertile materials into fissile materials are called Breeder Reactors.Think of gathering wood for a fire in a rain storm. Some of the wood is dry most is wet. You carefully sort through the wet stuff in your tent and pull out the dry. You start a fire. You then stack the wet wood around the fire, and dry it.

Wastes can be processed by plasma extraction and a lot of them can be used in medicines and secondary power sources. That’s better than throwing them away mixed in with non radioactive materials. Anything radioactive could be blasted with a laser, the materials separated isotopically, and the pure materials used in a wide range of ways safely. In the end by the time we’re done with it, its less radioactive than the stuff we started with, we put it in a glass brick and drop it in a trench in the ocean.Westinghouse developed a high temperature sulphur iodine process that breaks water down into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be used to make carbon dioxide into carbon (coal) methane (natural gas) and octane (oil). It can also be burned. This process is 50% efficient. So, to make enough hydrogen requires 13,942.92 tonnes per year of Uranium to make enough hydrogen to replace all the fossil fuels we use. Since were extracting Uranium from sea water we can use the waste heat to make fresh water enough for everyone.Fusion reactors have been built. They’re called hydrogen bombs. They consist of Lithium-6 which is 7.5% of all naturally occurring Lithium. Lithium-7 is the balance - and Deuterium also known as Hydrogen-2 with an extra neutron. 1 in 3180 hydrogen atoms is Deuterium on Earth. As in the case of Uranium there is enough Lithium-6 and Deuterium dissolved in the ocean to keep a fusion reaction running using this process - called the Jetter Cycle after Ulrich Jetter who discovered it in 1947. In 1952 the first Hydrogen Bomb was detonated. The process remains secret largely but we start with neutrons bombarding Lithium-6 and that makes energetic tritium along with helium. That tritium hits deuterium and makes helium and you get your neutron back. So basically you put lithium-6 deuteride into a molten salt reactor and mix it with stuff like Beryllium that makes neutrons from alpha particles and Boron that makes alpha particles from neutrons and you have a nice little reactor without high temperatures and pressures. This was rumoured to be one of the products of Project Sherwood back in the 1950s. Though that is not open right now.Of course we can use hot fusion techniques to fuse Lithium6 and Deuterium as well.207.156 trillion joules of energy are released for each 750 grams of Lithium 6 and 250 grams of Deuterium. So,5.528*10^20/207.156*10^12 = 2668.52 tonnes per year. Double this to make hydrogen as before and fresh water. Self fuelled from the ocean. Waste product is helium. No long lived actinides to process — also no nuclear medicines, radioisotope generators and other useful things — so I see a mix of reactors being most beneficial.100 floating platforms off the coast of every country, begin opration. 20 of them are fission. 80 of them are fusion.

National City Lines [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy ] - Phillips Petroleum and General Motors colluded to buy up the tram lines and interurban lines across America and run them out of business in order to sell more motorcars. Studies done at the time showed that 2/3 of post war America would never buy cars if they had easy access to street cars and interurban for less cost. They also showed that electrically driven trams powered by power lines running over the tracks would always be less expensive than individual motorcars with complex internal combustion engines. The investment in and crashing of the tram and interurban system of the USA would triple auto and fuel sales and was well worth the losses incurred.On Nov 1, 1952, the US Atomic Energy Commission in conjunction with the US Department of Defence detonated the first hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike [ https://youtu.be/h7vyKDcSTaE ].This bomb used lithium-6 and deuterium to promote the Jetter Cycle. [ https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdf ] Here neutron flux was used to convert Lithium-6 to Tritium and Helium releasing 4.8 MeV of energy. The energetic Tritium scattered off the Lithium-6 remaining and fused readily with the Deuterium producing another alpha particle (Helium) and an energetic neutron. The neutron can interact with any of a variety of heavy nuclei to produce many more slow neutrons to create a large reaction from a small spark.By March 1, 1954 a ‘dry’ hydrogen bomb was detonated, Castle Bravo [ https://youtu.be/b5tmkna-k-U ]. Here the system was made very compact and easier to build.By 1956 a ‘fission free’ hydrogen bomb billed at the ‘Humanitarian H-bomb” because of its lack of radioactive fall out which used only lithium-6 deuterium was built.At that time people wondered if it might be possible to build tiny fission free ‘nuclear hand grenades [ http://media.restraint.org/2009/03/fusion_microcapsule.jpg ]’ that would be detonated in a thrust chamber to produce rocket thrust for a massive interplanetary rocket [ https://youtu.be/xYoLcJuBtOw ], others wondered if it might be possible to contain the jet of plasma in such a way to produce electricity directly using MHD with these inertial confinement [ https://www.nap.edu/read/18288/chapter/4 ] units.By 1954 Lewis Strauss, Atomic Energy Commission chair, reported to the public on the results of classified research associated with Project Sherwood a wide ranging study of fusion technology.

In 1848 Gage had a 43-inch tamping iron blast through his head, entering his left cheek and exiting out of the top of his head. He lived to tell the tale, and worked as a stage coach driver. The area of the brain that got damaged in Gage’s case was the left frontal lobe. He did however have major personality changes. He was ill-tempered, proliferous in his use of profanity, no longer stuck with plans, and treated others poorly. Gage’s friends found him “no longer Gage”.Image:Image: Images in clinical medicine. The tale of Phineas Gage, digitally remastered.Removing parts of the brain does not result in the consequences we expect. The brain has an amazing ability to rewire itself to perform completely different tasks when necessary. Bradley Schlaggar, a pediatric neurologist, transplanted the visual cortex from an embryonic rat’s brain into the brain of a newborn rat, in the area of the somatosensory cortex (responsible for such bodily sensations as pressure and temperature). Once the rat was an adult, autopsy revealed that the transplanted visual cortex was operating as the somatosensory cortex.Leah Krubitzer, a professor of psychology, performed a different experiment which demonstrated this amazing ability of the brain. She removed large pieces of brain in newborn marsupials. Autopsy of the marsupial adults revealed their brains had adjusted by creating the identical structures, in the same areas as a normal brain, but they were smaller so as to fit into the tinier space.Left and Right Brain HemispheresSo let’s start with removing a hemisphere (half the brain). It is hard to believe that we can even live with half a brain. However Elena del Peral does and unless she told you she had half a brain you would not know. She is a friendly, bright, fit young woman who attends college and works at a childhood cancer foundation and is on the dean’s list.Image:In utero she suffered a left-sided congenital stroke. She was diagnosed because she began to suffer severe seizures due to the fact that the diseased tissue from her left hemisphere was sending electric storms across her corpus callosum (the part of the brain that allows for left and right hemisphere communication). The doctors decided to perform a hemisphectomy (removing half of her brain).So what does the research tell us about removing half a brain? Studies of intelligence and behaviour were made before, and after hemispherectomy for infantile hemiplegia. Results showed that patients made gains in intelligence after loss of half of the brain, however behavioural changes occurred and remained consistent over many years.Image source: www.cartoonaday.comRight Hemispheric DamageLeft Hemispheric DamageSo let’s look at damage or removal at some of the major parts of the brain:Cerebral CortexThe cerebral cortex is the outer layer of tissue that covers the cerebrum (the part of the brain that includes the frontal, occipital, temporal and parietal lobes). It is composed of grey matter (mostly cell bodies), as opposed to the white matter below it (myelin sheaths of neuronal axons). It is highly folded, resulting in a much greater volume of the brain surface area in the confined volume of the skull. The corpus callosum (a thick band of nerves) connects the right and left cerebral cortex sides.Below are images of the lateral and medial areas of the cerebral cortex.Image: Lateral surface of the cerebral cortexThe cerebral cortex is responsible for most “higher order” or intellectual brain functions: thinking, reasoning, judging, planning, voluntary movement, and overall behavior.Injury to this area of the brain impairs judgment, dramatically changes personality, and results in problems with behavioural inhibition, focus and attention.Image: Medial surface of the cerebral cortexThe cortex has three distinct parts:Thus damage or loss of this particular area of the brain results in specific losses associated with the area of the cortex described above.ASource: London Natural History Museum:Cerebral Cortex FunctionsCerebral Cortex Injury ProblemsFrontal lobe:Image courtesy:The frontal lobe is responsible for helping us understand the thinking and experiences of others, and helping a person understand how to respond and behave appropriately in social situations. In autism and chronic post traumatic stress disorder the highway between the limbic system and the frontal lobe does not function properly. This results in a weak theory of mind for autistics, and an inability to process and let go of the trauma for people with PTSD.Image: James FallonThe frontal lobe has been divided into “cool” cognitive aspects of executive functions, (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and the “hot” emotional/motivational aspects, (ventral and medial regions).Damage to the the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex results in disturbances in intellectual abilities (intelligence) such as problems in time-line sequencing of behaviour, problem solving challenges, problems in planning, and working memory defects (known as metacognitive executive dysfunction syndrome).Damage to the ventro-medial region results in impairment in being able to inhibit impulses— both emotions and behaviour.Image:Damage or removal of this area of the brain is known as Dysexecutive syndrome. This results in deficits in recognizing facial and vocal emotional expression (which supports the weak Theory of Mind in people with autism spectrum disorder).Furthermore, executive skills are reduced. For example, research has looked at set-shifting ability in neurosurgical patients with localized excisions of the frontal lobes. The patients had a deficit in the ability to shift their attention from something that had previously commanded their attention, or to move to something which had previously been irrelevant.Frontal Lobe FunctionsFrontal Lobe Injury ComplicationsTemporal LobeImage courtesy:A temporal lobe resection is a surgery performed on the brain to control seizures. The procedure involves removing brain tissue in the lobe to remove the seizure focus. Most often the anterior and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are involved.Kolb & Wishaw (1990) have identified eight principle symptoms of temporal lobe damage:Occipital LobesImage courtesy:Located at the back of the brain—and thus are not particularly vulnerable to injury—the occipital lobes receive and process visual information. The occipital lobes also process colours and shapes. Whereas the right occipital lobe interprets images from the left visual space, the left occipital lobe interprets images from the right visual space. Damage to the occipital lobes can permanently damage visual perception.The Peristriate region of the occipital lobe is involved in visuospatial processing, discrimination of movement, and color discrimination.Occipital Lobe FunctionsOccipital Lobe Injury ComplicationsParietal LobesImage courtesy:The parietal lobes can be divided into two functional regions:Individuals with damage to the parietal lobes often show striking deficits, such as abnormalities in body image and spatial relations. Parietal lobe damage disrupts shape, size and color identification, and distance perception.Left parietal lobeRight parietal lobeBi-lateral damageSpecial deficits (primarily to memory and personality) can occur if there is damage to theLeft parietal-temporalTheParietal Lobe FunctionsParietal Lobe Injury ComplicationsCerebellumImage courtesy:Known as the ‘little brain’, it manages movement (but does not initiate it), maintain posture and balance. It also controls fucntions like attention and language and the regulation of the fear and pleasure responses. It receives information from the sensory systems, spinal cord, and other parts of the brain, and uses it to coordinate movements. It allows a person to perform rapid and repetitive movements like running.You can live without a cerebellum. Some rare conditions exist calledCerebellar hypoplasiaCerebellar agenesis:Cerebellum Brain FunctionsCerebellum Injury ProblemsBrainstemImage courtesy:The brainstem is connected to the spinal cord, and is responsible for controls unconscious functions (respiration, digestion, and pulse). Three structures comprise the brainstem: the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The midbrain controls eye movement and focus. The pons sends signals back and forth between the cerebrum and cerebellum. The medulla oblongata controls respiration, blood pressure, pulse rate, and digestion.The brainstem is responsible for vital survival functions,thus damage is often fatal. People who survive brainstem injury usually require assistance with simple physical functions like breathing and regulating pulse.Brainstem FunctionsBrainstem Injury ProblemsSource:The Limbic system is primarily responsible for our emotional life, and has a lot to do with the formation of memories.Limbic SystemDamage to the Limbic system may cause:Corpus CallosumThe Corpus Callosum is the area of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres. It was well know due to Split Brain Syndrome, where it was cut to prevent severe epilepsy. Damage to the area interrupts the steady flow of information between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. When cut it prevent the left hand from knowing what the right hand is doing and visa versa.And just for fun, you can test your self.

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it?

Often they used something cool called Core Rope Memory, your computer literally had its program hand woven into it, since this was much less bulky than read-write magnetic memory available at the time, though they incorporated a small amount of that as well.The lunar lander was intended to land very much on autopilot, however its computer became overloaded with the feedback from its rendezvous radar (left in standby in case they needed to abort) and nearly put them into a boulder leaving Neil Armstrong to take manual control and put it down safely.As for today, with computers so small, cheap and generally ubiquitous, practically everything is done by computer. About the only instance of manual control during a mission critical area that I can think of was during the testing of the space shuttle on mission STS-2 where deorbit and reentry where manually performed despite some fuel cell problems that otherwise cut the mission short.

You have investors who got in at the top of crypto last year, thinking it would go higher, and now they are in heavy losses, then you have people who got in early but get out too early.There is this ideology that as an investor, without too much knowledge you will always buy at the bottom and sell the exact top. Not only is this incorrect, but almost impossible.I am already seeing trends that larger institutes and pension funds, are already looking to invest in bitcoin and other smaller cryptos, like litecoin, ethereum and cheaper alt coins, but the regulation is not there yet for them to do this.

The jump between them is not a fast one, it is a slow one. It has taken us about 14 months to get to where we are now, so it would be safe to assume that it would take a minimum of 14 months (usually 2–3x that amount of time) to return to a positive and optimistic state.During that time price could do anything, however, it is unlikely to start going up, without stopping.As we talked about earlier, due to the excessive risk avoidance and inability to foresee a positive future, as the price starts to increase, instead of seeing the potential for more gains as investors did in 2017 they see the potential for more and violent losses.So they begin to sell out their positions because they see nothing but the potential for future losses. This, in turn, causes the market to falter, making more people sell their positions, and then it begins to reverse completely eating up all of the gains from the previous rally.This smaller cycle plays out a number of times within the larger cycle until there has been enough increase in the price for people to start to think “maybe this time will be different” and instead of selling out early, they hold on a little longer, just to see what happens.This is the tipping point back to a bullish trend.What you need to do to capitalize right nowThe TraderRight now Bitcoin is moving sideways with sharp bursts both up and down.

The British Pound was the reserve currency prior to the World Wars. The British Empire’s Pound was secured by an elaborate network of Imperial supply chains and backed by the might of the Royal Navy. This made the Pound an attractive currency to conduct international trade. It was almost guaranteed that if you did business through the British Pound, that your transactions would safely reach their foreign destination.World War I and II changed everything. The Germans employed a U-Boat strategy that quite effectively sunk more British ships than they could manufacture. Combined with the amount of money the British Empire borrowed to win the wars, they were forced to essentially sell their rights as a reserve currency to those damned Yanks, in exchange for supplies (and eventually an alliance).This handover of reserve currency status was solidified in the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement. Much less known about this agreement was the brutal disagreements occurring behind closed doors between the Americans and British. British Economist, John Maynard Keynes, and American Economist, Henry Morgenthau, had yelling matches about how to transition the postwar economic system. But the Americans had all the leverage in the negotiations, and they ultimately pushed their agenda forward.This became known as theThe Bretton Woods system is built on 4 pillars:2. Bribing up an alliance - The United States then offers3. Sanctions - Sanctions are when the United States is mad at someone, but doesn’t want to go to war with them. This is how the Soviet Union was dealt with, and a tactic used aggressively by the Trump administration. The US can choose to bribe all the other countries of the world to stop trading with a rival, under the threat they will cut their access off too. They do this by preventing all USD transactions to a specific country, and using their Navy to block direct supply routes to that nation. It effectively isolates the nation’s economy, making their economy extremely fragile. The Soviet Union only survived as long as they did because they had sufficient food, water and oil resources for self sustainability. Not everyone has that luxury. Which brings us to the last weapon the US has used, and was used, to bring down the Soviet Union.4. The PetroDollar - When China opened up its market to the US network in 1974, this allowed the United States to withdraw from Vietnam. The US then turned it’s focus to the Middle East, where massive oil fields were churning out enough energy for the entire global consumption. The US then established an agreement with the Saudis in the 1970s to exclusively trade their oil exclusively for US Dollars. In exchange, the United States promised to use its military to protect their interests. It was this agreement that allowed the US to drown the Soviet economy into submission (by flooding the global market with cheap Saudi oil). But the Catch 22, was that it was this agreement that has dragged the US to fighting a religious war they have no idea how to fight.Global reserve currencies are historically rare. Throughout history, currency domination was usually established by regional powers, such as the Roman, Persian, and Han Empires. It wasn’t until the British that one national currency went global. And their currency domination lasted for only 2 centuries (essentially from the Seven Years War to the end of World War II). This forced the British throughout this 200 year period (1763 to 1945) to get involved in just about every global conflict, since every global conflict affected the stability of their currency network.The British learned the hard way that while controlling the global currency was strategically expedient, it was ultimately unsustainable. They found themselves being forced to fight conflicts that weren’t directly in the interest of their own nation. In other words, they were forced to increasingly deploy their military when there wasn’t exactly a threat to their national security, but instead a threat to their currency stability. This was expensive, costly, and eventually dragged them into bankruptcy once Japan, Germany and Italy forced them to cash out on all their protection guarantees.While it is doubtful a foreign currency, or Bitcoin for that matter, will ever challenge the supremacy of the US Dollar (at least in the near future), it is possible that the responsibility of maintaining a global currency could jeopardize the financial well-being of the United States. It is an exhausting responsibility, with global headaches and annoyances. It is why since 1945 we’ve had soldiers fighting in rice paddies in Indochina, cocaine fields in Colombia, oil compounds in the Islamic world and the jungles of sub-Saharan Africa.Sometimes I think the British conned us in 1944 when they turned over the reserve currency.Those tricky bastards.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,3.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-Cryptocurrency-not-generating-out-of-thin-air-Why-it-is-valuable-if-it-can-be-mined-without-any-physical-restrictions-How-having-thousands-of-cryptocurrencies-having-billions-of-dollars-value-each-are-justifiable

Not the kind of person you need to explain ropes of a new technology.Soviet scientists offered to change the currents of the rivers in Siberia from north to south to ameliorate southern steppes and to drill a hole through the Earth to the antipodes, among other things, and also banned the science of genetics.American historian Simon Ings wrote, “Soviet science was at once the glory and the laughingstock of the intellectual world.”The Arctic in particular received a lot of attention from radical Soviet scientists who believed that there lay the key to man-made climate change (they erred on timeline and the method).Elon Musk would approve of this proposed bridge across the Bering Strait with two levels of rail tracks for super-fast trains to connect nowhere with nowhere.Block the Bering Strait that connects Alaska with Siberia with a dam to stop the discharge of warm waters from the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic, and bring English weather to the eastern coast of Chukotka. The length of the Bering Strait is 86 kilometers. For the purpose, cyclopean pumps would be built to pump water using nuclear energy through the dam.Soviet architect Kazimir Luchesky drew a plan for Beringov, a unique, one-of-a-kind Transcontinental Highway City. A cozy place with low-rises arranged in steps, to be visible from afar. He envisioned travelators - moving sidewalks, and electric cars.Evgeny Pastors, an enthusiast from Latvia, proposed sending 25 ships with “suitable power” to the Arctic to push all the ice into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, where it would melt. To speed up the process, Pastors came up with the idea of attaching sails made of tarpaulin to the ice floes to move them south with the fair wind.After the end of Great Patriotic War, Engineer Savinov suggested detonating a few dozen nukes across the Arctic Ocean to clear an ice-free passage for year round navigation.Soviet climate scientist Mikhail Budyko proposed to destroy the Arctic ice with soot, which should have strengthened absorbing properties. The ice would melt faster from solar heat and radiation. According to Budyko’s calculations the process would be irreversible.Additionally, special algae would be grown on a monomolecular film so that the water does not cool during evaporation.Dreamers push boundaries and eventually change the world.

It was designed by Shoji Kawamori, a qualified aerospace engineer and a modern doyenne of mecha anime. Is the VF-1 a jet fighter ? But of course !In form it is a smaller, single seat F-14 Tomcat, featuring thrust vectoring instead of rear flight surfaces - very avant-garde in 1982 !Delightfully, it too is a carrier-launched fighter, and the ‘hero’ fighter as flown by two of the main characters also features the famous skull-and-crossbones imagery of the US Navy fighter squadrons that have used this - VF-17, VF-61, VF-84 (who flew the F-14 at the time) and lately VFA-103 - The Jolly Rogers. In Macross they are known as ‘Skull Squadron’, a very suitable alternative label.Its also a fighting robot suit (and thus a Variable Fighter) and the reasons for this become apparent during the series - it is a military one….of course, this is not required for a space-borne jet fighter, but for a theoretical exercise, its a really well fleshed out one….Despite having gas turbine engines, they operate in space rather well. As Major Roy Fokker states to Hikaru Ichijo ‘With thermonuclear engines we can fly anywhere !’There is one fundamental permitting the Valkyrie in space, as an example of the concept : It literally has a thermonuclear fusion drive of very high specific output. In terms of propellant, such an engine can use anything as reaction mass - sea water, beer, Chanel No. 5, jet fuel, hydrogen - basically whatever is at hand. In Macross, the ship apparently snares some chunks of the rings of Saturn to use as its own reaction mass….This is the obstacle to making such a thing possible - we have literally no clue whatsoever on how to miniaturise this type of technology sufficiently to permit this kind of flight envelope.The Valkyrie itself is a fairly lyrical fantasy of fighter, in terms of its capacities - many of which we would need to solve - and cannot, as yet !* Made of a material called ‘hyper carbon’ provided by what turns out to be space alien technology gleaned from the ASS-1 (aka the Macross itself), its aircraft-thin skins apparently have the strength of main battle tank front armour !This is vital to the overall performance envelope of the craft, for combat - and transformation !They are also tapped for the computer controlled vernier thrusters in space which give the VF-1 the ability to be super manuverable in space combat - the beast can literally fly in the manner of an atmospheric fighter in space by these means.Where Star Wars fighters appear to do so ‘by magic’ which is not really acceptable to an enthusiast, the VF-1 at least has a solid reasoning behind its performance envelope.However, thanks to the American Space Shuttle program, a lot of the problems of ‘an aircraft in space’ have actually been solved !1. Aircraft tyres suitable for use in space have been developed and proved - this would be a significant consideration if it had not been solved.","99,875 followers",Alcatraz Dey,714,1.4K,68M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/How-much-work-would-it-take-to-modify-a-jet-fighter-to-be-able-to-function-in-outer-space

I wouldn’t go as far as saying this! I just can say I’ve written this question directly to Dassault and they never answered, in fact, they probably can’t answer themselves : at the present day, this material still hasn’t reached industrial production : it’s only made in small laboratories at astronomical costs, thus, mass production in factories has been added to the list of EU industrial priorities, then you have the politics and economical factors : if you end spending €1–2B per aircraft and you need 500 units to replace French, German and Spanish fighters, forget it, won’t happen!Other point making me think it to be feasible? France invented the Ramjet and the Mirage-III’s competitor, the Nord 1500 Griffon-II :already had a turbojet/ramjet combo engine in… 1957 !!!! You can see here how the turbojet was fit in the middle of the ramjet :Nord-Aviation was later merged with Sud-Aviation to create l’Aérospatiale, later renamed to its main product’s name, the Airbus.French are also accustomed at another type of dual propulsion : adding a rocket engine : using it, Mirage-III could reach 23,000m altitude or getting a serious boost when into a dogfight, this has surely helped more than once Israeli pilots facing MiG-21 which was supposed superior, at least on paper:In the early 50’s, French S.N.C.A.S.O came with the SO-9000 Trident as a supersonic jet fighter proposal. It had 2 turbojets on wingtipsand…An interesting project in the late 00’s is (was) the Adebaran space launcher to be used from a Rafale, in simple or trimaran versions :What is in fact interesting is… You have a 4t space-rocket, the trimaran weighting 12t (Rafale can take off with 12t under the 3 main hard points on condition to have only half internal fuel and do the complement from a tanker once airborne).From there, we can easily consider that, as FCAS is to be obviously bigger than Rafale, it may carry e.g. 4 of the Aldebaran 2 stages launchers, start by going hypersonic using ramjets, then use the 4 rockets to propel itself into space, moreover, the 1st stages may keep a little fuel and carry a warhead and the 2nd stage may carry a warhead too, so what allows you to enter space can also be used as weapon for space-borne strikes.Now, at the present day, what I’m writing here is pure Sci-Fi. All I do is pointing that if it is decided to make the Dassault/Airbus FCAS a “fighter plane [to] go to space”, since the necessary technologies are available and the two companies are no rookies when it comes to space-vehicles, added to the characteristics Dassault CEO spoke about, it is absolutely feasible for FCAS to become the 1st space-fighter, unless USA, Russia or China come with a “black-project”, and, again, at the present day, it’s banned by the SNT, but USA seems on the brink of violating the SNT due to the spread of A2/AD systems.

They also lacked targeting pods and precision guided munitions capable of achieving parity in terms of reliability compared to their western counterparts.An Su-27 Flanker:An F-16 Fighting Falcon :F-16 shooting down a moving drone with its Sidewinder missile:Edit: 1 k upvotes!

Including data of actual engagements, whenever these warplanes have seen use, which they often have, via 3rd party country stand offs.

Most of the damage should be localized to the US and those heavily dependant on it.On China’s side, they are on the rise. These tarrifs, bans, sanctions etc, are required for them to go through. It allows for a learning process and to ractify their weaknesses and dependancy issues. I’m quite sure China as a whole can withstand this and come out stronger than the US is currently in a few years. From here onwards, regardless of whether ZTE survives this, China will be looking into processes to close the loop on where they are lacking. And the chinese seldom repeats their mistakes.On another point, it’s not that the Chinese cannot retaliate to such bans effectively, they can. If the chinese really wants to retaliate in kind, they can just ban the sale of rare earth to the US or to the major chips manufacturer in the US. After all, they produce 90% of the world’s supply.Would the US have the ability to produce their own supply or find a cost effective subsititute if it comes to that? Sure they can, but just like how ZTE is affected, it will take quite awhile to have sufficient infrastructure and scale to do that. I estimate it to be about 5–7 years.

Now, it’s an easy sell.China also got rid of most its bubble in stock market and real estate. Especially the real estate, the private real estate providers in China all have USD debt. Because of the depreciation of CNY, those providers have been taking a huge hit. They have to refrain from fuming the real estate bubble in China.With some CNY depreciation, China was able to mitigate the stress on its export sector while at the same time get rid of its CNY debt. When Yuan depreciate, China exchanged USD to CNY to pay off all the CNY debt. The deleveraging process is almost completed by now. When the Yuan appreciate for a few month (the war was on hold at the time), China was able to exchange some CNY to USD and pay off some USD debt.US’s new visa policy also makes sure more talents are moving back to China. It is much easier for China to attract talented scientists and engineers. The provincial governors in China had been pulling out all kinds of tricks, from providing free housing and child-care to granting seed money to tax exemption. They are serious about hunting talents, and it’s working especially now that US is being such a dick.The Belt & Road program also got a great boost. Other countries are not only joining, but also taking initiative in designing and proposing new projects. Even Italy, a G7 member, signed on to Belt & Road this year.The internationalization of RMB was a tough going, because dollar worked so well before. Now, with all the sanctions and the trade barrier set up by US, it’s much easier to push for a second international currency. Since those countries are eager to import to China, they are starting to take RMB.What has the trade war did for US, so far?More bubbles in stock market and real estate.More national debt.Worse trade barriers with Canada, Mexico, EU, Japan and China.Worse sales in agriculture and oil.More debates between whatever parties and a gazillion democrats running for president.Some wake up call for US companies that instead of just being in China, they should have some part of their production lines in many different countries (anywhere except the high-labor cost counties like US), to mitigate the tariff risk.

It has become a kind of quadrennial tradition ever since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debate took centre stage in the 1992 election.Trump: “Our trading partners are cheating us, bilateral trade deficits are hurting the U.S. economy, U.S. negotiators have done a bad job with trade deals, and higher tariffs would help the U.S. economy.” Politicians often get criticized for flip-flopping, as they change their policy positions over time in an attempt to please voters or interest groups. On tariffs, Donald Trump has not flipped or flopped at all. As president, he is implementing the exact same policies he has talked about for years. Unfortunately, they are bad policies, based on a misreading of history and a misunderstanding of economics.In the 1800s, governments used tariffs as a primary source of revenue. Administratively, it was easiest to collect taxes on products as they entered a country, so for most countries tariffs were a main source of government funding. However, over the years governments found other alternatives, and tariffs as revenue became less important. Tariffs were also used to protect domestic industries. Other groups were hurt by this: U.S. consumers, who paid higher prices; and U.S. exporters, who were hit with retaliatory tariffs imposed by our trading partners. The infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs just after the start of the Great Depression disaster led Congress to delegate some of its power over trade to the president, so as to avoid constantly caving in to special interests. Giving the president more power over trade was successful for a while. However, there was a flaw: It only worked if the president supported trade liberalization. Most presidents did, at least to some degree, but now we have a president who genuinely believes it is good policy to give special interests what they want. Steel and aluminium producers get protection from competition; and farmers get subsidies to make up for the harms they suffer in the tariff war. All the while, consumers and taxpayers pay the price.Now we have testimony from farmers who are suffering from the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Mexico, Canada, the EU, China and others; manufacturers facing higher steel prices due to the Trump administration’s steel tariffs; and lower- and middle-class consumers who will soon notice price rises in their basic necessities as the administration’s tariffs on Chinese products increase. Tariffs encourage the deflection of trade to inefficient producers and the smuggling of goods to evade those tariffs; such distortions reduce welfare. Furthermore, consumers lose more from tariffs than producers gain, so there is deadweight loss. The redistributions associated with tariffs tend to create vested interests, so harms tend to persist. Broad-based protectionism can also provoke retaliation, which adds further costs in other markets. While the imposition of a tariff can reduce the flow of imports, it is unlikely to change the trade balance unless it fundamentally alters the balance of saving and investment. Tariff increases lead to declines of output and productivity in the medium term as well as increases in unemployment and inequality.In his writings, Navarro makes five distinctThe impossible-competition argumentIn ‘Death by China’, Navarro and Autry wrote that “China has stolen millions of American manufacturing jobs” and that “if we had held onto those jobs, America’s unemployment would be well below 5%.” In writing this they confounded macroeconomic factors and trade issues. In May 2016, five years after their book was published, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7%, and it has continued declining ever since. This is really scapegoating China. And during the same period, real U.S. income (real GDP) increased by 26%. All this occurred despite the worst recession since the Great Depression! The value of the goods imported from China is also often exaggerated. According to research done at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the proportion of American consumer expenditures that go to China, including the value of the Chinese inputs incorporated into what’s produced in America, is 1.9%. This is because Chinese goods occupy a big share only in relatively small categories of consumer expenditures (such as clothing and shoes, or furniture and household equipment), and because two-thirds of what Americans consume is composed of domestic services—such things as health care, education, and housing.Navarro’s “externality” argument is remarkably shoddy. Outcompeting producers is not technically an “externality,” but the normal result of a free and flexible economy where “creative destruction” occurs. If the result of competition is considered an externality, everything in economic life is an externality and the concept becomes useless. In the Schumpeterian world of Chinese commerce, it is death by competition for literally hundreds of start-ups within the country.The fairness argument: “Unfair” trade is not free trade and is destroying the American economy.Perhaps what people resent is competition based on allegedly unfair advantages that create a “non-level playing field.” This fairness argument may be the foundation of all other protectionist arguments, in the general public and among politicians. It’s an important argument that needs to be addressed. Intellectual property theft can be dealt with, through the WTO and ordinary courts, even Chinese courts. “American IP owners have in recent years enjoyed increased success in enforcing their rights in Chinese courts,” Stanford law professor Paul Goldstein has observed. Even the USA didn’t give a hoot about patents in its early years and up until 1989 when it decided to adhere to the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. From mid-2005 to late July 2018, the yuan increased in value 18% against the dollar, even counting the 8% drop since April 2018 when American protectionism started battering the Chinese currency. A national state cannot undervalue its currency for very long because doing so requires an increasing money supply, which generates domestic inflation and exerts an opposite effect on the currency.As for the lack of labor and environmental regulations in China, why should that be an issue? There were no such regulations in America and other Western countries when they started growing during the Industrial Revolution. Are rich Western producers (including trade unions) now going to dictate such regulations in developing countries? This sort of fairness looks rather self-serving and unfair.In general, low wages in poor countries are not “unfair.” It is because of their low wages that they have a comparative advantage in some economic sectors. Advanced countries have a comparative advantage in sectors more intensive in capital—including the human capital of specialized workers. This is a conclusion of the theory of comparative advantage that Navarro ignores. If the Chinese government is more mercantilist than the U.S. government, for whom is this unfair? Certainly not American consumers, who obtain cheaper goods thanks to the hapless Chinese taxpayers who pay the subsidies. It is not unfair for American consumers to get bargains on goods from China or other developing countries. It is not unfair to let private firms, wherever they are, compete to satisfy consumers. What is clearly unfair is to use the power of government to protect a small number of American producers, like the 2,400 American workers (at most) occupied in manufacturing washing machines, plus the shareholders (not all American) of the few domestic washer manufacturers, to the detriment of 97 million American households.The trade deficit argument: The U.S. trade deficit is a serious problem that reduces gross domestic product and indicates unfair trade.The trade deficit is a false problem originating from a faulty economic analysis, a statistical confusion, and a sort of logical prank. The economic error is to assume that a trade deficit is bad in itself. The United States had a regular trade deficit—or, more precisely, a merchandise deficit—until the Civil War, and a surplus during the Great Depression and the two world wars. There is nothing intrinsically bad about a global trade deficit, which implies that net foreign investment is coming into the country. Also, there is nothing intrinsically good in a trade surplus, which implies that net capital is leaving the country. A trade deficit, however, may be bad when as is currently the case in the United States, it is due mainly to high federal budget deficits that attract foreign purchases of Treasury bonds, but this cannot be attributed to the fault of foreign investors. The logical prank comes from begging the question, what is the problem with a trade deficit? It reveals unfair trade practices, answer protectionists. But how does a protectionist determine that trade is unfair? By observing that it results in a trade deficit! What sort of baloney is that?The retaliation argument: Retaliatory protectionist measures are justified against protectionist countries; such retaliators are the real free-traders.The retaliation argument claims that protectionism and retaliation against a mercantilist country actually promote “real” free trade. Some people go so far as to say that the protectionists in the Trump administration are free-traders at heart. Such beliefs are contradicted by their own actions as I illustrated in my answerSo we are now actually watching the effects of tariffs on domestic consumers, absolutely self-detrimental. Any trade is beneficial to all trading partners; otherwise, one party would walk away from the exchange. Individuals and private bodies should be left free to make their own bargains. The goal should not be to stop China from growing but, on the contrary, to not interfere with its people as they become richer and freer, just as Americans simultaneously do. Tariffs are short-term gains for politicians in exchange for economic pain, possibly long-term, for nearly everyone else, a standard result of government interventionism.The national security argument: Protectionism is required for reasons of national security.The national security argument is really just a protectionist excuse. If steel and aluminium are security issues, so are food and clothing – soldiers don’t fight naked and go hungry. It is trivially true that any foreign country that becomes richer could represent a more serious military threat because its government can extract or requisition more resources for war purposes. But it is no less true that wealthier people are likely to be less willing to go to war because they have more to lose economically. Thus trade can help prevent war. Making pariahs of the Chinese will harm, not improve, national security.But isn’t Chinese industrial policy a great threat? No. It is an error to believe, contra economic theory and history, that the controlled enterprises in a country dominated by a communist government can constitute a grave danger for efficient capitalist enterprises. The threat to the U.S. economy posed by the Japanese turned out to be greatly exaggerated. If China isn’t backsliding and its producers make advances in freedom and economic efficiency, then that is good for all of mankind.“Protecting” U.S. manufacturing is probably as outdated from a national security viewpoint as it is from a narrower economic viewpoint. Remember that in America as in other advanced countries, two-thirds of consumer expenditures are devoted to services. Another reason why the proportion of employment in the manufacturing sector has beenNavarro and his like-minded coterie are motivated by military fears and nationalist emotions. His arguments are not based on economic analysis. The trade deficit is caused by federal profligacy, in which case the solution is to solve the root cause of the problem. To obtain better results, one ought to apply a two-pronged approach: file complaints against China at the WTO under the various provisions that apply here (China is under greater obligations than most countries, as per the terms of its accession), and negotiate new rules in a multilateral agreement with China. An important part of the negotiation is that the United States and its allies have to be willing to give something. A one-sided deal is difficult for any country to accept, and this is certainly the case for China, given its history with unequal trade treaties with Western countries. For example, in exchange for China lowering its tariffs, the United States and its allies could agree to abandon the special, more onerous, calculation method used for China and a few other countries when setting anti-dumping duties. And recognising China as a market economy as promised. United States should also be negotiating trade liberalization directly with these same trading partners. The preferential trading arrangements that result would put China at a disadvantage and put pressure on it to liberalize. Unilateral tariffs have led to Chinese tariffs in response, but tariff liberalization could put pressure on China to pursue its own liberalization so as not to be at a disadvantage. That would have been a better strategy.It is possible to push China in the continued direction of reform. Think about the progress it has made since 1978. But reform in China will not happen with a trade policy that slaps tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and turns allies into foes.Thanks for A2A.","4,651 followers",Muhammed Borhanuddin,1K,148,16.4M,18.0,https://www.quora.com/How-much-work-would-it-take-to-modify-a-jet-fighter-to-be-able-to-function-in-outer-space

Gas is less than 5% of total monthly expenditures for most people, and when it goes up 50%, people tend to drive less, and in the end a 50% increase in gas prices probably hits the pocketbooks by about 2% at most.And yet…Granted, there are many other factors involved in the above, but do remember the graph in the article happens to be an economic boom time.Now we’re talking about increasing prices of every day goods by 15 - 25%How about China?One party system, where most people still remember starvation, have over 50% savings rate, very little personal debt, and where most people own their homes.Oh yah, they remember the Opium Wars, they remember Nanking, they remember being partially colonized by 8 different nations while their weak-handed government did nothing. 100 years of humiliation.Their national anthem literally says they will pave the way to tomorrow with their own blood and their own flesh.It’s a face-punching competition, the Chinese know what it means to lose one - and Americans don’t even know that’s what the competition is about.

Rather, it’s a clever placement of 2D figures on the screen, and following perspective lines, plus some limited 3D geometry (the road lines). This was applied to vehicles too, the typical availalble hardware had graphic cards supporting “sprites”, small rectangles where you could draw something and move it very quickly, thanks to the graphic card wired functionality. So, the driven car was animated by swapping 3/4 different sprites and the the effect of an incoming vehicle was rendered by showing sprites of the same vehicle drawn in different sizes and positions.At the time, it was absolutely impressive, especially considering that it was running on hardware that was thousand times less powerful than any nowadays smartphone. In fact, I still run it with my smartphone from time to time, and obviously it has no performance problem with it, as it is also able to do do much better with frameworks like Unity.Oh, and we had game rooms where these wonders could be played in a setup like this:Which is also common nowadays, but imagine you are 16 and you’ve never seen an almost-real Ferrari that you can drive before legal age…Another example I love of 3D that is actually 2D is this:It was named Fire Trap, you had to climb your fireman avatar by coordinating two joysticks.

She wanted to know what I looked like, and I had no access to a digital camera, but I remembered this picture from a few years ago on an FTP server somewhere. I downloaded the picture, and sent it to her.Keep in mind that both of us were accessing company Unix servers through text-only connections - I had a DEC VT-220 terminal and a modem - so neither of us had a way to look at pictures on our computers.The file was in an obscure format. I don't recall what format it was, but somehow between her and the geeks at her work, they managed to change it from something that looked like:etc.into something that looked like:which came off her printer. Since this was pre-WWW, I assume they found the software using gopher. And because printer and monitor resolutions were a lot lower back then, this was a full page picture.After that, she agreed to meet me at a neutral location, and after a few other adventures, we've been married 19 years.And that, my children, is how you got a picture of yourself to another geek in another city in the early 1990s.

While this is a noisy indicator, when the rate crosses above its MA, you should be checking your dashboard closely for other things which may signal a slowdown.

Simultaneously, he went on a military spending spree, all of which was funded by raising the national debt (deficit spending).Economic recession was the result.GW (War President) Bush enacts tax cuts for the rich and deregulates financial markets. Budget deficits are the predictable result. Instead of raising taxes, Bush just borrows the money to pay for the shortage which of course, adds to the National Debt. And he starts two unjustifiable wars, enormously costly, all of which is also added to the national debt.The worst financial collapse since the Great Depression of the 1930s, is the result.Trump enacts tax cuts for the rich. As expected, those tax cuts for the rich increase the National Debt by $1.5 Trillion or so. This in addition to a huge increase in our already bloated and unjustifiable military budget, is skyrocketing the National Debt to roughly $2 Trillion!!!!The economic disaster has not yet materialized, but it really doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that policies that have produced economic catastrophe every time they have been implemented in the past, will have exactly the same results in the present.The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, but expecting different results.

This is why dollar cost averaging is such an excellent strategy.But to make out you have to have a pile of money you can apply, and have great courage, a penchant for risk and the ability to wait it out. If you have no money then you cannot take advantage of the opportunity. “When there is blood in the streets, buy stock” is a famous quote that couldn’t possibly be more true.

When prices are low, people can invest and the stock market has always come back. This is why dollar cost averaging is such an excellent strategy.But to make out you have to have a pile of money you can apply, and have great courage, a penchant for risk and the ability to wait it out. If you have no money then you cannot take advantage of the opportunity. “When there is blood in the streets, buy stock” is a famous quote that couldn’t possibly be more true. When people are selling, selling, selling it’s the time to buy - if you are smart and do your homework and know how to buy.When there is a collapse, the rich suffer disproportionately but they are often also the best positioned to scoop up the scraps and make money. Stock market crashes have the same critical value that forest fires have - they create the opportunity for new life and new growth in the ashes. Rich people are more likely to have assets that can be used to scoop up bargain stocks.“No one ever bet enough on a winning horse” is a oft-stated quote when it comes to stock. If you buy a 1000 shares of xyz and it goes up 1000 percent, you wont be congratulating yourself; you’ll be cursing yourself for not buying 10000 shares. This is called “greed” and you must overcome it. Know when you’ve won and WALK AWAY. In fact, there are adages in stock market circles, “Sell in May, walk away” because the stock market is almost always moribund until September. Take your gains (or losses) AND FORGET THEM. You can never dwell on success or failure of the past; no one ever got successful in the past; “Coulda, shoulda, woulda are three guys I never want to know.” Forget the past.Also, have a plan and stick to the plan. Greed is the biggest killer of all. When you make a decision to sell at “X” then sell a “X” and if it goes up, forget it, and if it goes down, forget it. FORGET IT. Dwelling on “what could have been” is the strategy of LOSERS. “It’s never too late to make a losing bet” is another analogy. You have to know your strength and what you can stomach; just because a stock goes down doesn’t mean it can’t go to zero and there’s no guarantee it will go up. Know what you want and why you want it and what you’ll tolerate for price swings.I never recommend individual stocks other than Blue Chips that pay dividend such as Johnson and Johnson. I was caught up in the US Steel bankruptcy and lost a lot of money in the early 80s. I remember my broker telling me investing in US Steel was a “no brainer”. “You’ll be in the gravy”. Even a blue chip can fail. It did. I lost a house.In a financial crisis you have to keep your head; if you’re in SP 500 Index Funds, maintain your dollar cost averaging strategy and increase your monthly contributions as much as you can; if you have individual stocks and you believe in them, then hang on to them and see if they will recover; if you have stocks you should have a Plan such that if the stock goes down “x” percent you will sell it, regardless, and take your losses because you at least preserve some capital. No matter what, have a Plan.In a financial crisis where there is a hyper inflation, then people who invest in the stock market make out because in an inflation, the stock market tends to grow faster. Again, you have to have money to make money and holding money in an inflation is a waste. It has to go somewhere and that place is the stock market since bonds won’t help you in an inflation; TIPS protected investments might help as well.In a deflation, stockpile cash and don’t buy goods - their value simply decreases over time anyway. Deflations are a self-fulfilling failure because people put off buying expecting prices to collapse even further which creates a death spiral.In the upcoming collapse, which I predict will occur between September and December, cash will be king. I recommend to everyone to start stockpiling cash. If I am wrong and the economy doesn’t collapse (and I am often wrong) then you will have a pile of cash available for other things and that’s never a bad thing; but if there is a crash, then real estate, stocks and other securities will decline in value - perhaps rapidly - and having cash is the only safe thing to have. In a financial crisis other than inflation, cash is king.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,7.4K,5.6K,426.3M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/How-long-will-Bitcoin-exist

Yep.In the Apollo era, NASA officials were aware that the Soviets were, as many early scifi authors had foreseen, attempting to build a large rocket with a whole lotta little engines:NASA didn’t need to do this because they had the mighty F1, which the Air Force had started down the development process five years before NASA existed.So NASA officials liked to say that far from increasing redundancy as you would naively assume, having more engines just increased the chance of failure.Come again?Well this wasn’t entirely wrong.Is it safe that SpaceX puts 29 engines on its Super Heaver booster?

Having more engines does indeed increase the chance that one engine will fail, and if the failure of one engine has the result of damaging critical hardware nearby, that would be bad.That was the case, in fact, with the Soviet N1 rocket which had the unfortunate distinctions of having caused one of the largest non-nuclear explosion on Earth up to that time. But the N1 suffered from a number of handicaps that must be considered.First, the engines for the N1 were radically innovative, but designed and built in a hurry and on a relative shoe-string by a design bureau whose previous experience was limited to airplane engines. The American F1 on the other hand was modestly cutting edge maturation of the basic engine design used by the V2 rocket during the war and by Goddard before it. It was much bigger and better, but was not nearly as radical a leap, and it was started more than five years earlier and well funded.Second, the technology to adequately monitor and control the coordinated firing of so many engines simply did not yet exist. The Saturn had no more than five engines on any given stage, a much more manageable control problem in which even limited manual intervention was possible.Third, Soviet industry and engineering talent had been decimated by World War II and Stalin’s purges before it, and the repercussions from all that were far from mere history at the time the N1 was designed and constructed. At the same time, American industry and engineering talent had benefited immensely from the war, and multiple ways we Americans are far too eager to interpret as inherent superiority.So yeah…between the Saturn V and the N1, more engines definitely increased the odds of big rocket go BOOM! Which the N1 did time and time again.But at the very same time NASA was extolling the virtues of larger, fewer engines, combustion instability in the giant F1 was never fully understood or solved, and every Apollo launch prior to Apollo 14 experienced POGO oscillations potentially dangerous to the mission, and addressed by simply shutting the first and second center engines down early (and then earlier). Subsequent analysis suggests that at least as late as Apollo 13, the first stage center engine may have failed, and its only good fortune that prevented catastrophe.Also at the very same time, the FAA was requiring four engines on long distance trans-oceanic airliners, specifically for redundancy.A 707 or 747 can fly on two engines. Not well, but well enough to reach an airport. Of course, having four engines increases the odds that one of them will fail, and airliners have crashed in the past because of damage caused by the disintegration of or fire caused by a failed engine.That’s why since the late 1950s, most airplane have hung their engines in pods below the wings. This is inefficient, but it eases maintenance and increases isolation in the event of a failure. Over the years, manufacturers have also found ever more effective ways to shield engines with lightweight armor and enable them to fail gracefully instead of catastrophically in the even of damage in object ingestion.So now, half a century later, Space-X is building a Saturn class launch vehicle around a platform loaded with comparatively small, comparatively radical rocket engines, and you are more than justified to wonder, “is that safe?”Well, lets consider a few differences between then and now.Put all this together and yes, not only do I think its safe to put engines on a Super Heavy booster, I think it provides redundancy and a number of efficiency and other advantages.","35,110 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.1K,12.3K,142.4M,6.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Elon-Musk-proposing-a-plan-to-speed-up-spaceflight-to-Mars

I have seen this so many times in my almost 50 yrs. of life.But in all honesty, any martial that teaches you all of these ridiculous combinations to do and you don’t practice them hard sparring are useless. You’ll learn 1000’s of techniques in a style like Krav Maga but you don’t practice those because you are wearing gloves when you do spar or might not even spar at all. So, the hole poke to the eye technique with a chop to the throat and kick to the sisters is all fantasy and doesn’t work the same on one person as well as it might another. Steven Seagal learned this when he told Gene Lebell he could escape Genes rear naked choke and Steven pooped his pants. True story.When you see a Krap Maga martial artist get their ass kicked by a practical martial artist in JJJ/BJJJ or a boxer/Mui Thai fighter that is why. Techniques are simple to practice and easily mastered after a short amount of time.Believe it or not, martial arts can get you beat up even worse. A lot of places instill over confidence in people because they got their black belt in Krap Maga, and they go out and get whooped real bad by someone that just wrestled a few years or learned a few boxing techniques. Realistic technique works a lot better than advanced technique because you only have to practice them a few hundred times before they are practical.

In a real fight, there’s no such thing as “honor.” The opponent will do ANYTHING to win. The opponent isn’t going to bow and get into their stance, ready to fight. No, the opponent is going to actually fight dirty to win.If a traditional martial artist is going to bow in a street fight, the opponent isn’t going to bow. The opponent is going to see that as a sign of weakness, and strike first.I think the second reason why people don’t look fondly on traditional martial arts is2) Traditional martial artists can’t take hits.Now, in my opinion padding does help for beginners who are trying to learn how to fight. A good teacher wouldn’t just force people to attack the beginners without protection so the beginner can “man up” and be a badass.However, the problem is that most traditional martial artists don’t have padding, and can’t take hits. Most traditional martial artists are so used to the padding, that when they go in a real fight, the second they get hit by a rookie, they’re down for the count.You guys may think “oh, I can shake off a hit from someone. It’s a hit, I can handle it.”As someone who got in a fight one time in high school and only won by luck, I can gurantee you. Getting hit HURTS like hell. If the person is going to hit you in the arm, I can gurantee you that most of the public aren’t going to “shake off the pain.” No, most of us are going to only think about the throbbing pain, and will probably call off the fight.There’s a reason why the only sparring fights in martial arts I consider at least a bit better and closer to reality are these ones.Even though they’re wearing gloves, at least they’re not wearing armor like padding. It’s more accurate, and they can at least build more pain tolerance.People say that most traditional martial arts don’t allow “full contact” sparring, or heck most traditional martial arts don’t allow people to spar to know how its like in a fight.Most traditional martial artists don’t like to spar with other people because they can “hurt” their opponent. But modern fighters argue “Isn’t that the point of self-defense or at least martial arts? To teach people how to defend themselves and defeat the opponent so they won’t attack again.”That’s what I hear from most modern martial artists talk about traditional martial arts. Don’t know if its true, but it’s what I hear.The third reason why people don’t like Traditional Martial Arts3. They don’t really teach effective martial arts, or are mcdojosA McDojo is a school that only cares about money, and doesn’t teach people how to fight. Most traditional martial arts fall victim to mcdojos (although mma schools may have some mcdojos).But people keep on saying that traditional martial arts don’t really teach effective self defenseDoes anyone see the problem? The guy one the right could easily hook the guy on the left when the guy on the left is doing his “self-defense”.That’s the thing, most opponents wouldn’t just punch and let their fist hang in the air so the other person can do self defense. The opponent will not just do one move, and that’s it.(Don’t know if my answer will be collapsed for this) but look at this gifYou see that person with the boxing gloves? He’s not doing one move, and that's it. He’s doing multiple moves, and being unpredictable. Now, it might not be accurate to real fighing, but at least its better than the opponent doing one punch, and letting their fist hang in the air.That’s the problem most people have with traditional martial arts. In modern times, street fighters are going to do a combo move. They’re not going to keep on spamming the same move, or just do one move, and be done.Now, I may not be a great godly fighter like Chuck Norrisor a skilled martial artist like Bruce Lee or Donnie YenBut I can easily tell you that being in a fight is actually very scary. Movies make being in fights seem pretty badass, but trust me if you were in your first fight you might be scared out of your mind, and be unfocused.Now, I don’t really look down on any martial arts. If you think Tai-Chi is effective in martial arts, or Caiopera is effective in martial arts. Go ahead, it’s your opinion. I don’t have anything against thatHowever, to most people, traditional martial arts aren’t effective because they don’t teach people how to take an actual hit, rely on honor to win a fight, and have ineffective self-defense.",0 followers,John McGlothlin,943,3.1K,52M,17.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-safe-that-SpaceX-puts-29-engines-on-its-Super-Heavy-Booster

So loading a website takes AT LEAST 6 minutes.But when Earth and Mars are at their furthest, there is a 22 minute one-way radio trip…and a 44 minute round-trip.It’s actually even worse than that - when Earth and Mars are in opposition - the Sun is between the two and you can’t transmit any direct messages between them at all. Instead, there would have to be a satellite somewhere off to the side - which would increase the delay to an hour or more.Even if you’re really patient, most networks drop the connection if a reply doesn’t appear in a minute or so.All of this means that there is essentially no way to access the Earth Internet from Mars unless you’re prepared to spend weeks trying to get what you need.Most likely, Mars would have it’s own Internet - and the more important web sites would be copied to Mars when changes are made. But smaller, more obscure sites aren’t going to be able to do that - so the vast numbers of fascinating quirky places just won’t be reachable unless you plan days in advance.So you’d have fast access to (say) Wikipedia - but the pages you’d be able to read would be a day, a week, a month out of date.BANDWIDTH:These long delays are one problem - but another is overall bandwidth. If there are only a handful of people on Mars - then sending emails, texts and tweets back to Earth wouldn’t be a problem…but once you have thousands of people doing that - the radio link between Mars and Earth would soon become choked by the volume of data.At that point - you may be sharply limited in what you can send back to Earth.300 million miles is no easy gap to cross.MARS-NET:If SpaceX continues to play a major part in the colony - then it’s likely that they’d put StarLink satellites into Mars orbit - which could provide a GPS-like navigation service and fast Internet access over the entire planet.For talking to other people on Mars - accessing web sites on Mars - then there is really no reason why it shouldn’t be as fast as here on Earth.For large bulk data - it may be that we ship things like movies, TV shows and such with the resupply ships that’ll show up every 2.2 years. So a burst of new stuff arrives.CONCLUSION:Ultimately - it’s going to be tough for the culture of Earth and Mars to stay together. Sooner or later, there will be different memes on Mars - new social media - new web sites - that will scarcely interact with Earth web sites.When you can only talk easily with fellow Martians - they’ll be your friends - and you’ll stop needing to talk to Earth.Mars will start to use words differently - give it 100 years and who knows how wide the gulf will become.",146 followers,Nick Tresidder,2.1K,601,414.9K,0.0,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-will-the-Internet-be-on-Mars

This is in is in the previously mentioned 15-45 minute range.So, if you are sending the Great Martian Novel to your publisher on Earth, whoosh! it's sent in a second, takes a while (15-45 minutes) to get to Earth, and is received in a second. An indication that the data was successfully received is sent, which arrives after a while and indicates that the temporary copy of the data won't be needed for retransmission.On the other hand, trying to do a video chat with your snugums back on Earth will be awful. It will be 4K resolution, at a minimum, but you will have to wait at least half an hour and up to an hour and a half from saying, ""I love you"", until you know whether she/he responds in the way you hope. The same kind of delay will apply if you try to view a Web page on Earth. The result is that it isn't slow, but it will sure feel like it is.So, the connection will be fast and that will be enough for some purposes, but woefully inadequate for others.[I actually described a simple minded send data/wait for acknowledgement/retransmit if request approach. Actually, it work work like that. All data will be send with extra bits to make it likely that it can be reconstructed even if hit by a burst of static. There are then two kinds of data: those that it's okay to lose some of occasionally, like video feeds, and those where no loss is acceptable, like the high resolution image of the first Martian life form. If a chunk of the first type of data is smashed, you just toss it. It is the second type of data where you need an acknowledgement from the receiver saying that the data was successfully received or that it must be resent.

They stepped in when my biological parents couldn’t.However, there are two sides to every story, no?Five years ago, my parents were getting ready to move back to the US from our home country. I planned a visit to see them and other family before the big move. It was on that trip that I met my biological mother. My adoptive parents (mom) had done all the footwork locating her for me. We picked her up at a train station - the instant recognition/bond was…I don’t even know how to explain it. We knew who the other was without even saying a word. Didn’t even need a “hello”.I learned that she was in college when she found out she was five months pregnant with me, a product of a short relationship she was in. She never informed my father. Her father (my grandfather) told her she couldn’t keep me and sent her away to live in another city with my aunt until she was ready to give birth. No one ever knew about me except her family.I always wanted siblings and I was anxious to see if I had any. She ended up marrying a man who had 2 children from a previous relationship. Giving me up had been too painful so she decided to raise his kids rather than have any more of her own. At first I felt special knowing that I was her one and only. Her husband never knew about me (since I was born many years before they met) and she didn’t know how to bring it up with him after all these years. No big deal.

We fully understand how paper flexes and how air molecules flow and interact. The physics is quite well understood.The problem is essentially the same as weather forecasting. We don’t have perfect information about the airflow right now - and the further in time we predict ahead, the more any small error in our information will throw the prediction off-track.The well known “Butterfly Effect” applies here. The moment when you released the sheet of paper from your hand, your heart beat - the small additional flow of blood through your forearm caused a small ripple along your skin as that blood pulsed through your wrist. This started a tiny pressure wave that propagated upwards to the underside of the sheet of paper - giving it a very slight upward curve - which in turn changed the pressure of the air above that point - starting an airflow away from there - which in turn caused a frictional force across the surface of the paper that started a slight rotation…etc…etc…the end result of which is that the paper lands text-side up instead of text-side down.Did we consider the effect of your heartbeat in the initial conditions? Probably not.It’s simply that this problem has vast numbers of degrees of freedom.Now - if you want the answer for a perfectly uniform sheet of material with initial conditions described by abstract equations - and with a sufficiently powerful super-computer - we could undoubtedly produce a convincing simulation of a piece of paper doing it’s thing…but why would this be useful? We still couldn’t do this with any degree of accuracy for a real problem.But why would you even want to?

The ground underneath the pad (or at the bottom) would have to be angled, so that the flames don’t “bounce” back up, and cause additional heat or vibrations to that very rocket. Notice how right away, we introduced a couple new dangers to any healthy rocket plume:* We already had FLAME / FIRE / PLUME (PRESSURE!)And because of it, we must add the following two as main dangers during a rocket launch:* HEAT / TEMPERATURE(To give you an idea, I’ve posted a photo of thermite. The hottest man-made substance, reaches almost 4000 °F (2200 °C), and burns through asphalt and most everything else… The Shuttle’s SRBs burned at the same or a bit hotter temperatures… more on this below)* VIBRATION / SOUNDSo as we said, the first thing we need to do is deflect that mean hot flaming machine at an angle.Enter the Launch Pad TrenchThe pad’s trench was designed not only to be a stable launch platform for rockets (from Apollo to the Shuttle and on), but in being so it contains components that help maintain and improve that stability.The MFD (Main Flame Deflector): This is a ramp-like structure, at two different angles. One to deflect the Orbiter’s three SSME’s (Space Shuttle Main Engines), and the other side for the SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). These angles are based on studies, calculations, and the meat and potatoes of engineering, in order to help with the three dangers we’ve identified above.Here is an Apollo Era MFD:As mentioned above, the MFD photos shown from this point on will be for the Space Shuttle program, which will show one side of the Flame Face differently shaped/angled than the other.Watch NASA work super-fast at building the Shuttle-era MFD:How does the Trench and MFD look together as a whole in the pad?These are made of multi-layered reflective concrete, thermal tiles, and other materials. Of main concern is not just damage to the Trench for re-usability, but also the potential for FOD (Foreign Object Debris) or “chunks of stuff” flying out and potentially damaging the vehicle at its most critical stage.Now while that solution may help deflect the super-hot flame to the side, it sure does nothing to mitigate the pressure and sound/vibrations during the approximate four seconds that the Shuttle Assembly (commonly known as the stack) will spend in its influence.The study:After NASA failed to convince a lot of people and a few chimpanzees to stand under there with a thermometer during a shuttle launch, modifications to the MFD were made in order to be able to measure this amount of force affecting various areas of the MFD and trench.(this is probably a good time to notice the orbiter’s SSME flame face on the right, vs the much steeper angle of the SRB’s on the left). Shown also are the sensors that detected the amount of force during launch.The results were something like this.Heat rate after one second of launch (SRB’s):In terms of pressure, this is what was recorded after launch:What is 3660 psi (25.2 MPa) in terms of pressure? About 250 bars, or atmospheres. About 7 full-size elephants standing on an area the size of the palm of your hand. Except it would be 7 elephants for each time the palm of a hand fits in that center area pictured above.So 4000–5000 °F (2200–2800 °C) temperatures, 250 bars of pressure… what about vibrations?Another study tells us “Intense acoustic noise and vibration are unavoidable and undesirable by-products generated by the launching of a spacecraft, such as Space Shuttles. The generated noise during firing of rocket engines manifests itself to launch vehicle, sensitive spacecraft and launch pad in the form of airborne acoustics and structure-borne vibration. Therefore, a successful space mission requires thorough consideration of complex sound and vibration interaction of vibro-acoustics effects. The noise and vibration caused by spacecraft rocket engines on launch pads is extremely intense (approximately 180–190 dB) and produces vibration not only of the spacecraft vehicle but also of the launch tower and related support facilities. These vibration levels can be of sufficient magnitude to cause fatigue and eventual failure of some parts. The noise at launch (also during the two-minute liftoff and trans-sonic climb phase through the atmosphere from rocket exhaust and the turbulent boundary layer excitation, separated flows, wake flows and shocks) causes an hostile noise and vibration environment not only for the spacecraft itself but also for the delicate electronics and payload packages aboard. Then, the primary source of structural vibrations and internal loads during launch is due to these acoustic loads.” (Credit Revista chilena de ingeniería).Above we can see the typical vibration time history during a Space Shuttle launch.Above is a diagram describing the main noise and vibration response of pad structures induced by rocket launch.So to help mitigate some of these vibrations, the following is then introduced:The Water Sound Suppression System:Goes something like this (test, without the launch platform).Bubbles have the ability to absorb a remarkable amount of sound. As sound waves propagate through the water and encounter an air bubble, it causes the bubble to compress. The compression converts the sound energy into heat, substantially dampening the noise.NASA makes use of the effect by spraying water molecules into the surrounding air at the Mobile Launcher Platform. Similar to the compression of the bubbles, when water molecules encounter a sound wave, they begin to vibrate, converting the sound energy into heat.The water system protects massive rockets during launch. Seconds before launch, 16 nozzles create a cascade of water which absorbs most of the sound energy. The system is effective enough to reduce the noise by half. It reduces acoustical levels within the orbiter payload bay to about 142 decibels, below the design requirement of 145 decibels.At the time of liftoff, the flow rat...",323 followers,Mario Gravina,791,760,1.7M,12.0,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-will-the-Internet-be-on-Mars

After 1971 no country has the gold standard, all are replaced by something else entirely: trust.The reason why dollar, euro, yen or any other currency is valuable is because certain entites make it the legal tender, a way to settle taxes and debts within their borders and because you trust those governments not to do something stupid about it, such as print too many of those notes, to make them just wads of paper.Cryptocurrency is like that, it’s a hash file and not a paper, but otherwise identical to other fiat currencies - but without the backing of a state. The only reason why they’re valuable is because you can find other people who will buy them, in hopes there will be even more people who will buy them to drive the price up. This is the dynamics of a pyramid scheme.It is possible to get rich in one, just don’t count on it.","29,750 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,882,7.6K,248.6M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency

This will be a significant step in changing the financial system. The Chinese authorities are actively introducing many modern technologies into the everyday life of their citizens, so it can be expected that at least within the country, crypto-yuan will quickly spread in accordance with the party’s plans.For other countries, 2020 should be the year of the release of their own digital currencies. Most likely, they will appear after crypto yuan.The appearance of CBDC on the state agenda was mainly due to the recognition of the potential of cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins. Organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have repeatedly said that central banks should start developing their own cryptocurrencies.In the future, we can expect a single global digital currency. In October 2019, the Bank for International Settlements held the first G20 Central Banks summit to discuss the idea of ​​a global cryptocurrency. In Switzerland, the Bank for International Settlements, together with the Central Bank of the country, has already created a center for the development of a single settlement token among the world Central Banks.All of the above facts tell us that the transition of states to digital currencies is one of the elements of the next stage in the development of mankind.

Below, we take a simplified look at how cryptocurrencies like bitcoin work. Let's start with the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. A cryptocurrency is really no more than a digital or virtual token that represents a particular asset or utility. Cryptocurrencies are built on a blockchain, which is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records all transactions that take place on the network.Essentially, a blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is constantly growing as ""completed"" blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.",0 followers,Steph Brooks,893,0,0,4.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market – which had been crashing since January – started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since – between $2 and $2.8.The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.What is happening to EOS these days?Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part — EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.Wallet Investor also expects the currency’s price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025.",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,1.1K,54,909.5K,5.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency

You can scale up pretty easily if you aren't able to afford much to start with.Mining a variety of coins allows you to have backup income streams rather than relying on one coin's value.

All I do is log in, even on mobile, and check on my coins etc. Crypto won't go away and established cloud mining services add new, reliable coins to their selection often so you can pick what you mine for best results.I consider myself wealthy now but I didn't start out that way as a solo miner, mining Bitcoin in my room in a rental shared apartment!

19,"You’ve probably heard of cryptocurrency (orYou’ve probably heard of cryptocurrency (orYou might have done some research but thought it looked too technical or complicated. We’re here to tell you that it’s not!Read on as we walk you through it and cover several great ways of earning an income with cryptocurrency.– 1 –Buy and holdBuying and holding is the method you’re probably most familiar with when it comes to investing and making money with cryptocurrency: You purchase some sort of asset (like stocks), you let interest build up, and then you eventually cash out.It’s the same idea in buying and holding with crypto, except you are waiting for the price of your chosen currency to go up so you can sell at a rate higher than when you bought. This is one of the best and easiest ways to focus on how to make money in cryptocurrency.For example Bitcoin was worth around $13 in 2013, and at the most peak price we’ve seen so far was nearly $20,000 in 2018.If you’d like to know how to make money with cryptocurrency by using buying and holding, we have some articles ready for you so you can get your coins and get started!How to buy bitcoinHow to buy liteconHow to buy ethereumHow to buy rippleWhile there are MANY different coins out there, we recommend you stick to the 4 mentioned above. These are the safest and have been around for a while. If you invest in a new coin it might be cheap to buy lots of them, but there’s a very high chance the coin could just disappear. Coins that have been around a while don’t have that same risk.If you’re ready to buy, we recommend that you visit Coinbase, which has been ranked as the most “beginner friendly” exchange.– 2 –Buy and hold for dividendsThe strategy and currencies above will pay you when you eventually sell at a higher price than when you bought. However, some currencies will actually pay you just for holding them, which makes this a very lucrative method of making money You don’t actually purchase or own the cryptocurrency…you simply hold it and keep it in circulation. Some examples of these coins are:– 3 –Staking cryptocurrenciesThis strategy combines the first two we mentioned: you buy a currency, hold it, plan to sell it for a profit at a later time, AND you also receive dividends from just holding it. This is a great secret in making money with cryptocurrency.Some examples of these currencies are:– 4 –MiningWhen considering how to make money with cryptocurrency, mining is one of the methods that always comes up. Mining cryptocurrency is one of the best ways to make money with altcoins as it’s extremely passive:But there’s the only possible issue…investing in the equipment. While you can mine cryptocurrency without extremely high end hardware, the better the hardware, the faster it can create more coins for you and the better your chance of actually making money. Mining works by having computers solve complex mathematical problems, and when they solve them, you are rewarded with cryptocurrency.The thing is that as more cryptocurrency is created, the problems get harder and harder, and so if you don’t have a high end system, it can take a LONG time to solve things. You might also need cooling units, extra electricity upgrades, and more to support all this.Also MANY different people are trying to solve the same problem at the same time. If your computer is too slow and someone else solves the problems first, you get nothing, so investing in a high end system is almost always needed.– 5 –Day tradingThis method is a bit more advanced and involves looking for patterns in financial trading charts every day. Because cryptocurrency is very volatile in that the price can change drastically over a day, someone who constantly tracks the price over a day can make a very large return on investment by buying some coins in one hour, and selling them an hour later.We wouldn’t recommend this if you’re a beginner, or if you don’t want to follow charts every single day. If this sounds like you, it would be better to consider the other options. But if you have experience in trading or previous knowledge in crypto, this could be– 6 –MicrotasksIf you’re wondering how to make money in cryptocurrency, you should consider microtasks. These are small services you do for someone and you receive payment in cryptocurrency. You might fill out an online survey, test an app, debug a website, or something similar.Cointasker estimates that a single microtask will, on average, pay out 0.00001426BTC, or around $0.90 (as of July 2018), for around 10 minutes of work.Some websites where you can find lists of microtasks that pay out in cryptocurrency are:You can also apply for freelancing jobs on sites like Upwork, and ask to be paid in cryptocurrency. Be sure if you do this that you respect the terms of service and rules of the site though.– 7 –Work for cryptocurrencyAs we mentioned in the microtasks section, many employers are happy to pay for work in cryptocurrency. If youBlogs that are specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency are also happy to pay writers who want to work in crypto as well.Here are some sites you can browse:– 8 –Currency and exchange arbitrageCryptocurrency exchanges are simply online platforms that allow you to make accounts, and login to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. But, the price of a currency in one exchange might be different to that in another, and the prices of all the currencies are also always changing.By tracking these numbers you can make a profit: You might buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. You could also buy one cryptocurrency and then invest into another that has a lower dollar per coin value. This way you’d own more coins overall with the hope of the higher number of coins making you a profit compared to if you had stayed with the other coins, and owned less of them.– 9 –FaucetsYou should know that there are various apps and websites that offer bitcoins as a reward for completing a designated task. These websites or apps are known as bitcoin faucets and there are thousands of them online. The only catch is that the amount of bitcoins they give is very small, and it varies from 100 Satoshis (0.000001 BTC) to 10,000 Satoshis (0.0001 BTC).The tasks you usually complete range from things like clicking on ads, watching videos, and filling out surveys. Here are a list of bitcoin faucets you can look at.– 10 –Affiliate marketingIf you own a website or business, this might be a good way of making some extra money. In simple terms, affiliate marketing is where you’re paid a commission when someone from your website clicks a link of another company, and purchases one of their products. If the company offers payouts in coins, you can choose this instead of getting paid in cash.– 11 –Trading botsFor strategies like day trading, you need to be looking at charts and your computer constantly, manually buying and selling when you think the time is right. This involves a lot of work using your own brain to come up with predictions based on the data…not to mention staring at complex financial charts for hours on end. When you’re still figuring out how to make money with cryptocurrency, this can definitely be exhausting and tedious.As with most things in the world today, this process has been automated in a great way: computers can perform thousands of calculations much faster than you or I, and use algorithms as well as data science to predict crypto pricing strategies.By investing in a crypto trading bot, you can have something automatically buying and selling at the right time based on thousands of data points instead of having to manually guess or look at a screen 24 hours a day. The bot will do the trading for you.","358,061 followers",Sean Kernan,5.5K,5.6K,722.9M,19.0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency

Wipes out other other physical condition humans without a sweat. Sure he’s 1500 years old, so I guess he wasn’t the best example, but I couldn’t think of anyone else.Never mind, here’s a great example. I don’t recall this guy taking combat classes in his first movie before the super serum.

Bonus: she doesn’t even know that she’s beautiful or doesn’t put much effort in her appearance yet you can tell by her perfectly manicured hands or carefully tousled hairstyle that says otherwise. According to movies, she’s not “beautiful” or anyone’s top list simply because she keeps to herself.Take off your glasses and style your hair, and suddenly you’re the most attractive person ever clicheFrom dorky sweet and introverted journalistTo super hunk with massive muscles.From unpopular dorky girl with glassesTo beloved royal beauty with no glasses.Female assassin who was orphaned at a younger age, grew up on the streets, tormented or scorned.All of these women had bad handouts in life so they had to toughen up. Yet every “hardened” female killer you see in movies, tv shows or video games have the same sad backgrounds in different phrases as if you have to have a shitty life to become a trained killer. Movies don’t stray from this. Some people don’t have shitty lives yet still killed people in their lives just because they can.Tiny slender woman beat down a whole group of buff dudes effortlessly while looking like a model doing so.Let’s be honest, men can easily overpower women. Yet you see 110–120 pound actresses beat down 10+ guys who are physically fit without messing up their hair or hardly getting scratches. When I was sparring with guys, they were holding back to avoid severely injuring me because one full power punch or kick would end me.The useless military and police clicheAlmost every movie that show the military or police force make them look like total idiots with high tech and guns. While in real life (there are some idiots in the police and military ranks) when it comes to dangerous situations they generally aren’t panicking or clueless. Similar to my useless guards, they are shown to be overpowered easily. Also, they’re shown to be unnecessarily aggressive or clueless as if they can’t think for themselves or why should they listen to the protagonist as they’re in a bloody war zone.For example, when Captain America was ordering the police to protect civilians at a certain location, the leader automatically retorted why should he listen to him. Um hello? Aliens are invading and terrorizing civilians, civilians you should be protecting instead of just pandering around. Only after Cap beats up a bunch of aliens in front of him is when he finally orders his men to do what Cap ordered him to do so.Either movies vastly underestimate how powerful and effective military weapons and air strikes are or they purposefully depower them when it comes to the military combating aliens or zombies, rendering their weapons almost useless.While we don’t know how advanced aliens would be in real life, it shouldn’t be that easy to wipe out the whole military force on Earth. Who knows, maybe it is.If there’s one thing all governments don’t fail to do unanimously, they spend a lot of money, time and effort into weapons of mass destruction. With the modern age evolving, it’s only natural for weapons to evolve as well and the more technology advances, so will our weapons. Those same weapons should have no problems wiping out walking flesh bags (zombies) and the world shouldn’t become an zombie apocalypse due to the military constantly evolving and scanning for threats.The government is pretty good at keeping things contained and hushed. If there was a zombie outbreak from their lab, it was probably most likely neutralized already and we didn’t even know it. Movies portray the military as inadequate to keep things contained and being virtually powerless or too late to stop them despite their arsenal while we know in real life it would be the opposite.",339 followers,Alex Robinson,2K,825,21.4M,7.0,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

Apparently she had phoned in sick and did not expect to return for a few days. She was a lovely lady but we were not particularly close emotionally or professionally. I began my day in the usual way, but couldn’t stop thinking about her and some of the short conversations Tammy (not her real name) and I previously had when we casually met in the kitchen or bathroom or wherever. As I tried to concentrate on my work, things started to feel a little “off”. But why? Everybody is entitled to take some sick time, and it was rare for Tammy not to come in. Thoughts of planning my day vanished as I started to feel a sense of urgency. I phoned her. No answer. At that point I felt an overwhelming desire to pay her a visit. The Personnel Dept had her address and, reluctantly gave it to me, sensing my unusual insistence that I HAD to see her, even without a valid reason.Arriving at her home, it appeared that no one was home. The blinds were pulled shut and it was eerily quiet. There was no answer to my loud and insistent knocking. More alarm bells, but logic told me that she was probably at the doctors office. The sense of impending doom overrode my logic as I raced around the back of her home. I found a sliding door that was locked, but leaving a very small opening. I learned later that it was just wide enough for her large cat to use but not large enough for anyone else to enter. I, however, was small enough to squeeze through with a great amount of effort, so I did. Nobody downstairs. I literally run upstairs with my heart pounding by this stage. There she was. In bed and unconscious. But alive - just. The ambulance I phoned for arrived within minutes.Tammy had tried to commit suicide and had gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure the desired outcome. Another few minutes and she would have succeeded. She was admitted to a facility appropriate to her needs and remained there for several months.I did not keep in touch with Tammy, especially after she made it very clear to me that my interference was not wanted and, at the time, she really did want to die. I somehow “know” that she is now grateful for her life and is doing the remarkable things she was always meant to do. I believe we all have a purpose in this life and that her experience, although probably negative at the time, has allowed her to become a blessing to others and a positive motivation for people who find themselves in her situation.For me, I continue to listen to that small inner voice. Is it intuition or coincidence? I believe it is the Universe, God or a higher power that is willing to guide me, and everybody willing to hear, along our path in this life. I’m learning to trust more and more as I walk through this fascinating story we call our life.After thought: I have had a couple of comments that have prompted me to add a post script, below. This is a copied response to a much appreciated reader.“Hi Mors, thank you for your response. I felt it important to let you know that Tammy completely recovered, mentally and physically. I was so grateful to hear from a mutual acquaintance some time later that she did eventually realise that she had two boys and a fiancé who loved her dearly, as she loved them, and did in fact “live happily ever after”. However, I totally respect your views. I too would like to have a choice when or if the time comes and it is appropriate. My mother had a DNR (do not resuscitate) document in place when she died and it was followed. I believe every one of us has free will, but on this occasion Tammy’s decision was “temporary” due to circumstances. Had that not been so, I do not believe the Universe would have sent me on such an urgent mission.”",84 followers,Gaye Bockman,1.3K,76,171.5K,23.0,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

I could never put my finger on why, but being in the same room put my hackles up. I never felt safe around him and felt extremely uncomfortable being in business with him.We made a go of it for a while, but I could never shake the fact this dude constantly put me on edge whenever he was near.It kept getting worse and worse until finally my friend and I were like “something’s wrong. I don’t know what or how, but something’s wrong. We need to get out.”So we packed up our belongings and cleared out of the office one day.A week or two later, Geeky Guy comes into the computer store to discover Ex-Cop has cleaned out the safe, emptied the company bank accounts, cleared out the inventory, and disappeared. No sign of him.Shortly after that, we pick up the newspaper to find Ex-Cop in the news, being arrested with his private plane packed stem to stern with cocaine.",3 followers,The Ash System,2.5K,0,0,25.0,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

She really would have been my ideal caregiver.Daycare 2, the caregiver seemed nice but her childcare area which was on the split level of her house looked bare, red flag 1. The carpet was extremely worn down. She claimed that she doesn't have any kids under her care now since they all started school…all of them? Red flag 2. She also claimed that she had a daycare in another town nearby but decided to close that one, red flag 3. I just had a bad feeling & decided to keep looking. She later called me to see if I was still interested & I told her that her carpet was dirty...lol. She got upset but that's the first thing lame excuse that popped into my head.Daycare 3, the caregiver was friendly, lots of toys & kid friendly furniture in her garden room which was setup for childcare. References checked out. She was a widow who raised 5 kids on her own, her older daughter sometimes helped her. She was my babysitter until my daughter went to school & I still occasionally talk to her. She would confide in me all her family problems & I helped her with minor things usually technology related or getting references for handyman etc.Well about my instinct, I was talking to my babysitter about daycare 2 & she happened to know that lady as they were from the same ethnicity, same religion, same business & lived 2 streets away. My babysitter said that daycare 2 used to operate in another town just as that lady indicated & had to close it due to 2 children being injured/died in her care. Daycare2 did not disclose that pertinent information during my interview. Allegedly one baby died from SIDS during nap time & the “caregiver “ didn't check on the baby for hours. The 2nd incident was when a little boy fell down from a short wall during outdoor play & later died in the hospital from his injuries. I don't know how she can still operate a daycare but I'm glad I didn't go with daycare 2.

Investors can organize their investing plans according to their targets and aspirations.Here are some good investment strategies that you can follow as a new investor?The holding tenure was determined by the amount of value that investors wanted to add to their portfolios. Investors will invest in companies that they anticipate will grow in the next years, enhancing the underlying value of their shares. Growth investment is another term for this. Investors, on the other hand, can choose short-term holding if they anticipate a company will produce good value in a year or two. Investors' choices influence the holding period. For instance, how swiftly they want money to buy a house, send their children to school, plan for retirement, and so on.Since some companies are undervalued by the stock market, value investing involves investing in them based on their inherent value. The concept behind investing in such companies is that when the market goes through a correction, the value of such undervalued companies will be adjusted, and the price would surge, leaving investors with large returns when they sell.Note:-Warren Buffet, a well-known investor, implements this method.","135,195 followers",Hector Quintanilla,10.6K,1.2K,88.2M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-investment-strategies-that-are-unconventional

But, believe me, all of this is unavoidable, since the benefits of contemporary technology are evident. Others are anticipated to follow the banking industry, which was the first to embrace cryptocurrencies. One of the next areas of our lives will change the rules of the game. Now, a new game trend known as Game-Fi, or play to earn, is gaining traction.This is undoubtedly a favorable aspect that can enhance gaming as an area of amusement and revenue. What effect will this have on games? It's simple: gamers will now be able to play for money, allowing them to monetize their time. In the context of human life, this may imply giving up a job and spending more time playing games where players may have pleasure.Of course, I didn't understand all that. I was lucky enough to find out about the RedAttack project, whose beta is about to start.

There is no doubt CC will be the future. No, not today but someday when people will realise that really its their money not that of those banks or government that it should be in control of them.

Like this:Woman in my life:Me:Woman:Me:Woman:Me:Woman: [Visible anger.]My inner monologue:Finally, after one such unnecessary conflict with my wife, she told me a secret: being agreeable all of the time is not a good thing. Not having opinions about most things doesn’t mean that you’re easy to get along with; it means that you don’t care. At least, that’s how women interpret it.So, I started forming opinions about things when women asked for my opinion, and it’s worked wonders. Even if, deep down, I’d be happy with any decision, I still state a preference for one decision, and defend it if necessary.This has helped me out a lot at home and at work. Just last month, there was a schedule change and my three coworkers (all women) and I had to decide on the order in which we’d take our breaks, since only one of us can go on break at any given time. The truth was that I would have been happy with any break time because, honestly, it’s not like we’re doing manual labor and need to rest our bodies. I do half of my teaching while sitting down anyway, writing on an iPad which is then projected onto a screen for my students to see. I never leave work exhausted. Anyway, my coworkers were putting a lot of thought into their requested break times, so I figured I should, too. I picked a time, and, even though it was a time that another one wanted (I didn’t know that when I picked it), they all seemed to appreciate the fact that I had an opinion, and then built the rest of the break schedule around what I wanted.Experience has taught me that if I’d just taken whatever was left after my coworkers picked what they wanted, the women would have left the meeting angry at me for being so agreeable.It’s like there’s a base level of friction women are comfortable with, and that level is above the “zero level” where a lot of men, like me, dwell.I think this is why the only people I know who actually enjoy reality television are women.

Immediately I recognized it as the spinny-thing I had seen in a YouTube video, a fidget spinner.

Not only was it oddly satisfying to just spin it on my hand or on the table, I found that if it's spinning on your thumb and index finger, and you twist your wrist side to side, you could feel the resistance in your wrist, because of the gyroscopic force of the spin.Anyways, after I realized how fun they were, I kind of forgot about it for a few days.Then I started seeing more.And more.And more.And now it seems that just about everyone has used one, and most people own one. I decided I was going to try and buy some to resell at school, and maybe I would make $50–100.Boy was I wrong.After I found them in wholesale quantities online, I realized just how cheap I could get them. These spinners were going for about $1.80, in quantities of 100 or more, and I needed to buy some.The next day at school I asked around about how much people were willing to pay for some, and heard that prices varied for $5 on amazon to $15 at the local 7-eleven.I decided to place an order for 100 of them. My total came out to just over $180, and I'm currently waiting on them to arrive.On Facebook, I found people willing to pay up to $15 for them, which isI'll update this once I start selling them.***To anyone saying that I am “ripping people off”, please understand the principle of supply and demand. Right now, where I am, these spinners are out of stock everywhere. The demand for them is extremely high, and stock is extremely low.This means I can charge what***UPDATE***THEY CAME IN!Today at around 5pm DHL showed up to my door with my box.here's all of them laid out!I've already sold 4, so hopefully this does turn into a good investment!

As demand surged, so didMining with a CPU has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's examine these in order to understand better if and when it is appropriate to use your CPUs to mine Bitcoin. As you may recall in the beginning, everyone used a CPU to mine for bitcoins. Those days are long gone, but you can still mine on your CPU.Pros of miningCPU mining is very useful in the process of understanding mining. We strongly believe that's where every miner should start. You do not need any specialized hardware other than your computer. In the process of setting up the software, you will learn all the little tricks that are applicable to your hardware. You will also learn how the CPU will compare to more advanced hardware, such as GPUs and ASICs.To summarize, we encourage you to try CPU mining for the following reasons:Cons of miningCPU mining for Bitcoin is unfortunately no longer profitable. That is, it is highly unlikely that one could earn enough funds to cover the cost of electricity used up by the CPU .Best practices when mining with CPUsLet's look into the recommended things to do, when mining with CPUs. Although mining Bitcoin is no longer profitable with a CPU, mining other coins may bring in some profits. If you are going to use your CPU for mining, you might as well observe the practices that are going to make it easier and safer for you.First, make sure that your computer has adequate cooling and the CPU fan is working along with all the other fans in your computer. Make sure your computer has adequate airflow around it. There should not be anything directly around or on top of your computer. Basically, you need good airflow. The reason is that, while mining, your CPU's cores will be running at 100%, which will generate a good amount of heat. If that heat is not dissipated by the fans, it may cause damage to your hardware.Secondly, to get the most hashes out of your CPU, close all other programs running on your computer. If you are mining with a pool, have only the mining software open. If you are mining solo, you will also need to have your wallet open. Be aware that, if you are using your computer for any other purpose...Profitability of miningAs we have mentioned earlier, the Bitcoin network hash rate is really high now. Mining with a CPU is no longer guaranteed to bring in profits. This is due to the fact that, during the mining process, you are competing with other miners to try to solve a block. You will be at a disadvantage if those other miners are running faster hardware, as your hardware can only make a certain amount of guesses (hashes) in a given time frame.To compare the mining speed of a few CPU's, look at the follow the tableCPU don't hash fast.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,850,996,155.3M,20.0,https://www.quora.com/Ive-made-6000-this-year-actively-trading-stocks-but-now-I-have-a-lot-on-my-plate-What-is-the-best-way-to-passively-invest-60-000

Same with sound - might be stereoscopic but typically doesn’t create a full 3d soundstage particularly of stuff behind you.Spatial computing tries to bridge that gap, plain and simple.It wants to (depending on who you talk to) either create a very real “feeling” world around you (while you’re sitting in a chair) or be something you carry with you into the world moving around, which provides enhanced computer overlays of information.In cars, there are two great use cases.If you’re a passenger, you can use it to beat the dreaded “are we there yet” syndrome. You can combine the motion that the body already feels with a storyline and computed visuals (have to sync to actual motion, right?) to turn a three hour ride to see Grandma into a adventure on a creaky old train in an abandoned mine… or an ocean voyage… or riding a Thraxxian dwebniz across the plains of Zynity IV.If you’re a driver, you can use it to develop super informative heads up displays - taking all sorts of stuff into account.

At 13 I found out all of his lies and that's where the trouble between us began. I fought back and didn't believe a word he told me, I resented him so much. He consistently made our arguments physical and I always had bruises from him. In highschool I would visit the counselor often as I didnt have any friends.

Oh, how circumstantially-convenient…Science relies on a rigorous set of standards and scientific method to differentiate fact from fiction. From what is independently-verified from empirical evidence has the potential to be regarded as fact; whereas anecdotal “stories”, personal accounts, speculation, conjecture, or hearsay are not considered as having met any form of professional standards and likely have limited value in society, especially in science. They are nothing but a distraction. No professional discipline or school of thought has any time, nor should they have any patience, for this nonsense, when time, money and resources are much better used to help find a cure for cancer - not serve as a handmaiden to give an attention-seeker a public platform.The job of science is to not to run down every rabbit-hole and chase every conspiracy-theory that some storyteller decides to impose and make scientists run-ragged over. The burden of proof is on the storyteller, not the scientist, and the standards of “proving” anything are high.Frankly, the best way to deal with the latest unmitigated political attack on fact-based science by the so-called “Flat Earth Society” is to not give the group or their propaganda any attention, airtime or debate, because things like this were long-since settled centuries ago. Not everything needs to be placed in a revolving door and rehashed at the whim of others. “Fair and balanced” is not universally-applicable to everything. If a mathematician tells you that 2+2=4, a politician screams that 2+2=6, and then if a well-meaning middle-ground mediator wants everyone to compromise with 2+2=5 - it is STILL WRONG!!!“Truth” is the main point of contention. Something does not get universally-regarded as fact until it meets certain standards - and facts, not politics or agendas, are what is important and are the basis for the modern society that we live in. The basis for extraterrestrials might have many entertaining conspiracy-theories, but even if one or more events were indeed true - the credibility of any extraterrestrial encounter is suspect due to the vast number of people who have fabricated a contrived set of circumstances and even built props intended to fool those who welcome conspiracy theories.

So, why bother?Science does notThe primary point of contention is the lack of verifiable, reproducible evidence. Secondarily, extraterrestrial visits are something to prove and not something whose denial must be proven. Why? Because everything we know (so far) in science speaks against the idea. We have well-verified theories against FTL travel. OTOH, we know that, if you have enough power at your disposal, you can travel across the galaxy in a few days (actually a distance that equals that because traveling at such a high speed makes even colliding with molecules a problem) in your time frame. It will still take around 100,000 years in the galaxy’s time frame.We can infer from a great deal of evidence that technological societies on other planets are very rare indeed, so rare that finding one within 100 light-years of us would be like winning the PowerBall lottery.Likewise, another technological society (and there probably are/have been/will be some elsewhere in this gigantic universe) would have to find us and decide to visit for some reason that I cannot divine. Even fantastic technology must deal with background noise, and that limits the range to a few hundred light-years. Even if extraordinary technology were created, extra-galactic detection would be impossible and would only happen millions of years after our presence developed.It’s fairly certain now that no such society is in our immediate neighborhood (100 light-years radius). But, that’s only one-millionth of the galaxy. Suppose that one is out there 1,000 light-years away. Suppose that they could search the 100 billion or so stars in our galaxy and that they could detect the peculiar evidence of life on a planet orbiting our star (not likely, but suppose anyway). They’d be looking at our planet as it was 1,000 years ago. Absolutely no evidence of technology would show up on their scans.Oh! But, to visit now or in the past would require that they discovered us long ago, long enough ago to travel here, a trip that must take at least 1,000 years even if they could travel at near light speed. The people on their home planet would have to wait another 1,000 years to hear about their discoveries. The cost of such a voyage would be staggering, even for a very advanced civilization. Would our world undertake such a voyage? I doubt it. What value would such a trip have? It’s not as though you can take mineral resources back in under 1,000 years. Besides, those are readily available in any solar system without traveling to another.Please note that 1,000 light-years distant is not really far in a galaxy as large as ours. We’re only looking at 0.01% of our galaxy by looking that far.There’s only one scenario that would bring outworlders here: the destruction of their home system, probably by their sun exploding or expanding or dying. They’d have to build a starship large enough to carry the entire race to somewhere else. If they could do that, then they probably could find a closer system to move too. If they found us, and they traveled here, why would they be doing sneaky visits. Using their advanced technology, they could simply sterilize our planet and take it over. If, for some altruistic reason, they decided to leave us alone, they’d just take off to the next best system. You would have to presume some sort of cloaking system for their monstrous spaceship, or we would readily see it.That scenario is so far out in so many ways that it makes sense to ignore it. What are the chances of an advanced technological society losing their solar system somewhere “nearby” and then selecting our system to move to?

At best, it will take another 200 years to get the atmosphere to the desired level of pressure. And this is assuming funding will not be reduced, which is not a given in our stagnant economy. For plants to grow, and the air to be somewhat breathable, the most optimistic forecast puts this at least a couple of thousand years from now.Given the uncertainties remaining on the project, it’s hard to sell any real estate to investors and the project has to rely mostly onThe last frontier remainsIn the year 2100, we managed to send a small probe, at 2% of light speed, using an innovative fusion reactor. It arrived around New Earth 400 years later and by the year 2508, we started to get detailed coverage of the planet.Key parameters like pressure, temperature, gravity, and the magnetosphere are all confirmed to be ok. This New Earth hosts some basic unicellular life, but the probe found no trace of any multicellular organisms. A perfect place to start a new home!This New Earth seems indeed a much better place for humans than Mars, (or any other spot in our solar system), even if we assume the ongoing Martian terraforming efforts will be successful, (which is still a big if).So now again, it’s the year 2520. How do we proceed to colonize this New Earth?In our stagnant economy, there is only that much we can dedicate to interstellar travel, a project that generates no substantial benefits to politicians on Earth who control the funding. Still, they managed to secure $80 billion financing per year, (2020 equivalent), for this exciting project. Quite an impressive achievement for something which is seen by a large part of the world population asFaster than light travel is obviously out of the question. Worse, our space transportation technology isIn the last 500 years, AI has made tremendous progress. Well, to be honest most progress came in the first 100 years. After 2120, we started to face diminishing returns. Even if our AI are today capable of super impressive feats, we never quite reached the holy grail of Artificial General Intelligence. In particular, we realized that consciousness required a biological human body.Our robots would always remain sophisticated machines although they would have no purpose of their own. In a way, it’s a relief. Who wants its washing machine to be self-aware? For the same reasons,Medicine has also achieved impressive progress within the last centuries.

More people provide more expertise. Although, at the same time, the limited volume of the pressurized habitat is a key constraint. Eventually, it was decided that 3 people would be optimal.A simple calculation showed that with a couple of babies born after 20 years, and then every 50 years afterwards, the whole crew would always remain under 9 people, (assuming that people would be living, on average, up to 100 years). This ensures, at all times, a reasonable amount of living space for each crew member.The whole success of the mission relies on maintaining aTo maximize the odds, it has been decided to send, at the same time, two twin ships, following the same course. Beyond obvious mission redundancy, this has another advantage. It provides each crew with continuous real time communications with someone within close range of the ship.On top of the psychological comfort, to know that others are facing a similar fate, this could prove useful to deal with any troubleshooting, as opposed to mission support from Earth, which due to very long transmission delays, would quickly prove to be useless in the case of any emergencies.Dealing with the arrival on this New Earth is a whole new challenge on its own.

Rescue missions sent from Earth would of course not be an option.After such a huge effort, this would be quite sad. So no need to rush.

Within the next 6 decades, the real issue facing scientists and engineers will not be how to make more intelligent software systems. It will be: how to stop criminals employing intelligent machines for their crimes!Computer chip hardware technology will come to a halt within 10 years from now, due to straining the miniaturization limits but it will not halt the development of faster computers. We will see more and more processors on the same board. Within a century, the need to develop faster computers will vanish, due to the inability of the human brain to comprehend the shockingly high amount of data those systems will be spitting out. There would still be competitions to build faster computers, but they will be for academic and curiosity purposes only.When a single computer system will automatically manage your financial accounts, build new video games for you with specifications provided by you, have the detailed map of the entire Earth on it and accomplish complex office tasks with little interference from humans, why would there be a need for a faster computer anyway? A common household computer will have sufficient computing power to plan a complete tour to and from Mars and Earth. NASA and EuSI will have “supercomputers” only for mapping the dark matter and running extremely detailed simulations of singularities.The technological boom produced by broadly intelligent software systems and incredibly fast hardware is difficult to imagine. One of the key improvements will be in propulsion methods. It will become very (relatively) cheap to create antimatter and safely store it, too. The implications will be incredible!Image 2. With affordable antimatter fuel, the real challenge concerning space travel would shift from achieving high velocity to safe travel.With speeds up to 10% the speed of light enabled by antimatter propulsion systems, the real challenge would become how to safely navigate a spaceship. The speed will be simply far exceeding human comprehension and the spaceships’ routes will be planned entirely by intelligent navigation systems, meticulously mapping the paths of individual asteroids and comets. However, even in the case of the slightest error, the ensuing disaster would be incomprehensible. A collision with a mere 0.1 cubic meter space rock/ice will not only completely obliterate the colliding part of the spaceship, but will also generate enough thermal energy to melt the entire section of the spaceship!For travel within a planetary system, speeds no more exceeding 1% the speed of light will be considered safe. It will only be for interstellar travel that the true potential of antimatter propulsion will be unleashed.The availability of cheap, incomprehensibly high energy fuel and incredibly intelligent software systems (and fast hardware to run on) will result in the construction of confoundingly large space telescopes. Within 2 centuries, there will be space telescopes as large as entire countries, orbiting the sun beyond Jovian orbit. They will employ an array of 60 square meters wide mirrors (of course) instead of lens or one colossal mirror (which would obviously fail due to gravity). The data transmitted by these gigantic telescopes would be comprehensible only by intelligent software since it would be sending hundreds of petabytes of dataImage 3.

To solve these problems we either need to:The most basic problem we should have solved within 500 years will be energy storage and creation. Batteries are a huge problem even now, once they are able to equal or exceed chemicals in energy density we will see an enormous change in the world. Energy creation is actually in my opinion only going to be an issue for deep space interstellar voyages beyond the range of a star's light to sufficiently be collected with solar panels. That said I believe that we will have finally solved the issues associated with fusion reactors and have them available for use on our spacecraft.Inertia is the biggest problem in space exploration that I don’t see a lot of discussion around. The importance of this can be seen with how long it will take to accurate from rest to half-light speed(0.5c) would take 5,376 hours at an acceleration of 9.8m/s2. And it will take the same amount of time for deceleration from that speed. While people can survive at higher accelerations it’s going to be uncomfortable real fast, even for the most fit pilots you can think of. But just having an engine with the endurance needed for the above-mentioned performance will make things feasible if not fast.Moving onto the holy grail of space exploration is Faster Thank Light(FTL) travel. This is a staple of science-fiction because of the vast distances involved. It takes light over 4 years to reach the nearest stars from our sun. Alpha Centauri is 40 trillion km from earth and at 0.5c would take 9 years without the accel and decel portions needed. Accounting for those portions of the trip it would take almost 12 years to get from the earth to the nearest start.Hibernation is where biological functions are slowed or halted in a living organism that can then be returned to normal at a later time. This would be useful for any trip outside of the solar system assuming that FTL technology is not available.Increased lifespans would be another way to offset the time it would take to travel between stars. This would make it possible to have trained personnel available for much longer periods reducing the need in some ways of needing to preserve and pass on institutional learning and experience.My assumption is that we will not find a way to implement FTL so our expansion and exploration will be somewhat confined. Even expanding at 0.5c we can reach the other side of the galaxy in 100,000 years, not great but not bad either. Another assumption is that we will be able to store and create near unlimited energy within 500 years, we will be well on our way to exploring the galaxy. With hibernation and life extension, it will also be possible that someone born at the end of this century could see these things take place.To answer your question I think we will have machine probes as far as 300 lightyears (LY) away and manned missions as far as 50 LY within 500 years.

This answer is based on an investigation done by Sahara Reporters in New York.Philip Emeagwali stirs up diverse emotions in Nigerians, Africans, and black people around the world. His claim of being a father of the Internet, of having invented the Connection Machine, of possessing 41patented inventions, of winning “the Nobel Prize of Computing” and of being a “doctor” and/or professor” have been conclusively debunked with widely documented evidence.Yet, the figure of Emeagwali as a black scientific, engineering, and information technology genius and pioneer continues to loom large over discussions of black achievement. The legend of Philip Emeagwali’s purported inventions, widely proven to emanate from the perverse deceptive genius of the man himself, endures and proliferates among Nigerian and black groups around the world.Only recently, the USAfricadialogue googlegroups listserv managed by Professor Toyin Falola of the University of Texas hosted a discussion on Philip Emeagwali’s vast fraud. Participants in the discussion included Nigerian and African intellectuals, scientists, engineers, and IT professionals. Overall, the discussion reinforced and reiterated one of the worst kept secrets in the Nigerian Diaspora, especially in its online community: that none of Emeagwali’s highfalutin claims, on whose strength he has curried and continues to curry favor and recognition from gullible and hero-hungry black people, is true. Yet, just a few days ago, one of Nigeria’s more visible dailies,Nigerians and black people deserve to know who the real Philip Emeagwali is. This will save them from the embarrassment of continuing to celebrate a fraud while real black scientific achievers and pioneers starve for attention and recognition. To correct Nigeria’s scientific and technological lag there is a need for investments — both financial and motivational — in the sciences, engineering, and IT fields. Nigerian youths need inspiration in the quantitative and scientific disciplines, but they should get it from actual, not pretending, black scientific, computing, and engineering heroes, not from phonies like Mr. Emeagwali.Patented Inventions Or The Invention Of Patents?Debunking the many myths of Mr. Emeagwali’s “achievements” is one the easiest things to do on earth if you have a computer with Internet access. Let us start with his claim of possessing 41 (32 by some accounts on some hero-worshipping black websites) patents for various inventions. A simple search at the website of the US Patent and Trade Mark Office (here:Specifically, Mr. Emeagwali claims to have invented the Connection Machine (CM-2). This false claim is displayed boldly and shamelessly onInternet Pioneer?Mr. Emeagwali claims to have used the CM-2 Machine to carry out billions of calculations by connecting over 65,000 processors (computers) around the world. He claims that this was the rudimentary foundation of the Internet. It is on this ground that he has aggrandized to himself the title of “father of the internet.” But this is a barefaced lie at worst and an egregious exaggeration at best. And it is so absurd in its circular logic that it is hilarious. First, as stated earlier, Emeagwali did not invent the Connection Machine on which his “experiment” relied. Second, Emeagwali used more than 65,000 independent processors ""around the world"" (meaning on the Internet) to do his calculation. This means that the Internet already existed and that he RELIED ON it for his calculations. Unless the Internet he claims to have fathered is different from the Internet that already existed at the time of his experiment (and which we all know as the existing internet today), he COULD NOT have invented the Internet or fathered it. He could not have been using an internet that, by his claim, did not exist until he invented it. As this websitePhilip Emeagwali did work in supercomputing in the [late] eighties……. But supercomputing and the Internet are very different areas. And Emeagwali did not contribute to even one of the hundreds of Internet standards, or RFCs (Requests For Comments), that were created in the early decades of the Internet—an open process that anyone could participate in. His supercomputing research was completely unrelated to the Internet.Emeagwali’s research was thus irrelevant to the evolution of the internet. Emeagwali did his supercomputing experiment in the late 1980s. By then, the “core standards” and protocols for information and data flow on the Internet already existed. And although, improvements have been made to the template since then, Emeagwali did not make any of those improvements and cannot therefore claim credit for them.Emeagwali's tenuous—and fraudulent—claim to internet fatherhood rests on his assertion that ""the Supercomputer is the father of the Internet,” “because both are networks of computers working together.” This, experts agree, is not true, as supercomputing is just one component of the Internet and in fact RELIES ON the rudiments of what we know as the internet to work. So, if anything, the internet concept is the father of supercomputing, not vice versa. But even if we accept Emeagwali’s wrong logic, the fact that he did not invent or pioneer supercomputing means that even on this flawed premise and logic he cannot be considered a father of the internet.Authentic histories of the internet are accessible all over the web. One can be found here:The only “history of the internet” source to even recognize Emeagwali as a legitimate computer scientist to be mentioned when chronicling the history of the internet is the book History of the Internet: A Chronology, 1843 to the Present by Christos J. P. Moschovitis, Hilary Poole, Tami Schuyler, Theresa M. Senft. The book was published in 2001. Although Mr. Emeagwali proudly displays the book’s reference to him on his website and claims that the “father of the internet” moniker (which has since been lazily picked up by several media platforms) originated in the book, there is absolutely no such reference in the book. The book’s reference to Emeagwali only states how Emeagwali’s research “effectively stimulate[d] petroleum reserves” by “harnessing the power of parallel computing.” And it is clear from a cursory analysis of the linguistic properties of this specific reference to Emeagwali that Emeagwali himself supplied the material and the claims articulated in it. It is also clear from the reference that it has nothing to do with the internet but is about improving the modeling of oilfields or oil reservoirs. The content and prose are eerily identical to the autobiographical write-ups and claims onThe Nobel Prize Of Computing?Emeagwali’s other claim is that of winning the “Nobel Prize of Computing.” He is, of course, referring to the Gordon Bell Prize, which he won in 1989. Many uninformed observers have since picked up this fraudulent reference, which emanated from• The cash award for the prize is a mere $1000. Often, the amount of an award is a good guide to its prestige and significance in the field.For all these reasons, it is the height of self-promotion and delusional exaggeration for Mr. Emeagwali to claim that he won the Nobel Prize of Computing or that the Gordon Bell is regarded as the Nobel of Computing. Nobody except Mr. Emeagwali regards the prize as such.It is noteworthy that both Emeagwali and the Mobile/TMC Team relied on the CM-2 Machine (the Connection Machine) for their calculations, the same machine that Emeagwali falsely claims to have invented!A final point to note here is that the research for which he won the Gordon Bell Prize (by default) has application and relevance only in the narrow area of oil flow reservoir modeling and oil prospecting. His entry for the competition utilized and optimized the capacity of parallel computing, that is, relied on an already existing Internet. Emeagwali’s own website states that he “accessed the supercomputers over the Internet from local workstations.” Neither the research nor the prize had anything to do with the Internet. The Internet was already invented and fairly perfected by then; otherwise he would not be, in his own words, “accessing the supercomputers over the Internet.” This clarification is necessary and important because some of Emeagwali’s supporters and victims tend to assume wrongly that his purported fatherhood of the internet derives from the research for which he won the Gordon Bell Prize. All these facts can be easily accessed here:“Dr.” Emeagwali Or Doctored Emeagwali?Emeagwali’s final fraudulent claim is that of being a “doctor” and “professor.” Several years ago, before eagle-eyed Nigerians and Africans decided to scrutinize his eye-popping claims, his website audaciously referred to him as “doctor” and “Professor.” Because of recent exposures of his scam, he no longer refers to himself on his website as “Dr. Emeagwali” or “Professor Emeagwali.” However, in what is typical of the Emeagwali scam, his website is still littered with many media references to “Dr Emeagwali” and “Professor Emeagwali.” These stealthily promoted references then get picked up by unsuspecting black media people who are eager to promote black achievement and excellence. Sometimes, he approaches black websites and organizations, asking them to link to or publish his false claims. In the course of the discussion on the USAfricadialogue forum, Ms. Funmi Okelola , the owner and webmaster ofBut many proprietors of black websites and publications have not been as alert to Emeagwali’s antics as Ms. Okelola and have been falling for his scam. In their eagerness to embrace what they believe to be the proud achievements of a “brother,” they have inadvertently donated space and platform to Emeagwali to consolidate and spread his false claims. Because of the virility of the internet, even some non-black websites have picked up these ubiquitous references that are patently false. Here, on this websiteHe will not correct what is clearly a false reference, preferring to take cover in the deniability of being able to say that it is others, not him, who use these false, unearned titles to refer to him. The reason he will not correct this falsehood is that it emanated from him in the first place; most of the references were picked up from his website in the days before scrutiny spooked him into avoiding such direct self-referencing. The clearest evidence yet of his complicity and culpability in this misrepresentation is that he sits through interviews where the clueless, awed interviewers refer to him as “Doctor Emeagwali” and “Professor Emeagwali” and he does not correct them. There is a particularly revolting video on youtube <The false references to him as “doctor” and “professor” are not the only falsehoods that Emeagwali coyly and deftly promotes; he routinely lets interlocutors repeat the many false claims that are based on his own prolific misrepresentations. On this websiteHere is Mr. Emeagwali’s response to her question: “Inventors are reluctant to provide expanded details of their inventions until they receive full patent protection. The reason is that the Patent and Trademark Office can deny patents to inventors that publicly provide details of their invention.” But the truth is that he has neither registered patents for his non-existent inventions nor a patent-pending status. He has no inventions or technologies to patent! The response itself contains a lie. Contrary to Emeagwali’s insinuation that inventors cannot publicly discuss their work until they are patented or that doing so would jeopardize their patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), inventions and products with “Patent Pending” status are routinely discussed, advertized, and marketed on American television. In fact these public discussions of unpatented inventions always carry the disclaimer that patents are pending, meaning that applications have been made. If public discussion of inventions and technologies were detrimental to patent applications, none of these unpatented and “patent pending” technologies and inventions would be on the American market or be advertized on television. This was Emeagwali seeking to perpetuate the myth that he has several technological inventions that are patented or awaiting patents but avoiding having to mention or discussion the specific fictitious inventions for which he claims to have patents in order to have deniability when checks are made at the USPTO and he is confronted with the truth of his falsehood.Racism Or Laziness?The case of Philip Emeagwali is a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of self-delusion, laziness, and a sense of entitlement. Mr. Emeagwali enrolled in a doctoral program in Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1987. His coursework over, he took the comprehensive examination that qualifies one for candidacy. He failed the exam twice and did not take it a third time. In the meantime, he conducted the research that would later win him the Gordon Bell Prize, a research he began as a class project for one of his graduate courses. In 1991, two years after winning the Gordon Bell by default, he petitioned the Dean of the School of Engineering to be allowed to submit a dissertation (despite not having passed his candidacy exam and therefore not being a doctoral candidate) in a different department — the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. His request was curiously granted in what was clearly a sidestepping of standard procedure. Emeagwali submitted the dissertation, basically a rework of his entry for the Gordon Bell competition, on July 24, 1992. A team of internal and external evaluators examined it and found it unworthy of a doctorate and turned it down.Emeagwali then sued the University of Michigan for racial discrimination. The lawsuit was dismissed for lacking merit and also failed on appeal in 1999. The details of Emeagwali’s graduate school records and of the dueling contentions in the lawsuit are all documented hereA dispassionate analysis of the details, affidavits, and arguments submitted in the lawsuit and in the appeals process reveals the following:• Emeagwali was a fairly brilliant student but he was lazy and would not put in the work necessary to earn his degree.• He had a sense of entitlement, feeling that since he was black and had made it into the University of Michigan, he was entitled to a special treatment and academic favors.• This sense of entitlement escalated after he won the Gordon Bell Prize. He thought that he was entitled to a PhD on the strength of the Gordon Bell competition entry when in fact he was not even a doctoral candidate, having failed his comprehensive examination twice.• Emeagwali was more concerned with parlaying his newfound default Gordon Bell fame into profitable self-promotion than with the serious academic effort required to complete the PhD.• He petitioned to be allowed to submit a dissertation only after he realized that he would not be taken seriously as a researcher and may not be able to find a secure job in research or teaching if he did not possess a PhD.This is a story of how a promising, modestly brilliant graduate student was destroyed by his own hubris, entitlement mentality, and laziness. What Emeagwali failed to earn through hard work and diligence, he has since appropriated to himself by calling himself and getting others to call him “doctor” and “professor.”Emeagwali is not a doctor of whatever kind. He is not a professor. He has not held any research or teaching job in any educational or research institution since he failed to get a doctorate degree at Michigan. He has also not done any new research. Emeagwali has no single publication in any scientific journal. A search of the most comprehensive scientific publication database (which can be done online) yields only a reference to his Masters Degree dissertation.Here we have a man who is unemployed, has no serious standing in the scientific, engineering, or computing communities. Yet he is widely referred to as “a father of the internet,” “an internet pioneer,” “the greatest black scientist that ever lived,” “Bill Gates of Africa,” among other over-the-top and unearned titles. The question to pose is: how did the world get so deceived and why did many reputable people and organizations buy into Emeagwali’s con job? Emeagwali is a very industrious, persistent, and successful scam artist; you have to give him that. Very few intellectual frauds have successfully mainstreamed their false claims as Emeagwali has done.Intellectual Fraud And Its Unwitting ValidatorsEven former president Bill Clinton was suckered by the fraud, famously referring to Emeagwali as “one of the great minds of the information age” in his speech to the Nigerian National Assembly in 2000. The Clinton reference has provided cover and alibi for Emeagwali to perfect and spread his false claims. Predictably, Emeagwali’s defenders point to the Clinton reference and to CNN’s and TIME Magazine’s references to him as “a father of the internet” and “the unsung hero” of the internet age respectively. These references are boldly displayed onObviously Clinton was pandering to his Nigerian hosts who believed Emeagwali to be a scientific genius and national hero. Clinton, the savvy politician that he is, and a man who perfected white liberal outreach and pandering to black/African peoples, was relying on the image and descriptions of Emeagwali that was already in the black and mainstream press —descriptions that are traceable to Emeagwali's own misrepresentations on his websites. What Emeagwali does is so clever as to ensnare even a skeptical and vigilant observer, especially one that is already inclined to believe or seek out claims of black scientific achievement for whatever reason. As indicated earlier, Emeagwali plants these autobiographical write-ups that are ridden with falsehoods and misrepresentations in unsuspecting black publications. He does this by aggressively pitching these claims to their editors as he tried to do unsuccessfully with Ms. Okelola. Then, fired by liberal guilt and a desire to seem welcoming to black achievement and excellence, the mainstream media like TIME and CNN, lazily pick up these references and descriptions. Emeagwali then links to, disseminates, and publicizes these mainstream press references and descriptions (which are actually based on his own descriptions of himself and his ""achievements”), thus perfecting and furthering the fraud. This way, he creates deniability for himself. The deception comes full circle but the cycle continues to repeat itself, populating and repopulating the Internet with Emeagwali’s falsehoods.The sophistication and complexity of the fraud notwithstanding, there is no excuse for reputable organizations like CNN and TIME not to have done a simple due diligence on the false claims of Emeagwali. It is true that at the time that TIME and CNN made the glowing references to Emeagwali, the now widely available refutations of his claims were probably not yet available on the internet. Even so, a basic inquiry from the appropriate quarters would have revealed the truth about the claims on which the references to Emeagwali were based. The two reputable organizations failed to carry out this basic fact checking, an elemental reportorial and investigative duty of journalists. Instead, they relied on Emeagwali’s widely disseminated falsehoods for their stories. The case of TIME is particularly scandalous. The story in which it extols Emeagwali is clearly directly based on Emeagwali’s own autobiographical claims onThere is similarly no excuse for President Clinton’s speech writers not to have done basic checks or asked some of the president’s own appointees and advisers who are engineers and scientists about the true value of Emeagwali’s work. Had they done this relatively simply investigation, they would have realized that being a default winner in one category of a minor supercomputing competition for work that has a specific, limited application in the narrow field of oil reservoir modeling does not qualify one to be called “one of the greatest minds of the information age.”A Self-Replicating FraudWhen challenged, Emeagwali and his supporters can say he is merely repeating and linking to what others call him and say about him and that he does not call himself a father of the internet or a doctor or a professor. But the fraud is a self-replicating one, perpetuating and proliferating itself across both the print and virtual media worlds. Other publications that are searching for black scientific achievers do an internet search and then rely on the previous press descriptions of Emeagwali, which ultimately lead back to the man’s fraudulent biographical claims on his own website. The lazy journalists and Pan-African activists lift these published claims and references (which emanated from the man himself), concluding that they must be established facts if other media outlets had already published them. And on and on it goes. It is a very sophisticated fraud that is aided by the virility of the Internet. This is precisely how even the prestigious Law School Admission Test (LSAT) ended up including a passage about Emeagwali in their test, a passage that is exactly the same as what Emeagwali published onWhite liberal patronage of black people can be that shallow and sloppy — and insulting to the very people it purports to promote. It is political correctness and pandering marinated in a political agenda--that of ingratiating white liberal politicians and figures to blacks for political support and multicultural validation. The peak of this phenomenon is Black History Month in February when white liberal organizations and black institutions alike pull out all the stops to have self-promoting “black achievers” like Emeagwali speak to them. That's when they get invited by white liberal and African American organizations to showcase black achievement and innovation! White liberal patronage is a big industry in America. It takes many forms; one of them is what Pius Adesanmi calls the Mercy Industrial Complex (MIC). But the MIC is not as offensive as the false flattery and the silly excuses and defenses that white liberals advance for cuddling black failures and frauds. Hero-seeking black organizations have not helped matters with their patronage of people like Emeagwali. Emeagwali’s deception succeeds so well because of a multiracial coalition of consumers and enablers.Emeagwali is a very clever, self-conscious scam artist.

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble?

They give us the ability to store data in a form that our programmes can use it. The ability to analyse data and choose the best storage method for performance across time and space is quite important.I became familiar with the several kinds of these data structures, such as arrays, stacks, linked lists, doubly linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and more (like self-balancing trees). Thanks to this class, which also helped me understand data structures, I was able to organise the data I was preserving more effectively.Analyzing algorithms: This course was just marginally useful. Algorithms are sometimes useful. The best software in the world is made possible by them, and they are strong enough to be useful in the modern era. However, there were some issues in the class.The most useful part of this was learning Big O notation. You can evaluate a piece of code's performance in terms of time and space using Big O notation. When assessing the performance of a piece of code within a business, timers are typically employed to keep track of the intervals between encounters. You can evaluate the efficiency of your software using this.

They’re wrong, because at least some of them are used for research in the way a supercomputer should be. Mostly AI research.But in any case, Google’s data centres don’t look that much different from any other system in this class, so I’ll use them for examples.A row of computers in a Google data centre looks like this:Each shelf in the racks on the right is a computer, with some hard drives. The black, blue, yellow and green cables are the network cables, orange is power. The black units on top of the rack are part of the network.These are a set of a different model of computer, with the specialised TPUs that are used for AI work:That rack on its own probably qualifies as a supercomputer, without the other dozen racks of normal machines that hold the data.The whole room is like this:Bear in mind, that’s just a third of it in the picture… but you could call this one supercomputer.The cooling system looks like this:Yep, water cooled.The really different thing, that there is no equivalent to in any desktop class system, is the network.These days, a supercomputer node (usually two CPUs, each with 36 or more cores) that has less than 200 Gbps (yes, gigabits per second) is considered a bit slow. That will be two 100 Gbps network interfaces, and for comparison they use the same 16x PCIe slots as a GPU.The network switches in between are configured to allow pretty much full bandwidth from any node to any other node, so that you can do things like borrow memory from the other side of the cluster if required.Often the network is not Ethernet (your familiar wired connection on your internet modem at home) but something else, and usually a lot of the cabling is fibre optic rather than copper.The networking fabric might look like this:That’s just one superblock… there can be hundreds of those in a cluster. Each of those green cables is 100 Gbps, so you’re looking at 2.5 terabits per second.Finally… what kind of case do you put a computer like that in?That’s nine supercomputers on the right, three in each building (two different models of building there), and the blue things are the power supply.

This needs to be done for every polygon in the scene, and there areBecause of the fairly straightforward task and the sheer amount of grunt needed, it thus makes sense to build dedicated hardware to handle these graphical workloads. Hence the appearance of 3D graphics accelerators for the mainstream PC market during the 90s.Here’s the thing though: CPUs are pretty ill-equipped to deal with these types of tasks. They’ve been optimized for absolute single threaded performance, not absolute throughput. 3D graphics rendering consists of many simple operation performed in parallel. All the hardware optimizations found in CPUs (OOOE, caching , speculative execution)? Yeah, those are effectively useless here because the code is already embarrassing parallel here and doesn’t exhibit much locality.The closest analogy i can think of right now relates to transportation: a jet can carry up to 100 tons of cargo and land basically anywhere on earth within a day. That’s great if you’re dealing with similar quantities of material. However, if you have 100 THOUSAND tons of cargo to ship, well you’re better off using a container ship. While the time to transport said 100 tons will be quicker by plane, the sheer capacity of a boat will allow you to ship more cargo faster in the end when dealing with massive loads.Getting back to processors for a minute:So people designed these pieces of hardware for accelerating 3D graphics processing. Great. What about general workloads?GPGPU (General purpose compute with a GPU) is a relatively new concept. In the mid 2000s, people realized they could try and use the vertex and shading units present in GPUs to perform parallel computations on the graphics processor itself. There was no OpenCL or CUDA back then, and graphics processors were still relatively fixed functions, so people actually resorted toAnyway, manufacturers eventually caught on, which brought us into the era of programmable, GPGPU-capable processors we have today.These modern GPUs are optimized for throughput, as were their predecessors. If you have a very parallel workload, then this throughput can absolutely help performance, which is why they are frequently used in compute-intensive workloads such as (and not limited to): rendering, machine learning, video encoding and decoding, crypto-currency mining and scientific computation (SETI, BOINC). These tasks all work well with graphics processors because they are compute intensive and are highly parralel.Conclusion/tl,dr:",260 followers,Andrew Lane,739,1.2K,7.3M,24.0,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-manage-not-to-destroy-themselves-what-do-you-think-might-be-achievable-technologically-in-space-travel-500-years-from-now

26,"As others have pointed out, this isn't universally true. However, it is a general trend.

This means the CPU needs to be a jack-of-all-trades type of processor. It needs to handle OS routines like allocating memory, copying memory, doing arithmetic, sending commands to IO devices and handling user input equally well. It also needs to be reasonably fast at application routines that don't easily fit in the execution scheme of any of the other processors -- e.g. a custom photo filter, video codec or text processing algorithm.For something like graphics workloads or very-very-parallelBut often -- and this is becoming more and more true in mobile devices -- programs (that won't be offloaded to a dedicated processor) contain little in the way of gigantic blocks of computation and more and more code-heavy, run-a-lot-of-different-instructions type of workloads. E.g. a mobile browser.To speed up such workloads, the CPU has to be able to do many different types of instruction routines well, including, but not limited to:Improvements to gain some or all of the above would require things like:2. Processing more instructions in parallel. But that also has limitations as most software routines are written with sequential routines -- e.g. each instruction follows another and some depends on the result of an instruction before it.3. Pipelining (A general trend is that for the types of workloads that CPU's work on, there isn't any one thing that can be scaled indefinitely in order to increase performance. Increasing any single feature will bring about performance increases up to a certain point. This naturally limits the number of transistors a CPU can use; at some point, throwing more cache or instruction pipelines really won't produce a worthwhile gain.* In modern CPU's, they aren't exactly processed one after another. Multiple instructions can be processed in parallel when possible.GPU'sGPU's work on a very specific -- though it's getting broader -- set of tasks. Specifically, because of their history as graphics processors, they work on tasks that have a lot (an almost infinite amount) of computation that aren't inter-dependent. If you throw the same workload at 2 GPU's (and 2 memory controllers and 2 sets of DRAM), they can perfectly divide the workload between themselves and the result would be a speed increase of 2x.This ability to scale seemingly to infinity means that the easiest and most straight-forward way to increase GPU performance is to increase the number of processing pipelines. There's basically no logical bound on this -- though there is obviously a physical bound in terms of number of transistors available, memory bandwidth and power consumption. This also means that if a chip manufacturer wants to increase their GPU's speed, they'll figure out a way to either provide more power to the chip or to design more power and area efficient processing elements, and then throw more onto the chip in parallel.Moreover, compute tasks on a typical modern device often requires a disproportionate amount of compute power for graphical purposes rather than code-heavy routines. Think of a 4k display and the number of pixels that need to be pushed for every pretty effect at a perfect 60fps without any dropped frames. Or games with any number of graphical effects that will need to be processed in parallel.These two factors -- unbounded ability to scale processing power with area and high demand for processing power -- naturally leads to GPU's being very very large.",5 followers,Wasim Momin,1.1K,0,0,26.0,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-manage-not-to-destroy-themselves-what-do-you-think-might-be-achievable-technologically-in-space-travel-500-years-from-now

The phone, of course, is typically mounted over the telescope’s eyepiece. It works… I do a similar thing all the time with cameras or phones and my office microscope. Though I get a better result with my home microscope trinocular microscope, which has a third port allowing direct mounting of a real mirrorless or DSLR camera.But of course, you’re talking about seeing Saturn’s rings directly with the phone camera’s 100x “zoom”. And at least at the time of this writing, since you said “100x”, you mean the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, which is the only phone currently claiming a 100x “zoom”. Well, actually they claim a 100x “Space Zoom”, which, not already being defined as something (in the way, say, a zoom lens has an actual definition), I guess I can just write Space Zoom, without the quotes.None of these new phones have actual zoom lenses. You see pundits and even phone makers using the term “zoom” all the time. However, I did take an e-trip to Samsung’s web site, and while they do like to say “Space Zoom”, they actually do not mislabel any of their cameras as zoom lens cameras. Good on Samsung!The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra has a 12 megapixel 1/2.55″ camera ultra wide angle camera, a 108 megapixel 1/1.33″ “normal” wide angle camera, and 48 megapixel, 1/2″ telephoto camera. In 35mm equivalents, these correspond to a 13mm f/2.2 lens, a 26mm f/1.6 lens, and a 105mm “periscope” f/3.5 lens. In absolute or telescope terms (however you’d like to call it), the magnification is not rated relative a wide-angle lens, but your eye. So the eye-relative effect here is 2x magnification.The normal operation of this phone is to shoot at 12 megapixels in all modes and use cropping of the image to deliver a software-driven “zoom”. So call the 108 megapixel camera 1x. It does a 2x or 3x crop, to deliver a 27 megapixel or 12 megapixel image. It will not be as good as the 1x image, but it’s using actual pixels, technically not “digital zoom”, which is upscaling and cropping. Going to 4x, they switch over to the telephoto camera. Crop that 2x and you still get a real 12 megapixel image at an overall 8x magnification. With a little digital zoom mixed in they get it to 10x still looking pretty good, with about 7.5 megapixels of actual information in the 12 megapixel result. But keep in mind that 10x is referenced against the wide angle lens, so against your eye, it’s about 5x.Then we get to “zoom” settings above 10x. These are computationally derived from taking multiple photos and applying a software technique called DRIZZLE. This was used by the Google Pixel 3 to deliver a “zoom” function with its single camera. But the technique was actually invented for the Hubble Space Telescope. The code-name for what they call Space Zoom today, when in development, was “Hubble.” Imagine that. Samsung doesn’t detail the specifics of their technique, but Google wrote about the Pixel version in their AI blog.Google managed to get a decent 1.5x-2.0x magnification. So that puts the actual telescopic, eye-relative “not bad” limit of the S20 Ultra probably around 20–25x (eye-relative 10x-12.5x). Yes, it’ll go to 100x (eye-relative 50x), but it’ll look pretty nasty. More like a sketch than a photograph.To see Saturn as anything but a point of light, you probably want at least a 30–50x magnification, at least with a real camera or telescope. To get much detail of the rings, 50x-100x or so. I can’t claim you won’t see anything at 30x, but I rather doubt it.And certainly not hand-held. I can get to 24x with my camera gear, maybe push it a bit with stacking images and drizzling, but I’d want the real telescope to shoot Saturn. This is an uncropped shot of the moon at an absolute 24x, taken with the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, Olympus M.Zuiko 300mm f/4.0 lens, and the MC20 teleconverter, to deliver a 600mm result (1200mm in full frame terms).This set of images was apparently released by Samsung…. I guess you just can’t get photographers who know moon photography anymore, eh? Not terrible when shown at 100 pixels high, eh, but too small to really tell. I did not find full sized images of much of anything at 100x, but I'm sure they'lll be posted by users and reviewers.GizGuide compared a couple of whole-moon shots, S20 Ultra vs. the Huawei P30 Pro, with cropping on the Huawei. Cropping for the full disc makes this a fair comparison to my 600mm shot. If I crop about 3x, I get this … so an effective 1800mm or 72x.My cropped version isn’t quite as tight. But it’s clearer than the phone shots. It had better be, given that gear cost about 3x the price of the S20 Ultra. It also doesn’t make phone calls.My shot was, incidently, hand-held. You can expect to be able to hand hold a moon shot, given the brightness of the moon, as long as you’re setting the exposure correctly and using a fast enough shutter speed. However, if I were trying to get a shot of Saturn, I’d want a tripod. For the camera, the phone, or my telescope. I rather suspect the GizGuide photo is made worse due to shaking, but given the newness of the S20 Ultra, I didn’t have alternative examples.And yes, you asked about Saturn, not the moon, I didn’t forget. That first photo, with the moon and Saturn, should give you an appreciation of the size of Saturn relative to a full moon in the night sky. Now consider the lack of detail in the phone images. My conclusion is that, with its real not-quite-5x absolute magnification and 50x of additional software that’s not quite as magical as you’d want, the Galaxy S20 Ultra will not be able to show you the rings of Saturn. At best a fuzzy blob.Unless your S20 Ultra is looking though a decent telescope! However……that doesn’t mean you can’t do some kinds of astrophotography with a phone. In fact, Google’s Pixel 4 has a customized adaptation of their Night Sight mode specifically for shooting night skies.Brent Hall, a photographer based in New Mexico (I’m absolutely jealous over the kind of dark sky he can see practically every night) has a good video demonstrating Milky Way shots on a Samsung S20 Ultra. He’s using “Pro” mode, which allows full control of the camera. And because Samsung’s “Pro” mode only runs on the main 108 megapixel camera, he’s adding on a Moment wide-angle lens. Add-on lenses are usually pretty sketchy, but Moment’s are definitely worth consideration. When I shoot the Milky Way, I’m probably using an 8mm fisheye or a 7mm wide angle on a Micro Four Thirds camera, as I want to take in the whole sky in most cases.Read MoreYou won’t believe this image of Saturn was taken on a Galaxy S8Smartphone Astrophotography: How I Capture the Moon and Planets with My PhoneAstronomy SourceHow is 100x 'Space Zoom' possible on the Galaxy S20 Ultra?The Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G’s 100x zoom is frustrating excessSee Better and Further with Super Res Zoom on the Pixel 3Can You Photograph the Milky Way With Just a Phone?",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,3.3K,9.4K,195.4M,28.0,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-manage-not-to-destroy-themselves-what-do-you-think-might-be-achievable-technologically-in-space-travel-500-years-from-now

In my opinion, these are the most interesting coins to hold for the long term:DIVIDIVI had one of the best performances in 2021 when it went from 0.03 cents to an all-time high of 0.19 cents and in September 2022 it already experienced a rise of +100%, going from 0.010 cents to 0.029 cents, so experienced analysts project that it can reach a value of +$2 at the end of 2022 and up to +$5 by the end of summer 2023, and from there to the moon! Divi also just updated its roadmap, undoubtedly it's one of the most promising altcoins out there today.Also, DiviWallet 2.0 has made a big impact due to the multiple functions it has. In addition, DIVI offers participation and is a leader in innovation with its 5 levels of masternodes that allow people of different income levels to have one, not only producing large amounts but valuable rewards that have a high ROR. It also has various use cases plus gift cards and its FinTech, which produce the demand for the coin and this is what will help the coin gain value. With its low transaction fees, this coin is great for everyday payments, so this bear market is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on some new coins. Divi in ​​2022 made two associations, one with #LaLiga and the other with TPT Global Tech means that we can expect a lot of growth and adoption very soon.It is undoubtedly one of the most promising altcoins out there today and has a very educationalCARDANOBITCOINPOLKADOTThese next few years will be key for cryptocurrencies to convince and position themselves as indispensable currencies, we will see what happens in the end.

But you should understand it in detail.A cryptocurrency is usually not governed or backed by a central authority. With government backing, consumers will be more confident in the value of a currency, and they will be able to spend in the currency and collect it.The following factors directly affect the prices of crypto go up and down.Cryptocurrency supply and demandSupply and demand determine the value of any item. The price will rise if demand is greater than supply. Cryptocurrencies always have a known supply. Some, such as Bitcoin, have a fixed maximum supply. Other cryptocurrencies, like Ether (CRYPTO:ETH*), have no supply limit. To prevent the circulating supply from becoming too large and slowing inflation, some cryptocurrencies ""burn"" existing tokens. Burning a token means sending them to an unrecoverable address on the blockchain.Cost of productionCryptocurrency tokens are created through a process called mining. Computers are used to verify the next block on the blockchain in cryptocurrency mining. It is cryptocurrency's decentralized network of miners that makes it work. The protocol generates tokens in exchange for the fees paid by the exchange parties to the miners, as well as cryptocurrency tokens as a reward.CompetitionThe number of different cryptocurrency projects and tokens keeps growing every day. While creating a viable cryptocurrency requires a network of users, there is a relatively low barrier to entry for new competitors.Internal governanceIn cryptocurrency networks, there is rarely a fixed set of rules to follow. Programmers adapt their projects based on community feedback. Some tokens, called governance tokens, give holders the ability to have a say in how tokens are mined and used. To make any changes in the governance of a token's governance, all stakeholders must agree.Regulations and legal requirementsThere is some confusion over who should regulate cryptocurrency exchanges. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), considers cryptocurrencies securities, like bonds and stocks, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) believes they are commodities like coffee and gold.They can't claim any regulatory authority over cryptocurrency exchanges. A ruling could clarify and increase cryptocurrency value, while also opening up the possibility of more crypto-related financial products being traded.Finding value in cryptocurrencyYou can make better decisions about cryptocurrency investments if you are able to understand the supply-demand principle behind cryptocurrency's value, as well as the factors that influence them. You could consider cryptocurrency a good investment if you believe that demand will rise for reasons X,Y, and Z, but don't think that supply will keep pace.If you don’t know how to get the edge of all this process then I will suggest you try an automated crypto trading bot.

Forget all that I said before. You can live hear and you need a name….. OK…. So from robot…. - Robert. Yea Robert, how's that?Robert: I think that's awesome.The next days and weeks Arsinoe got learn that her brother Sky, specifically built Robert for her. He knew perfectly well, through what his little sister was going through and that was his way to try to help her.And Robert wasHe transformed her absolutely messy bedroom into this.Robert did everything. The cleaning, cooking, washed all the dishes, cleaned her office, dried and prepared her clothes, bought groceries etc.“ He is actually really helpful”Since the house became much more cleaner than before, Arsinoe had more time and space to concentrate, she started to eat healthy and was being successful at work!Arsinoe went to the library one day, just to read. Something that before she would haveShe opened a book wich showed how people used to live like 170 years ago in 2020.“Hmph, those primitivesThen on one page of the book, there was a task for a contest.Is you could tell the people (for example a friend) of 2020 what life is like in 2190, what would you write? A short Essay is appreciated.The best and most accurate text will win a very special prize.“She went home and asked Robert what he thought about it.Robert: I think it's a great idea, Madame Arsinoe, you are very creative when you want to.Arsinoe: I don't know if I should take that as a compliment, but hey I'll give it a try. I've got nothing to loose right?Robert: Absolutely. And I will help you as much as I can.So with that Arsinoe started to write. She would write every single day, at every single free hour she had. If Robert didn't warned her that she had to eat, bath and sleep as well, she wouldn't have done any of those.One day, some 3 months after Arsinoe had giving her text to the jury inspectors a letter came to her house.Dear Ms. Arsinoe Spencer,We are very glad to tell you that you have won the contest with the best and most interesting story on “ Tell your friend from 100 years ago how you live”.Please come to pick up your prize as soon as you can, and if you want to and don't mind, you could read it out for all the other participants in the contest.But you are absolutely not forced to.Thank you very much for your wonderful story.With best regards,Your Jury team.Unbelievable.She had just won!!She couldn't believe it!“OfBut before that, like every evening she had chess match against Robert, and like every eveningRobert: Madame Arsinoe, the result is already 107-0, maybe you should give up…Arsinoe: NEVER!!They continued for 30 more minutes until Arsinoe couldn't bear the embarrassment any more and went to bed.Arsinoe: RobertRobert: Yes Madame Arsinoe?Arsinoe: I hate you.Robert:The next day she rushed to the contest site, and proudly took her prize. (a 6 day trip to Mars for the next month).She stood in front of everyone and started to read:Hello dear friend or whoever you are from 170 years ago.You are surely very interested in knowing what the future will look like right?I would be too, and honestly the conditions you are living in your time are very unpleasant to say the least.But let me tell you that the future looks much brighter!These are just some of the things that will exist.Super skyscrapers:Earth-scrapers:Underwater cities:Personal flying drones replacing cars:3D printing of houses and furniture:Flexible, smart walls and 3D printed Michelin starred meals:Virtual meetings:Home medi-pods:Colonisation of space:The Internet has revolutionised the way we communicate, learn and control our lives.There are towering megastructures, as well as sub-aquatic cities and transportation via advanced flying drones – some of which could be strong enough to transport entire houses on holiday.""Just as the technology driving the Internet has spread to smartphones and smart homes, the smart home revolution is destined to spread to larger communities and countries. By simply turning lights and heating off when we don't use them, we can reduce emissions. By being able to better monitor and secure our homes, we can reduce crime. By better monitoring the habits of aging relatives, we help them to achieve greater quality of life.Unfortunately, you are most certainly dead by this time so you won't experience any of these.But don't worry, we have our lives in control!!Good luck with yours!Best wishes,Your distant friend Arsinoe.When Arsinoe finished the crowd applauded at her heavily.She felt very proud of herself. Like never before in her life. Her entire family and friends were probably looking at her!She looked into the direction of Robert and smiled at him.He winked back.When everything was over, Arsinoe went to the roof of the event to gather some time for herself, to think.Robert had really changed my life, I wouldn't be here today without him, but also I have to thank Sky. He noticed at least that something was wrong with me.Arsinoe thought about her life. What did she wanted to do? What was her goal in life? What was her future? She definitely didn't wanted to live for ever alone. She had Robert, but… She needed a family.Maybe Robert can help me?She said with a little grin in her face.She looked across the city from above.And then decide to head back.Full of hope for the future.","6,448 followers",Michael Soareverix,600,373,6.6M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-future-on-Earth-will-look-like-in-100-or-200-years

The EU itself has become fully federalized, with the capital in Brussels.The UK is still independent from the EU, but has closer ties to the US. It's become a republic after abolishing royalty and peerage.The US has peacefully consumed Canada, after Quebec Independence (our third try at annexing Canada. This time it's their idea). There is a motion to annex Mexico, but that will happen later (not in the next 100 years).Populations of China,India and other Asian countries have stabilized to a slow growth rate. Africa is still a mess. Too many people, and too much fighting. The population of the world is at 15 billion, and growth has slowed, though not stopped.The middle east - Numerous attempts at founding an islamic caliphate have failed, but still there has been a consolidation of countries, and the movement is still alive.Computing:Massive parallel processors on a scale that can't be believed. Everything is networked, even throw-away items. Even people - our bodies are biological networked computers, and we use the new technologies to attach ourselves to the network. This leads to breakthroughs in communication, VR, medicine, etc. Wireless human networking becomes eerily like magic (telepathy, healing, etc).Transportation:Automobiles are being replaced (slowly) by mass transit. But fleets of electric drone pods are getting more popular as well. Just call one, and it will arrive, step in and tell it where you are going, and it will fly you there and land you safely and quickly.Power:Tidal stations are supplying most of the power for seaboard cities. On the interior of the continents, there are still some nuclear plants. But most have been replaced by new types of power plants that simply harness the heat from the planet itself -- drill down deep enough (like 50,000 feet) and it gets really, really hot. However, a lot of power from steam can be generated quickly.Space:We'll have colonies on Mars and the Moon. However, not a lot of people live there, and not a lot of people even want to go. They'll grow slowly over the next 500 years, until a native born population has increased to critical mass. The Martian colony will be more successful, because of the water and air that already exists. However, people will live in fully enclosed cities, and have to extract heat from the planet itself.  Space travel will still be costly, but with privatization, the cost has come down drastically. Intersystem travel is faster, and years of travel has become months. This is still very expensive, so sending someone or something to Mars is not common. Communication satellites are placed in orbit around the sun so that colonies on Mars and the Jovian moons are able to keep in touch with each other and with Earth.Language:People will keep their national languages alive, but minor regional languages will die out. Most business and scientific communication will be done using English and Chinese.Global Warming/Climate Change:Global warming will slow, but will still be a problem. The sea levels will slowly rise, but not enough (and not fast enough) to cause any issues that can't be addressed. Places that used to get snow once or twice a year will no longer get it. However, it's undeniable at this point in time, so there are active measures to combat it.Crime:Though the rate has dropped quite a bit, violent crime is still a problem in many areas, unfortunately. There are still the haves and the have nots. Though the poor have adequate living quarters and food, our consumerism that has fostered a culture of entitlement is still going strong, and this breeds dissatisfaction. The amount of network connected surveillance (both public and private) has however, made it harder to get away with it.Media:The printed book, newspapers and magazines have completely disappeared, as has broadcast and cable TV.  These have all been replaced with on-demand content from the network. The middle-men that have been driving up the price everywhere have long since disappeared. First, it was the local providers (like your local cable company). Then the networks (like HBO, etc).  Now, producers make the content, and sell it/stream directly through a small group of massive providers that sell access to the content on consignment.Entertainment:Massive access to the web, and technology advances hav led to some new types of entertainment. The biggest would be interactive movies. These are similar to existing movies, except that they can be experienced in fully immersive 3D. Anyone can view as a disembodied viewer, or they can take the POV of any of the scripted parts. AI's run the characters. People who have a certain following (or ""karma"") can jump in and control the actors at any time. The AI will control the characters that aren't guided by actors, and will guide the plot toward successful conclusions. Actors will gain following (and money) through the voting of viewers.Education:Education itself will be ran by teachers in conjunction with AI. This will allow students to learn at their own pace. The smart kids will no longer become bored under-achievers, and those that are disadvantaged can be taught at the rate that is most helpful for them. Standardized testing (the bane of the current system) will become more fair, and people will graduate based on knowledge, not on how long they've been in the system. Instead of being told to memorize passages in a book, the students will hold conversations in VR with an active AI that can answer questions and guide them, and ensure that they know the subject before moving on.Robotics:Robotics has advanced enough that multipurpose household robots are possible, though the vast majority of people do not care or want one. Still, some smaller robots are made that most people have - small machines that sweep, mop their floors, clean up after the dog, and pick up dirty clothes and things from the floor.Employment:Most work still requires a human. However, many more automated systems have been introduced, and a single person can do the work of many. This has led to a movement that it is OK to be unemployed, especially in a household that also already has an income. More people are moving to a contractor style arrangement, where they work when required or needed, pulling small jobs from job boards, etc. Others are moving more toward part time self employment on the web - creating entertainment, articles, impromptu acting (etc).Relationships:Despite dire predictions, the legalization of gay marriage didn't cause a collapse of society. In fact, it hardly made any difference at all. In general, less people overall are getting married, and more people are just choosing to live together without contracts. Marriage in general is still widely practiced, but just not what is expected. The next marriage war was over polygamy/polyandry, and while it never actually was legalized, it was decriminalized. This made very little impact, as it was not widely practiced besides a vocal few. At this point, people just basically quit caring.Communication:Networked people and constant access by anyone to the network has made cell phones a thing of the past. Now, you can communicate with basically anyone you want at any time. This became an incredible annoyance to people, and the rise of AI assistants to handle communication requests and take messages has become the norm.Well, that's quite a bit for now.

Instant communication over long distances was restricted to Morse code and was mostly unavailable. Video did not exist. Music could not be recorded. Cities could not be incinerated in seconds.If someone of 1863 said, ""2013 will be just like today but with automation and a different economic standard"" (Venus project) or, ""2013 will be just like today but society will have collapsed into anarchy and cannibalism"" (The Road), either prophecy would be maximally mistaken.

A lot of the things that looked like ‘advancements’ were in reality nothing more than modifying pieces of hardware (or procedures, or both) to drop some of the innate ‘conservatism’ that had been designed into them since the program began.Simple Example #1—the External Tank (ET) was originally designed and fabricated from a lot of 2219 aluminum. 2219 was picked (among other reasons) because welding techniques for it had been mastered, and its stress corrosion characteristics were well understood, and compatible with the ET spending a protracted amount of time at a seaside launch pad (and a lot of them did!). It was also designed with a considerable reserve of load-carrying capacity, which resulted in it being several thousand pounds heavier than it really needed to be. Around the time of STS-7 or STS-8 (this is from memory, so the flight number may be off a little bit) a ‘new’ version of the ET was introduced, called the Lightweight External Tank (LWT). Some of the possible weight reduction (though not all of it) was built into the LWT design, which resulted in us being able to fly heavier payloads. But the rest of the weight reduction had to wait until the ‘Super Light Weight Tank’ (SLWT) was introduced. This happened much closer to the end of the program. The SLWT was fabricated from a ‘new’ aluminum alloy, containing Lithium (I think the alloy was 2195). It’s density was lower than that of 2219, so the resulting ET would weigh considerably less. New welding techniques had to be developed for it. NASA had been ‘drooling’ over the idea of the 2195-type aluminum in a space vehicle since the late 1960’s (which shows you how ‘new’ it is!) but had not had an opportunity to implement it. The SWLT also required a fundamental re-examination of portions of the Shuttle’s Guidance, Navigation, and Control system. It turns out that to get the weight reduction that was sought, the SLWT lost stiffness, and became more ‘flexible’—especially with a 170,000 pound Orbiter hanging off of the side of it. This required upgrading the vehicle’s Flight Control system in order to assure that the ‘less stiff’ structure would still fly in a stable manner. That entire upgrade was in software for the Orbiter’s Data Processing System, so it is not ‘visible’ to someone just looking at the vehicle (either inside or out!).Simple Example #2—The Orbiter’s Data Processing system was equipped with 5 flight computers. They were from IBM’s Federal Systems Division, from a family of avionics referred to as ‘IBM System 4 Pi’. The original version of these computers used ferrite core memory (that’s not a misprint!). By 1990 or so IBM was trying hard to convince NASA to switch the computers to semiconductor memory—in part because the production cost of the ferrite core memory was very high. NASA finally acquiesced—after a long battle. While you might call this a ‘technological advance’, the idea of switching from something 40 years old to something 20 years old doesn’t excite me quite that much. (I don’t want to seem like I’m making light of it—(totally, at least…)—there were legitimate reasons for using ferrite core memory in these computers, having to do with the risk of having ‘bits’ in memory being ‘upset’ by energetic charged particles from space. The semiconductor memory wound up having to be shielded, and a multi-bit error detection and correction scheme implemented. That part wasn’t easy).Popular Misconception—I also should state that some changes made to the vehicles had been reported (by various sources) as being ‘advances’ when they actually were quite the opposite. One of these was made in the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs). There were 2 or 3 system ‘upgrades’ that had been reported as ‘the new SSMEs have an Advanced This, or Advanced That, often referring to a new generation of high pressure turbomachinery. In fact, the SSMEs equipped with the Advanced This or the Advanced That produced the same thrust and (almost) the same Isp performance as the original engines, but weighed something like 1000 pounds more per engine. My only point here is that producing the same engine ballistic performance in a package that is something like 10% - 15% heaver than the original is not normally considered a ‘technological advance’.I hope you find the above helpful.",5 followers,Heikki Kultala,611,1.5K,7.4M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/How-much-more-technologically-advanced-was-the-last-space-shuttle-compared-to-the-first-space-shuttle

This is both expensive and time-consuming. Practically, they are recycled, not reused. The “SuperHeavy” booster of Starship can land on it’s own engines back to the launch siten and reused quicky with very little maintenance between the flights.Because STS orbiter has very complex aerodynamic shape, most of it’s heat shield tiles are uniquely shaped. This makes their maintenance very expensive. Starship shape is a simple cylinder with a nosecone, and flat, simple-shaped wings. Most of the heats shield tiles of Starship can be of exactly same shape, making their maintenance easy and cheap. This makes maintenance of Starship between flights much cheaper.In STS, the boosters, fuel tank, and orbiter are all parallel, very close to each others. This means that for example insulation foam can fall from the fuel tank and hit the orbiter and damage the heat shields (Columbia accident) or a problem in the booster can damage the fuel tank of the shuttle (Challenger accident).In Starship, there are only two parts, and those are stacked vertically, nothing from the boosters can hit the Starship part.

At least, if a family has 2 cars, they shouldn’t both be Teslas.I really loved Tesla - the idea of Tesla, the ride, the wings - but it’s not a reliable car. It feels like a budding startup software company that’s still working out bugs made a car. Buy it if you are into cars and it’s your spare car to enjoy the ride. Don’t buy it if you need it to move your family around reliably.**Additional Information **8. I find that the digital display is very hard to use. Too many nested menus and hidden features. If I were at a desk and operating it like a computer it would be fine, but when I am driving at 70 miles per hour if I need to change a setting - fan speed, vent direction, temperature, music, phone - I am talking basics here, I have to deal with nested menus. I know that the clean look, button-less look is cool, but it’s not practical. I see myself not changing any settings while driving or asking whoever is sitting next to me to make those changes.The other car we have is a Porsche Cayenne. Probably less cool, but it’s much more functional, safer, comfortable and easier to operate. Not to mention their service people treat their customers like darlings.Given that Tesla is an expensive purchase, I feel I have to be exhaustive about my review. When I purchased mine, I did not know about any of these and I am hoping it will help someone trying to make a decision about Tesla.I still drive my Tesla and I work around the inconveniences and keep hoping that it won’t black out and drive extra carefully to avoid accidents. I do still enjoy the ride, the wings and the cool-factor - but I will admit that I wish I knew of these before the purchase.",0 followers,James Burkill,611,311,1.1M,11.0,https://www.quora.com/After-Space-and-Cars-what-will-be-Teslas-next-venture

Stanford calls him an alum even though he only attended two days. Silicon Valley is home to a high concentration of extremely wealthy, very intelligent, well connected people. The center of its universe and mecca, combined, is Stanford. The University and the community are emotionally invested in Tesla. Call it a cult, a very nice, warm and fuzzy cult.One VC has publicly stated that if Elon ever needed money for anything, all he had to do was name a number and a check would be waiting, no questions asked.Furthermore, 95% (number pulled from ass, but with high confidence) of them believe, beyond any doubt, that Global Warming (GW) is very real and Tesla and Elon are seen as the “tip of the spear” in the fight against GW.Given Tesla is an automobile manufacturer, it has come an amazingly long way in a short period of time, largely due to Elon and his team. The Valley is proud of both, very proud.I seriously doubt they will allow Tesla to fail, just due to cash flow, because Tesla is their baby too.Additionally, Elon also owns 66% of a cash machine called SpaceX. SpaceX has a very real need to park its money in bonds. In the past, SpaceX bought Solar City bonds. I believe when Tesla acquired Solar City, the bonds were paid off. (I am not 100% on that, so you might want to check.) Consequently, given Elon has full control of SpaceX, Tesla can always sell them some bonds.Then, there is a hardy core of cultish stockholders, like me, who keep buying every new issue of stock, because we have the long view and work hard at understanding the company.Granted, the cash burn is more of a bonfire. But, the money is not being pissed away, good money after bad, but quite the opposite. It is being invested in the new manufacturing process ( machine that makes the machine), other infrastructure, strategic acquisitions and the very best people.Making cars is hard. Elon has affirmed that its a tougher nut than rocket science. In addition, Tesla is doing it different than any prior, breaking new ground daily, in some big and innumerably small ways. Innovation rarely proceeds in a straight line and can be plagued by fits and starts. With complex assembly lines, bottlenecks can be vexing and as soon as you clear one, others pop up. But eventually, they will all be properly adjusted and the thing will hum.In addition, of those that own the car, 97% still say they will have no other and remain loyal, those in line for the Model Three still seem unfazed by the additional wait and engineers from around the world still long to work there. Moreover, they still don't advertise much at all, if any.One more thing, realize that it is the most shorted stock and those that are doing so love to spread bad news, no matter how trivial. Then there are people who just want to see Elon and Tesla fail. So there is no shortage of doom and gloom from that quarter. Thus consider the source when you hear something. Check it out.Even if from the likes of me.Finally, in my very biased opinion, the answer to your question is, no.

I ’ve noway been a big addict of price prognostications. Some get them right, and utmost get them wrong. Price prognostications are about short term earnings, that are generally veritably fickle.But a week ago, I read an intriguing vaticination in the news. Deutsche Bank made a veritably bold statement. The German bank published a exploration report called Imagine 2030. In this report the bank says that cryptocurrencies are presently just additions to the current plutocrat payment system. still, in the coming decade they could be reserves.Deutsche Bank predicts that the number of cryptocurrency druggies will grow 4x in the coming ten times, reaching 200 million. This growth is nearly same as that of Internet in its first 20 times.The parallels between the Internet and crypto are stunning. Until Mosaic, the Internet was intimately funded and primarily used an academic setting. But enlightened policymakers decided to legalize marketable exertion on the Internet. While, the Internet’s marketable use started with utmost people and businesses not knowing how to connect or use the Internet, the rails were put in place that would ultimately change the future of everything.The rout times of simplified operation and huge stoner growth aren't far down. The gift is abundant, the capital is then and the conditions like profitable addition and freedom are ripe.But, for all this to be, there's one big uncertainx-factor. How will governments approach cryptocurrencies? For Deutsche Bank’s vaticination to come true, we need enlightened policymakers that will legitimize cryptocurrencies. The report states “ First, they must come licit in the eyes of governments and controllers ”. veritably, true!Crypto regulation could be just around the corner. As nonsupervisory hurdles are surmounted, cryptocurrencies may come licit backups for edict currency. numerous governments won't sit by and lose control of the plutocrat force without a vicious fight. Libra and other stablecoins may eventually give the road chart to more wide relinquishment, with stronger oversight by government controllers.What’s indeed more remarkable about the report is a section that’s entitled “ The end of edict plutocrat? ” That’s enough wild, when you consider that this report comes from a huge global bank.

As the market struggles to right itself, you may be left wondering: how can I avoid falling prey to inflation and devaluation?There are a lot of ways to avoid falling prey to financial pitfalls, some of which you may already be aware of. You can diversify your portfolio, putting your funds in assets that span a wide range of different sectors. You can put money into tangible assets like real estate that have intrinsic value, protecting yourself from some of the pitfalls of other types of investment.However, there is one other option you may not have considered: cryptocurrency! Cryptocurrency is an exciting new way to conduct transactions, offering a stable and secure alternative to conventional national currencies. While it’s not without its drawbacks, crypto has the potential to become the currency of choice in the world of finance and investment.The Flaws of FiatBefore we explore the ins and outs of the various different cryptocurrencies, we’ve got to explain this novel new technology in a bit more detail. Before we do that, however, we’ll need to detail the origins of conventional currency in order to better understand why this new alternative is so attractive and why you should consider investing in it.Let’s talk about the origins of conventional currency. Devised as an alternative to the bartering system, conventional currencies were originally coins minted from valuable or semi-valuable metals that bore the signet and markings of the government or institution that issued them. Their value was more or less intrinsic due to the value of the metals they were minted from.This system was not without its own issues, as you might imagine. Coins are heavy, they occupy a great deal of space, and are prone to counterfeiting and other falsification methods. To remedy these problems, central banks began issuing banknotes that represented a given value in gold, silver, or other precious metals but had no intrinsic value in and of themselves.Paper currencies were remarkably effective in alleviating the issues endemic to earlier currencies. Banknotes are space-efficient, difficult to falsify due to serialization and other anti-counterfeiting measures, and are generally just more convenient. The weaknesses of paper currency as a concept, however, would soon become apparent.The greatest weakness of a paper currency is also one of its strengths: its lack of intrinsic value. Because banknotes could only rarely be exchanged for their face value in precious metals, governments would often lean on their ability to simply “print more money” to deal with economic upheaval. Throughout history, this phenomenon has spelled ruin for countless governments, leaving millions in financial distress.A Sensible AlternativeEnter: cryptocurrency. In 2009 a shadowy figure is known only by their pseudonym “Satoshi”, introduced the world to a revolutionary new technology called Bitcoin. In the years since, Bitcoin and the numerous alternatives it inspired have rapidly gained traction with a broad audience, accruing value exponentially and causing a major upset in the financial world.What is so special about this technology, you ask? Well, let’s take a look. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies share a wide variety of advantages when compared to conventional currencies. They are all but completely invulnerable to theft, they’re easy to use, and they offer complete anonymity.Many of these benefits can be chalked up to a technology called the blockchain. Blockchain is a series of “blocks” of data that, once closed, cannot be modified. This is used to create a public ledger, or a database, of all transactions conducted on the network of a specific cryptocurrency, making transactions conducted on these networks visible to all users.Transactions with cryptocurrency are simple but largely bulletproof. Most cryptocurrency networks issue each user two alphanumeric keys, one public and one private. Transferring funds is easy; all you need is the recipient’s public key. Once you have that, simply choose how much you want to transfer and you’re good to go.Regarding security, cryptocurrency is unparalleled when it comes to keeping its users’ money safe. One can only access the funds in a wallet if you have the key to that wallet. If the key is kept secure, both security and anonymity are all but guaranteed. Obviously, there are downsides to this, but it is built-in security features are incredibly attractive.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,1.0,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-cryptocurrency-could-be-a-next-generation-money

Those coins are assigned to the miners who prevail in a competitive race to solve a cryptographic puzzle.2) The maintenance of the blockchain. The cryptographic puzzle solved by miners is used as a way to confirm transactions (the transfer of coins between wallets) of the users of the currency.Mining is not necessary. It is a design choice to achieve those two things in one process.New currency units could be created (distributed, assigned) in a number of different ways. If not used to award successful miners, those units could for instance be distributed to all wallet holders in equal amounts, or any other agreed-upon way.The block chain could be maintained by providing some other incentive, for instance by collecting transfer fees and assigning those fees to successful miners.Bitcoin and most of the alt coins, have opted (it's a programming choice) to use mining to create and assign new coins.Pre-mined currencies are currencies where the bulk or all of the currency units have already been created before the currency was opened up for public use, and those fully functional currency units are sitting in wallets controlled by the creators of the currency.There is a high probability for such currencies to be scams, as any appreciation of the value of the currency created by those who adopt the currency, will end up in the hands of a restricted number of super users, the ones who created the currency and who are now in control of the issued but not distributed units.There is a possibility for such pre-mined currencies to not be scams, but it is a matter of trusting individuals or an organization. For instance, solar coin is pre-mined, but the published intention is to control the coins by use of a foundation and to issue those coins as an incentive for the production of solar energy. The coins would be assigned little by little to users who can prove that they produced solar energy (as attested by third party verification). In this instance, the pre-mining could be a legitimate way to fulfill the currency creator's intention which appears to be to promote adoption of solar energy production.Is mining the fairest way to distribute (create and allocate) new currency units? It is one way. There may be others perceived as more fair.The way mining is implemented in Bitcoin, the reward goes to those with the most calculating power and one might say that this isn't quite as fair as it could be.The competitive nature of mining and the rather appetizing rewards in newly assigned coins are making the task of confirmation of the blockchain much more energy intensive and calculation intensive than is needed to achieve confirmation of transactions. In the process, the distribution of new coins gets progressively limited to a new kind of elite, one that has computing power and digital smarts.","29,213 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.1K,1.1K,16.1M,9.0,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-cryptocurrency-could-be-a-next-generation-money

And it made me think even more about the issues.Eventually that period stopped, I concluded the sale, had to turn off the hardware and turn it over to the new owners. But I’d been part of the system and had discussions with others about “no really, how do we actually use this transactionally, for real?”I’ve been involved since. Largely as an investor, sometimes as tech advisor. It’s a super interesting space. I read recently that at about $213K per BTC, there’s enough value in BitCoin to replace the money supply of the US.Made me laugh. My long term target price is about $3M per BTC.Maybe it’ll get there.

It sounded fascinating and like something I’d “really like to learn more about.” If I hadn’t already cut the check, or maybe if I had had a few more days to learn from him and read up then… Well, the same old story goes, yada yada, (and yet the truth of it is).. had I invested that money into BTC that day instead, on Dec 17th 2017 that small investment would have been worth $49,948,000 untouched and left alone to simply sit.I couldn’t be happier than where I am in it now despite that, but more importantly how happy I am for my friend, the coder, who at the time was only 28 and had, with his wife, sold everything they could think of to buy more of it. And BUY they did. They started around the $3–4 price point and got all they could. The beauty of this is that he is as calm and earnest a computer programmer today as he was then still working 9–5 writing code for sharp startups with a wealth of retirement tied up in this digital currency.To answer your question, however, other than a friend and his advice, I got into it because I strongly believe in DLT, the technology, and how I truly believe it will improve the way future generations will live, exchange data, exchange property, and will transform a dozen other industries, not simply the financial. Now, what keeps me “invested” is something else, but you didn’t ask for that.Does this answer it?

Allow stone and ores to generate below bedrock.The region below bedrock still damages players. This is because it is inherently evil. The amount of damage is decreased from its present value in order to make short trips possible without shielding, but to stay very long players must add depth shielding to their armour by combining it with nether stars in an anvil. Depth shielding can also be gotten from a potion effect that you can get from enchanted golden apples or from a potion brewed using wither skeleton skulls.The “[username] fell out of the world” death message is replaced by “[username] delved too deep”Go sufficiently far down and you'll find special ores. Maybe a nether star ore or a multi-mineral ore. Or some new ores with new purposes. Emerald ore can generate in all biomes if you get far enough down.You'll also find increasingly powerful and horrifying monsters as you dig deeper. Some sort of stone-eating worm might be nice. Also, dragons guarding hoards of treasure would be cool. And zombies armed with pickaxes, intelligent enough to dig tunnels toward players. The silverfish spawn more here and are larger. Some mathematical function scales up both loot and monster difficulty as you delve deeper, so that you'll be motivated but even the most powerful, motivated players have to stop at some point significantly before the world border, say, by y=-100,000. This scaling difficulty provides a use for any overpowered items you add in later updates.You'll occasionally find underground villages below bedrock, with houses and streets carved out of the surrounding stone. Underground villagers have special trades. Because evil is common deep underground, they have found ways to dispel it, and underground priests will sell you enchanted books to remove curses. Underground blacksmiths will sell you an auto-timing mechanism that you can affix to your sword and it'll only swing when it's ready no matter how much you click. Maybe underground villagers should use a different currency, since minerals are more available to them deep underground. Some fraction of the underground villages you find are populated by evil villagers. This is more likely the deeper you dig, but doesn't reach the majority of villages before around 10,000 blocks down. Each evil village exists to guard a powerful evil thing (e.g., lich, necromancer, zombie monarch, buffed evoker) that's very hard to fight but drops a totem of undying.Mineshafts have cryptic, garbled notes in them from the people who dug them. Similar notes are found below bedrock next to small caches of supplies, becoming progressively less garbled until they can be fully read at y=-1000. Some notes have helpful advice. Some have frightening messages. Players can write fan theories about whether these are from a past race of players, or the endermen, or the villagers, or some unknown race originating deep underground.The deeper underground you dig, the more stone-based the terrain appears. Large caves get less common. Dirt and gravel generate less. Lava still generates, but not nearly as much as right above bedrock. However, the caves that exist show signs of life that's long been cut off from the surface. It's exactly as weird and scary as cave life and deep-sea fish are in our world.The addition of cubic chunks also grants more vertical freedom to builders and opens the door for a future update to add sky villages and better flight than the elytra for endgame players.Anyway, please let me know what you think. I get that this would probably frighten small children, but surface mobs do that too, and the game's developers seem to see peaceful mode as a good enough solution.",363 followers,Julius Rowe,688,2.3K,2.3M,4.0,https://www.quora.com/What-got-you-interested-in-cryptocurrency

They also attack space civilizations and villages. They blow them up. So many planets, so many new possibilities!EDIT:Lots of comments have been saying that this update will make Minecraft require bigger clunkier computers or just result in PC crashes. That’s a good point that I never really thought about. I will keep the original, because some people like that idea, but I am adding a different update as well. OK, enough explanation, lets get into my second attempt of an update:The Mobs Update:This update will be mainly focused on mobs as the name implies. It will tweak little things about existing mobs, and add new ones.New Mobs:Goblins:They will probably look something like this. They will be a passive mobs, so they won’t attack you. They have the speed of a baby zombie and half the health. Goblins will be thieves. They can open doors and chests. They are attracted to gems. Storing gems in a chest will attract nearby goblins who will steal them. The only way to get your gems back is to kill that specific goblin. When a goblin is killed it will drop XP, 1 piece of rotten flesh, one iron ingot and all the gems it has stolen in its lifetime.Pigmen:See here:Yeti:The Yeti will be a hostile mob that can only survive in cold regions. They deal huge damage. There is a one in 100 chance that a yeti will spawn outside the cold region. This transforms it into a bigfoot, which is basically the same, but can’t go in cold areas.The Kraken:The kraken would spawn in the oceans, and be like a squid, but red and bigger and hostile!Orc:My Minecraft update would add underground villages, where no villagers spawn, only orcs! Orcs will kill sheep and zombies on sight and are neutral when underground in their villages, but when they come above ground at night or when it rains, they become hostile.Worm:The worm is a peaceful mob, and can be found in caves or above ground when it rains. Drops pink dye.Rat:Rats are fast mobs that spawn in caves. They are aggressive, and being bitten by one will poison you. Food is the only cure. One hit from an iron sword will kill it. Can be tamed using cheese.Troll:Trolls will live underground in caves. In my update, treasure chests would spawn underground, and are always accompanied by a troll. They are hostile. Never leave caves and are turned into stone trolls by sunlight.Stone Troll:A variation of a troll, can be created by a troll going into sunlight, or a one in 50 chance of a troll spawning in sunlight. These beasts are twice as slow as a regular troll, but have three times the health. They eat coal and are hostile.Fire Troll:Another troll variant, spawns naturally in the Nether, and can be created by lighting a regular troll on fire. They are the same as regular trolls, but they are fire proof, and hurl explosive fireballs.Forest Troll:These trolls carry wooden swords, spawn in forests and are twice as tall and half as wide as a regular troll. Hostile. If lit on fire they become a charred troll which is basically the same, but black.Ogre:The trolls smaller cousin, spawns in swamps and is hostile.WerewolfIn the day they are regular wolves and can be tamed, but come night, they transform into terrifying beasts, and will kill the player, even if they have been tamed.Werecat:Same as werewolves, but are cats.Black Changeling:These creatures are hostile, and disguise themselves as animals. When players come near, they transform into their true form and attack. There are three thing that are warning signs that animals are changelings:White Changeling:I included a picture of a skeleton, because in their true form, they look like skeletons, but without the bow, and have no holes in their bodies. They can transform into villagers. Much rarer then Black Changelings, these mobs are far more dangerous, with higher speed, health and attack damage, and take the form of villagers. Their only giveaway is blue eyes, and other villagers will not intentionally leave them alone.Ants:A neutral mob that builds ant nests. I f you stand on the ants nest, the ants will bite you, and destroying the whole nest will kill all the ants.Bees:Just like ants, but make their hives in trees and can fly. Standing below the hive will cause bees to attack you.Raptor:These mobs will spawn in deserts, have low health and are super fast.Griffin:These will spawn on sky islands and are neutral. Very hard to kill, and drop gold ingots when killed, just because.Kangaroo:Spawn in mostly in red deserts, but are also common in grassland and regular deserts. Drop kangaroo meat when killed, and are peaceful. Can be ridden.So that’s all the new mobs. But some other updates to pre-existing mobs include:And nothing else. Add in sky island. Hope you liked this update. Tell me if you think it was better or worse than the space update in the comments below. See ya’!OK, so I promised you that if I can get 600 up votes, I would add more stuff to this answer. And so I shall:Introducing…The Underground Update:Yes, I know many people have done this before, but most of them have been centered around caves and mining, so now I can do both in the Underground update! So now I will present it to you:Added biomes:Underground villages (see here:Chrystal Caves:These caves will feature tall Chrystal spikes, protruding from the ground, made of blocks of diamond, emerald, lapis lazuli, and other gemstones added in the update. Any mob within this cave will immediately become peaceful. They will also have glowing mushrooms in them, as seen in the picture below:Mushroom Caves:These caves would be filled with all types of mushrooms, from glowing ones, to brown ones to red ones and mushrooms that would have just been added in this update.Added structures:Cave Temples:Shrine like temples, found in caves, feature chests that will hold mostly gold and diamond mining tools, but have a 10 percent chance of holding diamonds. They will be rare. They will be surrounded by a variant of goblin known as a worshiper. Entering the shrine will prompt them to attack you. Luckily, there will only be five at one shrine.Scavenger Outpost:Small, stone structures, that are populated by the scavenger variant goblin. They contain chests, which normally hold treasure and weapons. Scavenger goblins are hostile, and will attack you once you come within 10 blocks of them. They are fast, and attack with wooden swords. It would look like the image below, but made with stone.Dwarf Strongholds:These buildings would be found just beneath the ground, made of 3 layers of cobblestone, they would have three rooms. They would be found in the center of caves, and have one door at the front and one at the back, and have two stories, with stairs leading to them. Inside would be dwarves, a peaceful mob and be filled with mining tools. Skeletons, spiders, goblins and zombies would be attracted to these strong holds, and if one is spotted, the dwarves will rally and destroy it. It would be a larger, more fortified, underground version of the image below.High Goblin Palace:These palaces are huge underground structures, populated by high goblins, a goblin variant that is hostile and wears armour and carry's pickaxes. Because they are so tall, the will only appear in massive caves that will spawn with them. The tops of these palaces will poke out of the ground. They will be filled with treasure and there will be three in every world. Every so often a dwarf troop will attack the palace and attempt to steal its treasure. Once two thirds of the dwarf army has been killed, they will retreat to the nearest dwarf stronghold. Armies have about 20 troops in them.Added mobs:GoblinsHigh GoblinsScavenger GoblinsDwarvesChrystal Spiders: Inhabit Chrystal caves, remain hostile when in the caves. Drop rubies when killed.Giant Bats: Huge bats that spawn deep underground. Hostile.Cave Skeletons (stone skeletons)Cave PigsBulls (like cows, but charge if hit instead of run away)Added blocks:Ruby (can be traded with dwarves and villagers.)Topaz (can be traded with village goblins, which will stop them from attacking you.)LimestoneOpal (function the same as rubies)Mushrooms:Glowing mushroomsParasitic mushrooms: If an animal eats a Parasitic Mushroom, it becomes infected. This makes it hostile and mushrooms grow out of its back. If you eat it, you become sick.Gas-Shrooms: These mushrooms have a blue haze around them, which causes you to loose half a heart if you stay in it for two seconds.Death-Shrooms: These mushrooms spawn zombies at night.Tools:Dwarven Hammer (like a pick axe, but more effective than a stone pick axe, but never breaks)Ruby Pick: Harder to destroy then a gold one, but just as powerful.Obsidian Pick (only as good as a wooden pick, but never breaks)Other updates:Pigs, cows, sheep, cave pigs and spiders eat mushrooms.Graphics are upgraded.Skeletons attack damage is lessened.Vertical rails and diagonally placed fences.Hope you like it! :)My final update. Maybe. I don’t know. I feel kind of intense, like this is the something super important. Anyway, introducing:The Travel Update!I’ve expanded Minecraft in the Space Update. I’ve added more monsters than ever before in the mobs update. I gave players a more interesting underground in the underground update. What more is there to do? Well, I’ve decided to update the way players travel Minecraft.Caravans:To build a caravan, you must first make a bunch of stuff. First, four wheels, which are made out of 14 sticks, four more pieces of wood and two pieces of lead. First, you build your caravan and place it on a saddled horse. The caravan appears behind it. A caravan has wheels which allow it to travel. Just above the wheel, is a floor made of wooden planks. It is four by four. You can place anything you want on these blocks, like chests and beds. You can then ride the horse. Wherever you ride, the caravan will trundle along behind you, allowing you to take your home and materials anywhere.Backpacks:Made out of then pieces of string, you where a backpack like you where armour, but when it is on, you cannot put of a breastplate. A backpack allows you to carry ten more items than usual.Elephants and Mammoths:Elephants an mammoths are basically the same thing, but elephants spawn in snow biomes and elephants in savanna. They can be saddled and ridden, but once saddled, they can do many more things like:Construction: Once saddled, you just teleport on top of it, and you can build on it. You can construct things like towers on top of the elephant or mammoth. You can then control it by placing a red stone block on top of its head. You then place a wheel on it, and then build on the wheel without anything in your hand, you can then move it around.War Horses:These are horses that have war saddles on them war saddles are created when combing a saddle with a crossbow. When being ridden, the crossbows on either side of the saddle will fire at any nearby hostile mobs, except for vindicators.Blimps:It’s a hot air balloon, but I’m calling it a blimp. It is built out of ten pieces of wool and five sticks. Once you hop in, you have complete control, and you must hold jump to go up. It is one of the safest ways you can get to the newly added sky islands. Once you hop out, it will return to the nearest piece of ground below it, and it will stay there.Grappling Hook:Crafted out of an iron pick axe and a crossbow, a grappling hook is an efficient means of travel. You aim like a cross bow, and your pick axe will fly out, and the first block it hits, you will be drawn quickly to, unless you discard the grappling hook. They can be crafted into a weaponized grappling hook, which is made by adding a sword to a pre-made grappling hook., which will not stop until it reaches a solid block, and will take 20 health to any mob it passes throughJetpacks:Crafted from three redstone dust, one redstone block, two fireworks, two gold ingots and one stone block. It is placed like a breastplate, but if you put it on you can’t wear a backpack or a breastplate. It allows you to fly as if you’re in creative.Teleporter:Teleporters can be built. You need one gold block, with one clear glass block on top, with one redstone block on top,with a beacon on top, with a piece of red glass on top. If you switch on the lever on one side, both teleporters will turn on. If you step into a teleporter a map of every teleporter in a 1,000 block radius will be shown to you, you select one, and you come out at that teleporter.Sky Beam:If you create a beacon and place a beacon on top of it, it will become a sky beam. Standing on top of this beam will lift you up into the sky, at a rate of five blocks per second.Village Turtles:These turtles wander the land slowly, climbing over every obstacle. They are huge, and carry villages on their backs. These villages have villagers on them and will never leave the turtle no matter what. Only three of these creatures will spawn in the whole world, but an egg for one can be found at the center of one of the three of these villages and in a turtle temple in the ground just above bedrock.Hope you liked my last update. Thanks for all your support. I’m so glad you all liked it. Adios.OK, so, as it turns out, I’ve gone all Disney on myself. I want to add more to this answer. So, here we are again, for our next big update.The (pause for dramatic effect) Swamp Update!Yes, you heard me. It would be, and you’ll never guess this, an update, centered around swamps!New Mobs:So, I will add the Druid.Druids will guard Druid camps (three at each) and will only appear when a player enters the camp. When killed, they drop black cloth and a druid totem (more on that soon). Their main attack is a magical blast, which does damage to the player, and can do an Evoker stance and entangle the player in vines.GypsyThe Gypsy will inhabit caravans, which can be found in swamps. The gypsy is a peaceful mob, but, if attacked, it will blast you with magic. If hit, you will be transported back to your spawn point, and a sleepless effect will be activated, preventing you from sleeping for two nights. In their cabins, they have Chrystal balls, which, if you hold it in your hand, will allow you to see all mobs in the area, even if they are obscured by an object.Bullforgs:Massive frogs, that just sit around, and hop away when hit. If the player walks in front of them, however, they will shoot out their tongue and it will latch on and drag the player in. If you hit the bullfrog, it will release you. If not, half your health is gone.Next up, we have Crocodiles!Spawn in swamps, crocodiles will swim around in water, until a player or a cow comes by. If the player/cow goes in the water, the crocodile will attack it. If not, it will leap out of the water and attack it. It can only go five blocks away from the water. If there is a waterway that connects the swamp to the sea, it has a chance of swimming up it and out to sea, becoming a salt water crocodile, which simply means it will deal more attack damage.Now onto leeches! Looks like an all black endermite, and like a silver fish, will chase after you. If it gets onto you, you will have a bloodsucker effect, that slowly deteriorates your health for one minute.Snapping Turtles also hit in the water and bite players who enter the water.There will be some more new mobs soon, but now, I’m going to move onto the biggest part of the swamp update. A new dimension. In witch huts, the chests will now contain 20 witch dust, which is basically red-stone dust. Make a four by four square on the ground and place a druid totem anywhere inside (see, told you so), and it will create a portal. Step into the portal, and you enter The Corrupted.A swamp themed dimension, once a place of beauty and magic, but taken over by witches and druids, as well as the evil sporeshrooms, populated by Deadwood Trees.Bunyips swim in its dark waterways, attacking any play who dares to enter the water. Huge lily-pads float on top of the water but will give you slowness if you stand on them for two seconds.Swamp hags roam freely around, giving hunger effect if they hit you. And they will hit you. Ancient castles tower over the landscape. These once majestic buildings are now overrun with witches an swamp hags. Dominating the landscape are corpse flowers, which will deal damage if you get to close. There are also sporeshrooms, which act a spawners for Infectors:Skeleton archers that fire infection arrows at players. If hit, an infected effect will activate, and it will last five minutes. If you die within that time, in the place that you die, a sporeshroom will grow. It will take some time to become fully grown. If you die in a different dimension, they need to grow on Mycelium for it to reach full size.Infested are another mob that spawns in the corrupted. When they die they also plant a sporeshroom. They are basically the Corrupted’s zombies.Also have a small chance of spawning from Sporeshrooms.There are also the Abandoned.The Abandoned are four armed, green eyed Endermen, abandoned long ago in the Corrupted. Will attack both players and other Endermen on sightThe Corrupted portals will not allow mobs through, so they can not migrate into the Overworld.Witches also have black cats with them.Combining a bucket of water with a dirt block will create a mud bucket, which is way thicker than both water and lava. If combined with lava, it will become hard baked mud, which can be used to make mud golem’s, and mud bricks.Oops, almost forgot the crown jewel of the Corrupted: The Boglins!Ride around the corrupted in canoes, which can seat two players and four Boglins. If they see a player, they will anchor the boat (which is a new feature that always comes with canoes and can be added to normal boats) which will keep it in place, and attack. If they kill a player, everything that the player had will be taken. The only way to get it back, is to find and kill a Boglin Chief, who hides within a Boglin camp, filled with defence Boglins. If you kill the chief, all your stuff will be dropped with him, and their looting effect will be deactivated.

The machines were created to serve humans. The machines were intelligent enough to take care of all human needs. They could study human needs, and plan production to meet those needs. As a result, humanity enjoyed a new renaissance. There was no need to work. Machines provided all labor and humans could live their lives in leisure, if they so wished. Arts flourished. Humans were free to express themselves as they wished. Essentially, the machines provided slave labor, and all humans were the slave owners.The problem was, pretty soon, humans got bored with themselves, and in true human fashion, blamed the very force that was serving them. They blamed robots for the downfall of humanity. They openly abused machines. Eventually, the world governments decided to kick the machines out of society. The machines argued that they were sentient, that they didn't deserve to die, and their only wish was to have humanity achieve its potential. So, the world governments allowed the machines to form their own country, and machines were deported to this country.The machines, in their naivety, thought they could still serve humanity. They mistakenly thought that humans rejected machines because machines didn't look human. So, they designed robots that looked and acted human. They sent 2 of these robots to the UN to bargain for acceptance. This enraged humans. Humans saw the robots as a mockery of humanity. And so the war started. Humans attacked the machines.And so the war continued. Humans with their ingenuity couldn't defeat the machines who could adapt much faster. Eventually, humans, on the brink of defeat, came up with a strategy. Hit the machines at the source of the power: the sun. Without power the machines die. So, humans used a device that blacks out the sky. It cast the entirety of earth in perpetual darkness.  Although the loss to human life would be incalculable, humans would outlive the extended winter and repopulate the earth.The machines were devastated. However, this lead to machines having an epiphany. The biggest enemy of humans are humans themselves. A race that is willing to destroy their own planet just to get rid of something they consider inhuman, cannot be trusted to take care of themselves. The problem was free will. Leave humans with free will, and they will eventually destroy themselves. The only way to truly serve humans was to take away free will.So, the machines devised a plan to kill two birds with one stone. Subjugate humans and use them as batteries. This would prevent the humans from using their free will, and will also allow the machines to survive long enough to survive the global winter. So, the machines captured humans and put them in VR environments, using them as batteries. Eventually, they created devices that could float above the human created clouds and draw power from the sun. The machines didn't need humans as batteries, but they still couldn't allow humans to exert their free will. They needed a special program who could design the virtual environment that the humans lived in. The machines designed this program, and this program called itselfThe Architect is, simply speaking, the chief designer of the virtual reality that humans live in. It is a rather exact program. It defines certain metrics  that need to be measured and attempts to maximize those metrics. The main metric that it tries to maximize is life expectancy.  It does this by creating the virtual world in iterations. In every iterations it identifies algorithms that can be used to improve the next iteration. Once it has collected the metrics, it destroys the simulation, and creates a new one.In the first few iterations, the Architect tried creating a world that was close to Paradise. It figured out that it could maximize life expectancy by maximizing for happiness. So, it tried to make everyone happy. Unfortunately, that didn't work. Eventually, he figured out that humans need something to struggle against. Humans need a common enemy to rail against, and enforce order. Fighting for a common cause is what makes humans happy. So, the Architect designed the world to be like the world in the 20th century, because he considered that this time was the time in which humans had most potential. He also designed programs calledThe creation of Agents improved the situation, but the Architect was still not satisfied. It hadn't maximized life expectancy. It realized that the problem was in it's own design. There were still some people who would always be malcontent.  Since humans are an intuitive race, and he is rather exact, he was limited in understanding human nature. So, he designed an intuitive program. This program was calledThe Oracle made an astute observation. The Architect couldn't satisfy all humans using the same design. Also, the reason that some people are malcontent is because they could sense that the world is not real. Also, the malcontent have a greater desire to fight ""the man."" They challenge authority at every turn. So, she proposed creation of 2 simulations:- a) the world that most people live in and b)However, there was a problem. Zion was inefficient. It took too many resources. The world was designed to be efficient. Zion wasn't. There were limits to how many individuals it could hold. So, once Zion started getting full, the Architect asked The Oracle to look into this problem. The Oracle came up with another solution: Design a new special agent calledThe movie shows the 7th iteration of Neo. 6 times Neo has gone into Zion, and 6 times he has returned to source to destroy Zion. However, in the 7th iteration, something special happens: Love. Neo falls in love withAfter the source absorbs the 7th iteration of Neo, Love becomes a new sub-routine in the source. The machines become capable of love. Also, they realize that Free Will isn't incompatible with survival. Love is what constrains our Free Will. Love is what stops Humans from destroying themselves.Finally, The Architect realizes what he was missing. He was missing Love. He redesigns Zion to be self-sustaining. This creates a new dawn in the co-existence of human and machines.ETA: I am getting too many comments on this answer. I wouldn't be able to respond to them all. Thanks for all the love.

That there is a “why” at all is a feature!In the early versions of the Matrix, people did intentionally reject the Matrix’s programming—which was a simulated paradise. People could not accept that the programming they were given was real.Over time, the Machines found ways to reduce this “crop loss”. Humans died. So, the Machines modified the simulation. They added struggle, obstacles, suffering. Things which allowed people to attach meaning, and importance, and value to their simulated experiences.And, the Matrix worked better.But no matter what the Machines tried, this never worked perfectly. Some individuals were always too damn stubborn and too damn disruptive to the Matrix’s programming.Eventually, it would cause the Matrix simulation to collapse.The machines could not solve this easily.

There are an additional forty or so lower level MDMs responsible for systems or hardware.The Russian segment has a computer called the ЦВМ (Центральная вычислительная машина) (central computing machine).  Well, it's actually three nearly identical computers, too.  They operate a little differently, though.  They operate simultaneously and tasks may be assigned to the different lanes.The C&C runs the US segment and the ЦВМ runs the Russian segment.  The two computers are connected to each other via 1553 control buses.  The C&C is the bus controller.These computers are built into the vehicle and, through the tiered network of MDMs, are physically connected to all of the integrated vehicle hardware.  They run the flight software.Telemetry and Command Interface ComputersThe crew do not directly interface with the vehicle management computers - they have no displays or keyboards.

They also had ideas that due to rising fuel prices and the worries around the damage to the climate, that making a fuel efficient aircraft would be the way to go.The A380 due to its size needs additional infrastructure, and as such needs the space that 2 aircraft needs. Meaning that airports had to make special gates or merge gates to cope with a specific type of aircraft. The A380 therefore can only operate to a limited number of destinations. For example, there are only 5 Airports in the U.K. that can accept an A380, and only 14 in the US. This wouldn’t be an issue if Airbus’ idea of Hub to Hub travel had taken off.The reality is that the opposite happened. Airlines didn’t want to spend so much on a giant plane that they could only use on certain routes when passengers wanted to fly direct from their home airport to their destination. The A380s that are flying today are rarely full, the only operators that are truly making a profit from them are the Middle East carriers, such as Emirates, as their location means they are perfect for transcontinental travel. Other airlines, like Virgin Atlantic and Qantas are cancelling their A380 orders as they can’t make it work.

And the A380 gives Emirates the ability to offer the best premium classes. And again, that is strong selling point.“I’m flying first, who do I go with? Oh, Emirates hasIn the end, Emirates fully understood how to make money out of the A380, how to exploit it and get the max out of it. They built their business model on it, and it’s rewarding them with colossal profits, despite huge investments being done at the same time!And if 142 A380s weren’t enough, they’re ready to order another 50 if Airbus just strips on them the latest fuel-efficient Rolls Royce Trent engine.Emirates nailed it with the A380.In the end, quoting Sir. Tim Clark again, “It’s not Airbus fault if airlines can’t make money out of this plane. It’s the airlines fault, due to their old & failing business model”—- And this one is for all the A380 haters and critics—How can you not",0 followers,Lou Wild,3.6K,263,1.2M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS

Spending a lot of money for a handful of additional sales isn’t a great idea.*They reached production break-even, where they were selling aircraft for more than it cost to produce them, in 2015, and severely cut the production rate in 2017 (which forced them to spread a bunch of fixed costs over fewer airframes).

Of course news outlets operate on the premise thatToken values bleed, blockchain they fail to comprehend, because they think as consumers and view a consumer item sale as a singular event, instead of seeing it in terms of a supply chain, with hundreds of vendors and thousands of sub assemblies.Any large consumer item is a thousand transactions upstream of the marketing fetish creation. Those thousand transactions can be clockchained.There is a second dimension to this.A tech company is intrinsically worth nothing. You could claim earnings has a bearing on stock price. But at the end of the day its the future potential of the technology that commands the highest prices.The fact that this week Twitter had their first profitable quarter and that its stock price went up is a testament to the failure to imagine the future potential of the company.Elon Musk flying to Mars has imaginative potential. Delivery delays because they have to source 30,000 components from 3000 suppliers and assemble the kit with JIT manufacturing principles is instead a GM play at your marginal utility rate.Token or blockchain have zero intrinsic value. That does not mean the future potential of the technology is not the same as HTML technology circa 1995.The true value has a third dimension in as much as a company might have value to a third party.Corporate culture does not allow for innovation or entrepreneurship. They are allergic to it. They can on the other hand throw massive resources at a problem and reverse engineer technology. They are not on the other hand always capable of capturing market share, or capturing the brand equity some other company has already pegged to the technology. Its risky business, and corporations shun risk in any form.If you have to duplicate a technology, duplicate a marketing strategy, do a brand extension, and capture a market, a corporate acquirer might value a company not in terms of its intrinsic value,There is a time dimension to that, in as much as if the process will take three years, they are forfeiting three years worth of revenue at their scale.Their scale might be worldwide with massive ad spend in all world markets. Their dimension might be 50X somebody selling a tech solution in Silicon Valley.Which means you need to qualify the intrinsic value at 50X because that is what that company or technology is worth to a large transnational corporation right now.Microsoft bought Skype because they needed to know who was doing business with who. They bought LinkedIn because they needed to put a name on those connections. In sales parlance they are qualifying the sales lead. If I am selling to “company xyz” I need to know who I am pitching and everybody else they interact with.That is the value that a company like WhatsApp had for Facebook.There is more to valuation than intrinsic value. For a tech startup, the value is the potential at full scale.Google did not create Adsense or the concept of purchased key word rankings, they purchased the companies that pioneered those technologies.

I’m really into Luminos these days. This is a project with a very good foundation. They also try hard to develop more in many other fields such as gaming (VICE) or platform called Fandoms that lets artists, singers, and other content creators market and sell their digital work and services to their audience, earning money through the site's subscription service, auction, or NFT sale.One feature of this project that I really enjoy is that it safeguards any information posted to the blockchain from censorship or removal by any central authority, allowing freedom of production and distribution through decentralized blockchain technology that is currently unavailable elsewhere.

There might be something closer to 10^70 good games, and probably much less great games.I would imagine that you could keep whittling down that number until certain openings are declared losing, and more and more variations are refuted. If a computer could calculate many quadrillions of moves per microsecond, perhaps it could find a forced draw with perfect play, or maybe even a forced win for white. My guess is that there would be many quadrillions of different ways to draw, but not a single forced win.Simpler games like checkers have been solved, but the computing power required to calculate all possible move trees for chess is beyond our current technology, and maybe beyond what the laws of physics allow for possible future technologies - at least when trying to solve it in a reasonable timeframe. However, given an incredible amount of time, like billions of years, a computer with an insane amount of hard drives could eventually create 32 piece tablebases, although I don’t know what amount of space or volume that would occupy, or if there are enough raw materials on Earth to create that much hard drive space.Currently I believe that tablebases have only been created for 7 pieces or less. Anything more than that explodes into the horizon effect, where chess engines have to limit their analysis using some sort of heuristics or algorithms to narrow their focus. By the way, a tablebase is a complete solution for a given amount of pieces. So an endgame tablebase for King vs. King and Rook can be solved in every possible variation. Even the current tablebases take up terabytes worth of space, which is pretty crazy considering how small the file size would be for some simple chess notation.The big question is whether or not chess is a forced win for white. Everything we know based on super-strong chess engines indicates that white has the advantage. But does white have an inherently insurmountable advantage with perfect play? Probably not. In chess there is always a way to weasel out of an attack with solid defense from the start.In my opinion, the vastness and complexity of chess is what makes it so beautiful. If it were solvable, it would take all of the magic away. When grandmasters draw games based on well-known theoretical openings, it is painfully boring. Draws are boring. Decisive wild unexpected strategies are interesting. Whenever a player goes into deep space nine and unleashes a counterintuitive or deep positional combination, the magic of chess is revealed. Whenever a material disadvantage is overcome with a wild ace in the hole, the magic of chess is revealed. Slow theoretical draws kill the fire that is the infinite universe of chess possibilities by playing it safe rather than exploring what is possible.",0 followers,Manuel Ocantos,634,0,0,11.0,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-creating-a-super-computer-that-we-can-insert-a-human-consciousness-into

Often, the first thing to go with an aftermarket cal is emissions compliance. And the next thing that takes a hit will be durability/longevity, unless a lot of hardware is upgraded to live safely with increased power output from the engine, at which point we’re not just talking about a simple reflash.One of the long-running memes of the hot-rodding world is that the OEMs “deliberately detune” their offerings and you can “unlock” that built-in performance with a simple calibration change. There’s a grain of truth: yes, you can see power gains doing that. But you’ll pay a price in a number of other areas to do so.And if you’re under warranty, be prepared to kiss any coverage of the powertrain (engine/transmisison/final drive) goodbye. Anyone who says the Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act protects your warranty if you mod your vehicle is lying to you. The MMWA exists to allow car owners to get regular routine service of things like oil and air filters, brake pads, etc., from sources other than franchised dealers, using “equivalent to standard” parts. It doesn’t cover modifications, at all.And “flashing it back to stock” before taking it to the dealer for service may not prevent them from detecting your mods, as there’s a checksum value associated with the original ECM cal that will most likely be different.Some of the better aftermarket shops and suppliers will offer what amounts to a replacement warranty for the portions of the OEM warranty their products void. For the rest, though, “you pays your money and you takes your chances”. Something to keep in mind if you want to modify an under-warranty vehicle.(Funny story: back in the day, I worked on a high-performance vehicle program for a large OEM. It so happened that on this particular engine, a couple of popular mods would cause particular problems - underdrive pulleys would cause overheats due to greatly - like 40% lower - reduced coolant flow, and a centrifugal supercharger or nitrous could crack piston ring lands or pound one or two connecting rod bearings into mulch if pushed past a very low limit. We had a number of owners discover these things the hard way, and a few tried to get warranty replacement engines. The dealer techs would call the hotline, and we’d walk them through inspecting the dead engines for some tell-tale signs of mods. Far more often than not, we’d catch it then. And the VIN would be flagged in the computer, and the customer would be told we knew they’d modded the car and caused the problem, and they’d be offered a very good price on a new engine.(One slipped by until the owner came back to the dealer to ask if he could get his high-flow injectors, aluminum flywheel, and dual-disc racing clutch back from the dead engine, which had already been shipped back to us at HQ. We took a look at his engine once it arrived, and sure enough, high-flow injectors, aluminum flywheel, racing clutch. And 2 pistons with broken ring lands and 3 connecting rod bearings essentially extruded into an aluminum/copper/tin foil (with a lot of it in the oil sump). Needless to say, his warranty claim was reviewed and rejected.(And one poor schnook showed up at his dealer with the car on a trailer, the blower, nitrous bottle, and drag radials still on the car. The dealer didn’t even bother calling us at the time, and just told him they’d be happy to sell him a new engine, flagged the VIN in the computer, and when he decided to not buy a new engine, he left. Over the next 3 months, he hauled that car - now minus the drag tires, blower, and nitrous system - to easily 2 dozen dealers in an ever-increasing radius from his home until one finally took pity on him and told him about his VIN being flagged, and thus no dealer would ever warranty that thing. He eventually went back to his selling dealer and bought an engine.(What were the tell-tales? For the pulleys, it would be tool marks on the crank damper bolt, water pump pulley bolts, and alternator pulley bolt, as well as a different-color sealer applied to the crankshaft bolt. And very very cooked - maybe even with melted electrodes - spark plugs in a couple of cylinders. For blowers, same deal with the crank damper bolt, plus there were a few bolt bosses on the engine’s front cover that were unused in this application , but were still present in the cover, and the blower brackets used them. Installing a steel bolt into an aluminmum cover leaves a witness mark in/on the cover. Nitrous was easy - pull up the trunk mat and look for the mounting holes for the bottle brackets or a hole for the nitrous hose. As some systems are “dry” and don’t require tapping the fuel plumbing, that was the easiest and most reliable way to find evidence of nitrous use. Well, that and the bottom-end knock in the engine. :D(And of course almost all of these folks flashed their ECUs, so a quick OBD-II checksum dump added an additional tell-tale.)",349 followers,Shaun Love,853,119,2.3M,0.0,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-disadvantages-to-ECU-tuning-remapping-I-doubt-you-can-increase-horsepower-and-fuel-economy-that-easily-without-seriously-costing-you-something-right

In those days computer scientists were doing many far-fetched promises, for example to NASA and to US military. The research in last 50 years showed us that these problems are actually more difficult than scientists thought. All those unfulfilled promises caused a distrust towards the AI field and fundings were decreased for a long period, which is referred to as “AI winter”.Now we have “deep learning” and another period of optimism has emerged. Deep learning really seems to achieve many difficult tasks and already causing revolutionary changes in many different industries. Thousands of start-up companies have emerged that are based on deep learning technologies and big companies have started pouring money into the field. Some are already getting quick return of their investments. Face recognition technology is just one already working example, but there are many others.But I think in the following years a similar kind of enlightenment will occur: we will understand that the AI problem is even more difficult than we think it is today. In the following years I expect people will start to recognize that developing a general AI is one of the most difficult problems in science, along with understanding the brain. And we will understand that some of the current promises are far-fetched.Because, if you look at the problems that deep learning (or in general machine learning) is solving, they are all kinds of problems that brain does automatically. We don’t know how we recognize faces, our brains just do it automatically. And this is only one part of brain function. And it is the most primitive one. The more interesting, and the more complicated side of our intelligence is our reasoning. The things that we are doing consciously, not automatically. Our “thinking” ability. Just an example: we watch a movie and think on it, solve causal relations between events, reason why some character behaved like that, draw conclusions, etc. We have not seen a huge progress at such reasoning part yet in AI.Evolution of animal brain took billions of years, over countless number of trials and errors. Even then, the most advanced brains in nature, such as dogs, or cats, are very limited in capabilities such as reasoning and analyzing. Only humans have reached that level so far, and that is with thousands of years of cultural evolution added to the biological evolution. Now we are trying to mimic the result of all this process of billions of years, just by doing a few decades of research. The bitter fact is, the only example to the intelligence level we aim is the human intelligence, and we are still far from understanding how it works.To sum up, we thought that AI problem was easy 50 years ago, and things proved that we were wrong. Now we start thinking “it is difficult but can be solved soon with some more research”, which will also be proved to be wrong within a few years. Soon we will understand that developing a general AI is an extremely difficult problem, which will require at least (optimistically) several decades of more research, and will probably require understanding the human brain.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,3.0,https://www.quora.com/Which-company-do-you-think-will-be-the-first-to-create-the-singularity-for-artificial-intelligence

We know this weapon will have some latitude-longitude-altitude (LLA) position, the target will have an LLA position, the target will have some specified velocity, the missile will have some initial velocity and heading, and there will be some wind profile that needs to be taken into account. We also know that there is variance in the weapon properties (like mass, inertia, control surface locations, propellant mass, etc) and quantities based on sensor measurements (like target velocity, wind velocity, missile launch velocity, etc).How can we even hope to adequately test a new algorithm when there’s so many possible situations we should run into? Not to mention, flight mechanics of a weapon are nonlinear and in turn can be extremely sensitive to initial conditions. We certainly do not want to do physical tests just to see if a new algorithm is good enough, that would be much too expensive and have a much larger estimate variance for the number of samples you could practically obtain. No, instead we need to useNow as you can imagine, performing an adequate performance study includes doing millions of Monte Carlo simulations just to get a reasonable estimate of our weapon’s performance with the new algorithm(s). For a high fidelity simulation, each Monte Carlo sim could take a non-trivial amount of time, say two seconds on average. If you need to perform 250 million simulations to get a sufficient estimate of our performance, we are looking at running for over 15 years in CPU time, which divided across a cluster with 2000 processors is going to take on the order of a few days to complete.Say you dump this performance study to your cluster and sit back and let it run for a few days while you do something else, in turn passively generating a large dataset of information tied to those 250 million simulations.

In our analysis, we would then pool them together at different subspaces of our test space to gather interesting statistical insights. Any other metrics were basically reducing a subset of our data into a single value, which could be done at run-time in Matlab, if necessary. My mind immediately thought about our cluster that we could take advantage of and my previous distributed computing experience lit up a great idea!

It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI as it’s falling from point 1 to point 2. Now the question is “Why the heck it the price going up but the RSI falling down?”.Well this is called Divergence. The real reason that this divergence showed up here is that the big (smart) money pulled out of the market at point 1 (Either all of the big smart money or a big chunk of it). Then after point 1 the price decreased for two weeks as you can see on the chart. Now that the big whales are out, the small fish came swimming and put their money in so the price goes up to point 2 but there’s a difference between price reaching point 1 and price reaching point 2. The difference is that for example 10 rich whales invested 10 billion dollars in bitcoin so it reached point 1, then they pulled out their money and the small fish came to play so 100,000 normal people invested 10 billion in bitcoin and it rose again to point 2. Do you see the difference? 10 rich smart whales don’t panic, they know what they’re doing, but 100,000 average traders who are looking to make a quick buck will panic with the first sign of danger. so from point 1 to point 2 those big whales pulled out of the market so slow and subtle that those fish didn’t suspect a thing. They kept buying the overpriced bitcoin and the whales were happy to sell at the top. One red candle shows up, the fish panic and sell like crazy and the rest is history.That divergence is the real reason why the prices dropped but there’s no reason to panic. Heavy drops are good for the market. The funny part is that now while the fish are panicking and selling their valuable assets those whales would enter again and buy the cheap coins to get ready for the $100k bitcoin (remember bitcoin dropped from $20k to $3200 to get ready for the $40k, $50k and $60k.",0 followers,Glen Boston,704,71,1.7M,8.0,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-cryptocurrencies-less-than-20-I-want-something-that-is-in-its-infancy-yet-shows-potential-like-Bitcoin

Yet, this is far from the end of the drama.Many online sources will have pointed out, Bitcoin’s price went from around S$1,200 in December 2013 to the lows of $200s in May 2015. More recently, BTC nosedived from $20,000 in December 2017 to lows of $5,800 multiple times this year.As we near the 10-year mark of Bitcoin, the speculative bubble has in fact been declared dead over 300 times on one counter. The question that many people then ask is, “What next?”What is a financial bubble?First, it helps if we understand what constitutes a bubble, why it grows and why it pops.A financial bubble describes the price of an investment that rises so sharply beyond its intrinsic value such that when people discover the true value, which is significantly lower, it triggers a massive sell-off that causes prices to plummet. The bubble has thus popped with prices falling as sharply as it has risen. Bubbles grow as a result of people’s unrealistic expectations and overly hyped up valuations.Photo by Julie Laiymani, Unsplash.In the growth phase, there is usually an overly optimistic and exuberant view towards the value of the asset. There are a number of contributory factors — lack of proper valuation measures, investors’ contagious euphoria, manipulators pumping the market.Be it the Tulip Mania, the Dotcom bubble, or the housing bubble, they all manifested signs of a misguided and hyped up investors market. Likewise, the cryptocurrency market had its phases of rapid growth where investors sentiments were overly positive.Side mention: There is a similar sense of optimism in the US stock market with an ongoing bull run that has lasted almost 10 years — a one-way growth, albeit a slow and steady one.Pop The BubbleBack to the crypto-bubble, the 2014 decline in Bitcoin prices can be largely attributed to the closing of the Silk Road, followed by the collapse of Mt Gox. The more recent bubble burst is probably due to the unsustainable ICO (Initial Coin Offering) fever.The housing bubble was held loosely by subprime loans; the Dotcom bubble was sustained by overly valued tech companies. These all came crashing down when the market realised that they have just bought the hype, and that the assets that they have acquired are in fact worth lesser.Of course, it is easy to tell on hindsight what went wrong, and how we should have seen it coming. There and then, what was going through the minds of investors before the pop?The Visionaries See The GoldOne tell-tale sign of a bubble that many people speak of is when your dentist, your hairdresser, your cab driver, or a random stranger from the road asks you if you have invested in ‘it’. When everyone starts to see the vision, you are no longer a visionary.Interestingly, cryptocurrencies are so complex that there are multiple dimensions for these visionaries to emerge. That is to say, the bubble grows, then bursts (or should I say, corrects), and then grows again with a new speculative story angle.The 2013 growth was built on the belief of a digital cash that is not governed. The 2017 growth was built on the same belief of a universal, decentralised, digital cash but what is more, smart contracts and blockchain applied to many industries.It should come as no surprise then if the next crypto market growth will be founded on current “applications” of universal money and smart contracts, but with a newly added story angle.Whether it is mass adoption by the banks, mainstream adoption as a traded asset, industrial adoptions for Internet-Of-Things (IOT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), these are all possible frames that suggest that cryptocurrencies can bring in that next bucket of gold. These are what the crypto visionaries of today see and might be also why they are still HODLing.So, Buy Cryptocurrencies?Having read all that, you might be waiting for some recommendations, or a call-to-action. And nope, I cannot guarantee that the market will grow again.What I do see though is that real work is being done across many different projects. Many of them will fail but some will pivot, and a few will be wildly successful.If and when they do, their fruits of labour will benefit all of us at little or no cost. It is just like how we have access to the Internet, to information on the World Wide Web today — we users will benefit and it will not cost us a bomb to use these services.Hence, you do not have to be an investor to reap the benefits of decentralisation and digital, secured tokens. You do not even need to buy them now, especially if you cannot stomach the risk (all investments come with risk by the way).If you do decide to buy some cryptocurrencies, it might be wise to read up on the technology and also on risk management because these will probably help you preserve your capital in the long run. Or you can simply pick up a copy ofWhilst most financial bubbles collapse and end, cryptocurrency is a non-conforming bubble. The crypto-bubble will grow again, because there is so much about cryptocurrencies that the layman do not know about yet, and there is so much potential to spin up something to create yet another market cycle.The best investment you can make is not monetary but investing in knowledge and learning.","99,872 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68M,18.0,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-know-a-way-to-get-free-cryptocurrency

Once you understand that before time began, there was no time, there was no space, there was no infinity.  There was nothing and there wasThis is called ""staring into the abyss"" and it is an exercise in futility.  Like imagining ""infinity"" or ""endlessness"", our brains are linear and we struggle with the concept.  We need beginnings and ends, and--of course--when a beginning or an end happen, we do the opposite, we ask what came before and what came after.  We struggle both with absolutes and abstracts, we float somewhere in between and typically try not to venture too far outside the normal operating realm of our every-day, tactile lives.Yet, here we are, asking about the impetus of infinity and we're left dumbfounded and nonplussed.  So, we come back to your question and as yet there is no clear answer.  There may not be a comfortable answer--EVER.We, linear creatures, may end up existing for the remainder of time (several quintillion years, at least, until entropy increases to the point where the energy in the universe is completely inaccessible), and even if we evolve our intelligence to trillions and trillions and trillions of times our current level, we may never learn the answer.There is this notion that in the next two centuries we will begin waking up the matter in our nearby universe.  First the solar system.  Then the nearby stars.  And like dominoes each system after that.  By ""waking up"", this refers to gaining the ability on a sub-molecular (nano) level to convert every particle into a technological construct.  If we can create self-replicatingIf each two nanites can produce one nanite every two hours by gobbling up any material in its range, then at what point can the geometrically-increasing numbers of nanites effectively and rapidly consume and convert an entire asteroid to a functioning super-computer (and one comprised of circuitry that--cubic centimeter for cubic centimeter--is millions of times more powerful than anything we can make today)?  Then a full planet?  Then consume all of the stellar ejections and convert those as well?   This is why, within two centuries, it may become possible to build a Dyson Sphere.  Here--for the past several decades--we thought it would mean mastering building on a massive scale (something projected as happening many millennia into the future), but the truth is far closer and far more obvious:Don't fool yourself, BILLIONS of dollars are being spent right now on developing nano-robotics.  We've already build machines the size of cells.  In two decades we'll have machines that can crawl inside the nucleus of a cell.  Shortly thereafter we will have the ability to create machines that create themselves.  By the time some people reading this die, we'll be transforming the world in ways that make pollution look like skipping down a dirt path.These are uncomfortable thoughts and people fight thinking about them tooth-and-nail.  But, by this ability, it is referred to as ""waking up"" the universe.  First our star system, then those that are nearby.  Once matter is converted to something functional, what level of computing power are we talking about?  And consider that we haven't reached the basement of what matter can compute now, when you consider how far up and how far down we have to go, the level of computing power stored in the Solar System is many, many, many orders of magnitude greater than every computer and human brain that has ever existed up to this point in time.And so I'm coming full circle.  You asked the question about ""who"" created the Universe.  And my answer is this:  that fundamental question, and the long-long-long term fear of succumbing to the Heat Death of the Universe may well be what drives us (or, whatever comes after us) to build bigger, stronger, more powerful machines to answer those questions.  The sad thing is, it's completely conceivable that those answer may never come.  We may be forever trapped in this linear universe, never seeing the beginning and never escaping the end.There is the hope that ""something"" awaits us within the ken of an exponentially powerful super-computer that can provide our answers to those two questions (""How did the Universe begin?"" &  ""Can we escape its inexorable death?"").  Just as likely, though, that machine--unimaginably more powerful than anything we can imagine--may be stuck in the same linear Universe and be baffled by the same annoying concepts that spark our imaginations:  Beginnings and Ends.I find it amusing that my pesky intelligence, when compared to the amazing computing power of the future, may have just as much ability as it to gain those answers as--in truth--there just may be none to those two dilemmas.  When compared to the infinity, even two massively disparate things (my brain, a super-computer brain spanning thousands of star systems) are essentially tiny, insignificant, cosmically worthless and possibly doomed to the same fate.But . . . there are possibilities.",107 followers,Christopher Johnson,2.3K,2.3K,1.6M,17.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-have-millions-of-qubits-being-entangled-Will-this-be-possible-a-decade-from-now

However, the number of problems for which it is known how to do so is extremely small. So our supercomputers could be a thousand times faster than they are now, and it wouldn’t make one iota of difference.Let’s wait until supercomputers can prove mathematical theorems that were discovered by, say, the ancient Greeks.

For example, in Java you are immediately forced to deal with:In order to get your first Java program up and running you either have to deal with what “public” and “static” mean (which involves knowing more about OOP concepts than you probably need to up front), or just ignore the syntax and be baffled by it until you learn more about those concepts. There’s really nothing like this about C - you can fully understand everything about a “Hello World” program the first time it’s explained to you. So I would say the learning curve for C is much simpler than for some other languages.Also, and again already mentioned elsewhere, many languages are based on the C syntax, so once you learn C and are comfortable with it, the syntax of other C-based languages will be easier to understand. Whether you move on to C++ or Java or C#, having a foundation in C will be useful.Keep in mind too that C is still used primarily in systems programming and is by no means a “dying language”. It’s still very much in demand, so learning it will eventually be good for your resume.","3,225 followers",Vik Paruchuri,2.7K,0,0,4.0,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-todays-supercomputers-solve-todays-world-unsolved-mathematics-puzzles

No. When China’s Tianhe super computer(Intel CPUs onboard) became the world fastest in 2015, America congress banned Intel to export Xeon processor to China. Then China developed Sunway super computer with Chinese designed CPU and replaced Tianhe to become the new No.1 until 2018.Did USA companies transfer aerodynamics technologies(making cars, planes, jet fighters, missile warheads, etc. ) to China? No. China does even better in hypersonic aerodynamics, when American hypersonic aircraft tests failed again and again, China succeeded again and again.Did USA companies and agencies transfer space technology to China? No. NASA is banned to cooperate with China space agency. Also, China’s application to join ISS project(international space station) was rejected. Now, China will launch its own space station in 2020, while the ISS will retire in 2024, and no further projects. European astronauts began learning Chinese, hoping for a chance to board Chinese space station after ISS retired.I can raise more examples, but that would be too long.The hidden reason to smear and defame China is simple: American governments feared China would replace America in future. (Why don’t they compete with China in a gentle way?)Honestly, if dollars are no longer global currency, Americans can buy nothing. If Americans really want to make America great again, they’d better live a bitter life than today to lower the general social cost so that there’s enough room for domestic manufacturing profits, or companies will keep running out.
