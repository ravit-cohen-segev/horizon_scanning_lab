Reactors are easier to build than bombs which have special requirements to be useful as bombs. So, reactors are build first to gain the technical, sicentific and engineering expertise to design a bomb using the desired energy process.1. theoryNuclear fusion bomb was first detonated 1 November 1954 with the Ivy Mike explosion. It used Lithium-6 isotope and deuterium isotope to produce helium-4 reaction products releasing 270.15 trillion joules per kilogram using a process conceived initially by Leo Sizilard again following Chadwicks neutron experiment and further developed by Ulrich Jetter in the late 1940s.The fusion reactors prodocued by Project Sherwood between Jetter’s experiments and Ivy Mike remain largely classified. Princeton worked on magnetic confinement fusion techniques and those not involving neutron flux were declassified and have become the money pit that is known as fusion research today.The practical reactors were briefly declassified by JFK for use by NASA in 1962 following his visit to Lawrence Livermore National Lab in December, and were reclassified by LBJ November 23, 1963, his first official act as President with Robert McNamara in attendance and advisory role.Of the few remaiining documents that I had the great good fortune of seeing after meeting with McNamara to discuss the use of ultra-low cost solar panels that produced hydrogen as stand along power plants at remote locations I read some documents that are still available to the public if you know where to look.Brookings Institute looked forward writing in the 1950s to how the workable fusion reactors would be incorporated into civiliian use to meet the needs of the 1970s — a period of time everyoe knew America would be running out of oil.There were three types of plants, that operated at three temperatures, which meant they had three methods of primary energy production.* Molten Salt Reactor — NEAR TERM — similar to existing nuclear reactors — molten Li6D operating at 1360 C boiled water at high pressure and produced very efficient elecricity at 74% about double standard coal fired plants which ran at 490 C. This was demonstrated with fissile fuel using the HTRE-3 reactor setup which used molten salt heated by a fission reactor to power the hot section of two J-57 turbines. — 1950s — 100 MW to 1000 MW modules.* Nuclear light bulb — molten Li6D amalmagmated with tungsten causing tungsten to glow at 3000 C using a multi-spectral photocell and emmitter tuned to capture 87% of the energy produced and 14% of the energy as waste heat. A 8 mm (0.31 inch) diameter sphere maintaining a constant 3000 C temperature radiates 1300 Watts of radiant energy. At the center of an 18 cm (7 inch) spherical shell of PV stack that has structural coloration to create optical bandpass filters that illuminate bandgap matched light and maintains 150 C. This produce 1131 W electrical and 269 W thermal in a small hot water heater and was described by Louis Strauss...","Well, everything that works “never worked” until it finally did. There’s clearly no reason to think that fusion is impossible (we do it regularly, not to mention the Sun), although there is a question of practicality.So investing in fusion development is no different than investing in any startup. It *might* result in something, and if it does, the payback is potentially huge. Or it might fail (as most startups do). That being said, some of the fusion startups seem like a *really* long shot, and you have to question the sanity of their investors.","I think that Cleanliness is a relative word. For example The t shirt is more clean than that shirt. So same is applicable in case of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is not zero toxic producing, only the thing is that it produces less waste than other sources or it produces the waste which can be Handled or can be reused."

Ok, fine, future automated construction techniques and resource collection drones probably would cut that time down considerably.But just looking at the raw amount of acceleration needed, can you understand now why it’s “so hard”? It’s not just “fuel” due to some abstract rocket equation, and it’s not just “the probe will be damaged by moving that fast”, it’s just a *ridiculous* amount of kinetic energy that has to be imparted to the device.","The problem is not rocket fuel as such. It’s the effeciency of the process. You have probably seen this equation before:E = mcThis equation is more than it seems. What we percieve as mass is indeed the total energy content of the system. The equation tells you in no uncrertain terms the energy you can harvest from any given system is directly proportional to the amount of mass it loses in the process. With chemical propulsion the portion of mass lost is tiny, on the order of 0.00000001% or thereabout, basically unmeasurable without an incredibly sophisticated and specialized setup.

With chemical propulsion the portion of mass lost is tiny, on the order of 0.00000001% or thereabout, basically unmeasurable without an incredibly sophisticated and specialized setup. This number is so low we don’t even consider the mass lost in chemical reactions, although this is exactly what it happens.The dH has a direct result in lost mass, but it’s tiny: 1 kJ = ~ 0.00000000000001 gThis is the most you can get out of any rocket fuel that uses a chemical reaction to produce energy. This is about five orders of magnitude less effecient than the absolute minimum we’d need to have any hope of reaching any significant portion of c.Fortunately, there are alternatives.In order to get to 1% of light speed we need a more effecient method of harvesting energy. We have two that quality - fission is about 0.08% effecient, fusion is about ten times better. Nuclear fission is just about effecient enough to be able to get a spacecraft to a few percentage points of c (1–5%,All you need to do is to get one of these in a small enough spaceship and have everyone live next to a fully running nuclear reactor for a couple of years, without getting cooked by the waste heat. You can’t use a river for cooling water in space you see. You need to radiate the excess heat away somehow.Fusion power could be used to get up to perhaps 20–30% of c with the same setup and the same overall problems, albeit at higher speeds. This is good enough for science fiction surely, but we just aren’t there yet.","The short answer is yes. I don't think you appreciate just how fast the speed of light is and how much energy is required to accelerate a spacecraft.Something you may not appreciate also is that we did not invent petroleum. Petroleum is something that occurred naturally over the course of millions of years. Petroleum is a fairly unique substance in that, in terms of combustible materials, it is far more energy dense than almost anything else we have available. It is a bit of a miracle fuel.

4,"Cray vector Computers through the cray C90, and prior to the X1 had no cache.The YMP 8/32 which is the first Cray that I programmed on was able to add two vectors from memory and store the result in memory from all 8 processors at a maximum of about 90% of processor speed. The cost was around $10 million in 1985, which did not include site preparation .","The correct answer is ""finish in ample time"".The only real point of a supercomputer is that it's very, very fast. In the early days, supercomputers were fast because they processed vectors: single instruction, multiple data. The Cray 1 had sixty-four 64-bit vector registers. With compilers that could optimize for vector processing, supercomputers could do in minutes what might take conventional computers weeks.As microprocessors evolved, they added their own sort of vector instructions, and other means to get fast performance.

The Nintendo 64 came 21 years later than the Cray 2, with more performance on 3D graphics than a Cray could achieve. Before long, there was little point in building custom supercomputer CPU architectures that competed with commodity microprocessors. But the whole point of a supercomputer isn't any specific thing, like vector processing, it's about being crazy fast. So the modern supercomputer is built from an large matrix of commodity microprocessors and, more recently, GPUs. The Cray Titan, for example, is built from 18,688 AMD Operton CPUs paired with an equal number of nVidia Tesla GPUs to perform at a theoretical peak of 27 petaFLOPS (AMD's Opteron architecture, based around HyperTransport links, made it easy to build different connection architectures in such machines).Now, if you have 18,688 desktop PCs in your house, you'd think you could compete, but you couldn't. The big trick in building massively parallel computers like these is how to actually get some use out of as many of those processors as possible. If you're not careful, the time spent communicating between CPU and CPU or CPU and GPU can wind up taking more system time than the actual problems you're trying to solve. So the specifics of the connection fabric and how the software helps to parallelize an application bring as much to the table as all those processors.So, back to my original assertion: finishing on time. Supercomputers are used, quite often, on really complex jobs that are time sensitive. Weather forcasting, for example, is all based on a few different weather models that run faster-than-realtime in order to deliver a prediction while it'll still do some good. There are always better models that don't run in realtime, which are always run after-the-fact in the case that most of the working models fail on a critical prediction. Simulation of protein folding, modeling and eventually predicting earthquakes, modeling brains, rendering for a film (probably more likely done on a larger ""server farm"" these days), etc. those are ultra complex to run, and all with practical deadlines.","They are infinitely faster, but they don't exist yet. Also, they're not meant for the same kind of work. You won't do Word and Excel processing with it. Neither will you go gaming.It will encrypt or crack any password as we know them tough. So keep your fingers crossed that no bad guy put it's hands on it.It can do more then that, so wait for people with more knowledge then me to know better."

Regardless of the size of investments, businesses of every scale can make a profit. While the size of revenue will undoubtedly vary, the opportunities and the profit percentage can remain the same.For instance, setting up a large farm will require more hardware, software, resources, and power, increasing the initial investment. On the other hand, if a small-scale business sets up to resort to marketplaces like #Zionodes for getting a handful of machines, the initial costs, power consumption, maintenance, and additional miscellaneous charges will also reduce.So, bitcoin mining is still profitable for large-scale and small-scale businesses if done correctly. Also, by making some intelligent choices for the initial investments, you can further increase the profits and slowly and gradually leverage these profits to expand your business.The four main aspects that determine the profitability of any bitcoin mining operations are:But in reality, not everyone can mine Bitcoin as they expect. In that case, you can take a look at new projects with low price, but with great potential with clear, transparent background information.

Apparently she had phoned in sick and did not expect to return for a few days. She was a lovely lady but we were not particularly close emotionally or professionally. I began my day in the usual way, but couldn’t stop thinking about her and some of the short conversations Tammy (not her real name) and I previously had when we casually met in the kitchen or bathroom or wherever. As I tried to concentrate on my work, things started to feel a little “off”. But why? Everybody is entitled to take some sick time, and it was rare for Tammy not to come in. Thoughts of planning my day vanished as I started to feel a sense of urgency. I phoned her. No answer. At that point I felt an overwhelming desire to pay her a visit. The Personnel Dept had her address and, reluctantly gave it to me, sensing my unusual insistence that I HAD to see her, even without a valid reason.Arriving at her home, it appeared that no one was home. The blinds were pulled shut and it was eerily quiet. There was no answer to my loud and insistent knocking. More alarm bells, but logic told me that she was probably at the doctors office. The sense of impending doom overrode my logic as I raced around the back of her home. I found a sliding door that was locked, but leaving a very small opening. I learned later that it was just wide enough for her large cat to use but not large enough for anyone else to enter. I, however, was small enough to squeeze through with a great amount of effort, so I did. Nobody downstairs. I literally run upstairs with my heart pounding by this stage. There she was. In bed and unconscious. But alive - just. The ambulance I phoned for arrived within minutes.Tammy had tried to commit suicide and had gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure the desired outcome. Another few minutes and she would have succeeded. She was admitted to a facility appropriate to her needs and remained there for several months.I did not keep in touch with Tammy, especially after she made it very clear to me that my interference was not wanted and, at the time, she really did want to die. I somehow “know” that she is now grateful for her life and is doing the remarkable things she was always meant to do. I believe we all have a purpose in this life and that her experience, although probably negative at the time, has allowed her to become a blessing to others and a positive motivation for people who find themselves in her situation.For me, I continue to listen to that small inner voice. Is it intuition or coincidence? I believe it is the Universe, God or a higher power that is willing to guide me, and everybody willing to hear, along our path in this life. I’m learning to trust more and more as I walk through this fascinating story we call our life.After thought: I have had a couple of comments that have prompted me to add a post script, below. This is a copied response to a much appreciated reader.“Hi Mors, thank you for your response. I felt it important to let you know that Tammy completely recovered, mentally and physically. I was so grateful to hear from a mutual acquaintance some time later that she did eventually realise that she had two boys and a fiancé who loved her dearly, as she loved them, and did in fact “live happily ever after”. However, I totally respect your views. I too would like to have a choice when or if the time comes and it is appropriate. My mother had a DNR (do not resuscitate) document in place when she died and it was followed. I believe every one of us has free will, but on this occasion Tammy’s decision was “temporary” due to circumstances. Had that not been so, I do not believe the Universe would have sent me on such an urgent mission.”","I was raised in the Jehovah's Witness cult and left at the age of 31yo.

Is it important enough for humanity that it would make a major dent. If the answers to both the questions is ""Yes"" then he goes ahead with it. Simple.

But he quickly deleted this tweet.However, Elon Musk's ""operations"" are indeed incomprehensible: Do you support cryptocurrency or oppose it? He said that he would let Dogecoin rise to the moon, and then he said that Dogecoin is a hustle; then he announced that Tesla would accept Bitcoin as a payment method, and then he revoked it, saying that Bitcoin energy consumption is too great. In line with Tesla's image of energy saving and environmental protection.These are all on the surface, and privately, they are determined by the ""two-layer struggle"" that Elon Musk is carrying out. And Elon Musk is using the power of the cryptocurrency market and fans to win these two wars.The cryptocurrency market will also undergo earth-shaking changes due to the battle of the new leader.Two warsThose who are familiar with Musk know that in addition to two very high-profile companies, Musk has been engaged in two wars, and these two wars have never ceased.Since Tesla and SpaceX are two companies that have almost no profit but are very money-consuming, Musk has been facing financing pressure.Remember Musk's cry in 2018? Musk tearfully reviewed the tremendous pressure he faced in the past. He believes that the past year has been the ""difficult and painful year"" of his career, largely because of Tesla's short positions.As an industrial capitalist, Musk is most afraid of financial capitalists. Tesla has also been relying on financial capital to survive to this day: In 2004, Musk led Tesla’s A round investment, and only used less than 7.5 million US dollars of personal funds to become the company’s largest shareholder (Musk’s shares is currently worth 100 billion dollars , the ""cost"" is no more than 10 million);After Musk ""led"" the round A investment, he soon led Tesla's $13 million round B investmentinvestment and soon in 2006, Musk jointly led the $40 million round C investment. Because of the rapid cash burn, in 2007 Musk led the fourth round of financing of 45 million US dollars, this time the two Google founders were persuaded to participate.Soon in 2008, Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy. Musk persuaded Daimler to exchange $50 million for a 10% stake in Tesla, and then he pulled Tesla back from the cliff of bankruptcy.Then in 2010, Toyota was persuaded to also provide Tesla with about $50 million in financing.In 2009, the US Department of Energy provided Tesla with a low-interest loan of US$465 million through the ""High-tech Vehicle Production Credit Project."" The loan provided by the US Department of Energy has played a further role in leveraging private capital. On June 29, 2010, Tesla conducted an IPO on Nasdaq, raising US$226 million from the public at a price of US$17 per share.In 2013, Tesla raised US$1.02 billion from the capital market (including US$660 million in bonds), and fully repaid the previous loan of the US Department of Energy; in 2014, it raised another US$2 billion to build a factory; in 2015, Elon Musk built a Model X stock raised US$738 million; in 2016, it raised another US$1.46 billion for Model3. After so many rounds of financing, Musk has always been Tesla's largest shareholder.In 2018, Tesla was shorted by the capital market. Musk ""cried"". The whole person was on the verge of collapse. No financing and being shorted meant that when Tesla was about to bear fruit, he would give in to financial capital and surrender control. right. (Financial capital controls the industry, the normal way is to provide financing and gradually gain control; in the case of unable to obtain control, it usually means that you lose the financing ability, and finally have to sell at a low price. Financial capital comes back to buy, and then gains Control) This is as painful as raising one's own child and then giving it to others for free.At the same time, Musk began to release ""fake news"" about privatization, which was ""tracked"" by US regulators. Since then, Musk has gotten into trouble with U.S. regulation. ""Iron Man"" himself can’t tell: I’m overseeing you to sit and watch this group of financial capital for shorting, and you will rob me of the fruits of my labor. I will fight back, but you will punish me!The ""weapon"" of the currency circleAlthough Musk survived after that, he himself knew that one day financial capital would make a comeback. There are still a bunch of people who are looking to short and waiting for opportunities to short Tesla. Tesla is still not strong enough to make money and falsify everything.So the currency circle, independent of the existing financial system, provides Musk with a ""way out.""The first thing that Musk tested was Bitcoin. After eating Bitcoin at a low price, Musk began to sing more on Twitter, which has 50 million followers.Musk posted Bitcoin-related content on Twitter on December 20, 2020 (the market value of Bitcoin was only $200 million at that time)Subsequently, on January 29, Musk changed his entire Twitter ""introduction"" to Bitcoin.Figure: On January 29th, after Musk changed his Twitter, Bitcoin jumped by US$800 in a short-term, which was as high as US$32,000.Musk has tasted the sweetness of financing on Bitcoin. Tesla's subsequent ""announcement"" showed that as of March 31, 2020, the fair market value of the company's bitcoin holdings was 2.48 billion U.S. dollars; this means that if the company cashes out the cryptocurrency, it is expected to record about 1 billion Investment income in US dollars.On March 31, the Bitcoin price closed at $59,000, and $1 billion of the $2.48 billion market value was profitable, indicating that the average cost of Tesla's Bitcoin holdings was only less than $25,000 per unit.In other words, before Musk longed bitcoins, he had already ""ambushed"" him.Because of Bitcoin, Tesla also created the highest quarterly profit in history in the first quarter of this year: 440 million U.S. dollars, of which the sale of Bitcoin brought in a ""profit"" of 100 million U.S. dollars, but the sale of the car lost more than 100 million. The profit comes from the sale of carbon credits.Musk, who enjoyed the sweetness of Bitcoin, also set his sights on the little-known Dogecoin. Before Musk cheered for it, the unit price of Dogecoin was only about $0.004, and now it has risen to a maximum of nearly $0.75. In fact, it has risen by a maximum of nearly 200 times in more than a year.After that, Musk announced that he would use Dogecoin financing to launch a lunar satellite next yearCan Dogecoin really ""release satellites""? of course can! If you have enough low-cost Dogecoins in your hand, you can raise enough funds to launch some by selling some.Musk is actually saying that SpaceX holds a lot of Dogecoin and has already raised a lot of money with Dogecoin.How much does it cost to put a satellite on the moon? The NASA space shuttle LEO, which was retired in 2011 and has a lunar carrying capacity, cost $450 million per launch at that time. The current cost plus satellites is estimated to be at least $1 billion or more.According to the market price of US$0.4/Dogecoin, 1 billion US dollars can be easily done by selling about 2.5 billion Dogecoins. It is said to be ""easy to do"" because the total amount of Dogecoin is as high as 130 billion, and it will increase steadily by 5 billion every year. And Dogecoin's holdings are very concentrated. There is an address that is suspected to be controlled by Musk, and the holdings are as high as 40 billion!Musk is winning the ""war""Through cryptocurrency, Musk allowed Tesla and SpaceX to achieve financing freedom.Then why fight against Bitcoin and Dogecoin?This is also related to the ""two wars"".When financing is needed, the market is in a bull market, and it is easiest to get financing; when financing is not needed temporarily, it is best to be a bear market, otherwise the money in the market will be raked by speculators.At the same time, if longing cryptocurrencies on one side, he will be targeted by regulators. After Musk longed Dogecoins, he was warned by the regulators, and his Twitter account was stopped for a while.Therefore, in a half-joking and half-serious way, fighting each other's statements and practices is the best way to make the supervision ""nothing to say""-I'm kidding, this won't work! ?The next time Musk controls the 8 companies, which one is ""short of money"" and needs financing, Musk will most likely stand up and shout out the cryptocurrency he holds.This financing method can not only get rid of the control and mocking of financial capitalists, but also easily raise money. Why not?And Musk’s fans are also happy to support him, because after he gets the money, he is different from other “little leaders” in the cryptocurrency circle to buy luxury houses, drive luxury cars, and give birth to a bunch of children. He wants to change the destiny of mankind and let mankind be an interstellar race. This couldn't help but make other ""little leaders"" start to doubt life and start to think: What do I want to do for mankind? In the future, the currency circle will be because of Musk, there will be more ""saviors"" who will change the destiny of mankind, or at least the destiny of others.",Tesla don’t do “space” stuff - that’s SpaceX - which is an entirely separate company that happens to have the same “spiritual leader” in Elon Musk.Tesla mostly make cars.But they also make:Tesla don’t do “space” stuff - that’s SpaceX - which is an entirely separate company that happens to have the same “spiritual leader” in Elon Musk.Tesla mostly make cars.But they also make:For the future:

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly.

This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required).

Let us therefore look more closely at the technological developments in 2020 as they have a huge influence on information technology.The Internet of Things ( IoT), autonomous vehicles, extended realities, cloud computing, quantum, artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS – a service for companies who don't or can't build databases themselves and manage their own artificial intelligence systems), digital profiling / consume analytics, customized knowledge are included in many lists of technology developments for this some of the strategic technological trends it even becomes possible to divide into the groups people-centered (Hippometry, multi-experience, democratisation, human increase, transparency and traceability). and the trends of the intelligent spaces (Empowered Edge, Distributed Cloud, Self-support, Practical Blockchain, AI Security).I chose the trends that most frequently occur in the business and that are likely to shape the technology landscape by 2025.1. Artificial IntelligenceThe concept Artificial Intelligence ( AI) is not recent and still has greater influence in the world of information technology. AI typically refers to the application of algorithms using vast numbers of data to solve particular tasks in order to generalize and/or to measure other statistical estimates. These algorithms allow a machine, like a human brain, to 'behave.' 77% of customers now use AI technology , new applications emerge every day. In the year 2030, AI Technologies will make a contribution of more than $10.7 billion to the global economy, according to PwC research, one of the leading consultancies.In areas as online retail, health, telecommunications, banking , financial advice, insurance, dealerships and government the acceptance of the AI Chatbots by service is growing. Another of the chatbots is automation, which often simplifies work for workers (but does not shorten work as it is often found out). Within the AI trend, integrated AI and machine learning (AIaAS and MLaaS) can be described as sub-trends that include types such as bots and digital help, cognitive computing APIs, machine learning frameworks and machine learning services.The high costs of AI-based systems will lead to the use of service platforms for creating AI applications. They allow our own data to be fed and algorithms or compute resources to be paid for when using them. Amazon Web Services ( AWS), Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud are well known as AIaaS. Among other providers are AMS. Under the COVID-19, AI will contribute to predicting the needs of customers which are difficult to predict and enable enterprises to manage efficient logistics. under COVID-19. Chatbots will provide 24/7 assistance for customers, one of ""must have"" during lock-down. The use of machine learning will increase due to the need to improve algorithm moderators and visual materials in social networks (which often block accurate coronavirus information and do not detect fake news).2.

Tele-medicine and IoT apps will increase their use to help track human health indicators.Security, lack of international quality standards and potential reduction in the use of manual duties are among the main threats to this trend. IoT allows good control and efficiency at the same time, saves money and time and can provide a better life experience. IoT sensors, analysis of data, traceability and monitor, connected production systems , smart supply chain management, intelligent barcode readers, smart grids, connected health care systems and smart farming are the best examples of IoT-based applications. The following are the best examples.3. CybersecurityAlong with emerging technological advancement and the rise of a variety of apps, there is an growing number of possible cyber threats. The primary objective of cyber attacks is typically to access, alter or kill sensitive information and theft of user money or to avoid normal business processes. Its frequency and complexity continue to increase. Such attacks. Computers, networks and cloud protection is typically supported by firewalls, DNS filtering, malware, antivirus software, and e-mail security solutions.For organizations whose business processes are focused on technology based on data, cybersecurity is a key trend. Security and data security have been paying much more attention since the General Data Protection Regulations of the European Union (GDRP) were signed. Phishing, ransomware, cryptojacking, cyber physical attacks, state-sponsored attacks and IoT attacks are the latest cybersecurity threats. Data failure is the biggest concern for cybersecurity and the black market is still pretty lucrative in the trade in personal information. According to the cybersecurity study ElevenPaths of Telefonica, a global networking firm, 5 G will be linked to cyber threats in 2020, including key technologies such as Ransomware, cloud computing, machine intelligence, phishing attacks, open banking and mobile malware.Blockchain is one way of providing safety , particularly for IoT devices. Originally this system was introduced to store Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Blockchains are distributed networks which are open to millions of users worldwide. The knowledge may only be added or modified, or copied by a cluster of the machine which is not controlled by any single person. Every data is crypto-graphically secured. During 2019, the investments in blockchain continued by FedEx, IBM, Walmart and Mastercard and will likely start showing real-world results encouraging its adoption.In these days, as thousands are forced to work remotely, private data volumes may become fully vulnerable or at the very least not secured. This emerging problem can give the development of this technology another impetus. In crowdfunding, governance, auditing of the supply channel, stock storage, prediction markets, IoT, neighborship micro grids, and stock trading, cybersecurity may also be applied to the sector.4. Extended RealityExtended Reality (XR) technologies are not news at this point, but they are now widely used for entertainment, making interactive interactions more immersive (Snapchat filters and Pokemon Go-style games). XR typically encompasses augmented reality, enhanced reality and mixed reality.Instead of viewing on a television, Virtual Reality ( VR) is using computer technology to create a virtual environment using headsets that integrate the physical world into the digital 3D environment. Contrary to VR, the Augmented Reality (RR) does not create the entire digital environment to replace actual and virtual objects on real world mobile screens or displays. Mixed reality (MR) is an extension of AR, meaning that the users can communicate with real-life digital objects (remember that the AR headset plays a holographic piano).In training, simulation and new ways of engaging with clients, the impact of virtual and enhanced reality will be rising, creating new shopping opportunities (particularly during lock-ups when thousands people go online shopping). The development of virtual resources for collaboration (Slack, Zoom) would make the workforce smaller by 2020, eliminating the need for costly office space. However, AR and VR will virtually bring workers into physical space in 2020.5. 5G Network5 G is known as the future of connectivity for the whole of the telecommunications industry and a leading edge. The 5 G networks will be implemented between 2020 and 2030 according to a vision of Huawei Technology , allowing for the likelihood that people will be linked to wired computers. These mobiles can provide us with super fast download and upload speeds (five times faster than 4 G functions) and more reliable connections.Although 5G mobile data networks were first available in 2019, they were still largely expensive and usable in restricted regions or major towns. This is anticipated that 5 G would have more cost-effective service plans and much greater coverage. And wired networks that operate in our homes and businesses will become more available. The increased bandwidth would allow growth in the IoT and smart machinery sector , allowing large amounts of data to be collected and transmitted. For regions without an Internet service or poor coverage, access to 5 G mobile Internet may be a critical necessity during a pandemic.Tech patterns are not established independently, you may have noticed, but in a synergical way. The 5 G and edge computing technology will provide the increase of computer power and become a cornerstone for the IoT applications of the next generation. The integration of AI, Big Data , IoT and Edge Computing blockchain technology helps to resolve problems with the online and offline mapping of data. AI and cloud computing will be strengthened by the growth of quantum computing. A combination of AI and IoT will result in artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). This will enable IoT devices to analyse data, make decisions and act on that data without human involvement. This combo may contribute do the development of applications for smart retail, drone traffic monitoring, smart office buildings, fleet management, autonomous driving, and autonomous delivery robots.In our view, these were the strongest technical developments. However, the coming developments entail implementing tools and human resources, and we will look at them more closely, as we promised at the beginning of the report.The first column displays technical skills, which according to Udemy research have grown in popularity between 2016 and 2019. Some of them include AI, cyber-security and cloud computing. The second and third columns are the most prominent new technical know-how in 2020. The lists indicate that machine learning, cloud computing, the programming language and other front-line frames are in high demand. Looking at different points, we note the importance of AI and Cloud computing. We can see therefore which tool this year will contribute to the evolution of technological trends.In view of emerging technological developments that are strongly interrelated, companies should adapt their strategies to reality, predict society's needs and provide solutions to future problems taking the circumstances in which we live and all work today into account.","Due to our innate fascination with novelty, people are always talking about ""the next big thing.""

While this kind of talk is prevalent in all industries and niches, it's most common in the technology industry because technology changes and advances every day. While your industry may not be as volatile or prone to change as the tech industry, technology driven change is coming to your industry via new products and services enabled by theRecently, in the world of technology, there has been a substantial buzz about the Internet of Things and you should pay attention too. Experts and researchers agree the Internet of Things will bring significant change to both your personal and professional lives in the years to come. The tech stack that powers the internet of things — or Thing Stack as we like to call it — enables your company to create new products and services, which help you differentiate your offerings from competitors.What is the Internet of Things?The Internet of Things refers to a network of internet-connected objects like vehicles, devices and buildings. Objects are embedded with sensors and electronics to allow them to both collect and transfer information to your cloud database. The Internet of Things allows objects produced by your company to be detected and controlled remotely via existing network infrastructure. This in turn creates the opportunity for a direct integration between your physical and digital worlds. Automated IoT systems gather, report and crunch your data faster and more accurately than humans who manually gather and enter information into your database. The end result is a system that provides value to your company in new and exciting ways.IoTWhat is a technology stack?Traditionally, the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates after frameworks, languages, protocols and standards are defined. Each layer in a technology stack needs to integrate and communicate with the other layers of the stack. As a tech stack matures, it becomes easier and less expensive for your developers — if you have them — to create new products and services.The IoT stack is rapidly developing and maturing into the Thing Stack. This Thing Stack consists of three technology layers: sensors, microcontrollers and internet connectivity, and service platforms.New solutions, choices, and technologies are developing and emerging rapidly in each of the three layers because use cases differ based on industry, price point, object size, processor speed, power requirements and networking constraints. For example, a utility application intended to monitor a smart meter doesn't have the same connectivity requirements as a healthcare application designed to monitor a patient's heart rate.Your enterprise IoT application designer reviews your use cases, device requirements and existing data to better understand how to create value. By better understanding each layer of the Thinks Stack, you make better decisions about the technologies you should use for your IoT product.Layer 1: SensorsSensors have been used for years in a number of different industry contexts like healthcare, aviation, manufacturing and automotive. Now, sensors are so tiny and inexpensive they can be embedded in all the devices you use personally and professionally. The sensor layer of the IoT tech stack continues to expand as internet connected sensors are added to new products and services.Besides incorporating sensors into your smartphones and tablets, your innovative competitors are introducing new devices that contain numerous sensors. These sensors don't need to be connected directly to the internet and they sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth LE to send captured data to the cloud. For example, Sensordrone is a Kickstarter project that embeds many environmental sensors into a small dongle. Some of the environmental sensors include color intensity, humidity, gas, and pressure sensors. The dongle collects information about your physical environment and sends this information to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. This example demonstrates how value can be created by new services that use sensors to gather new types of data from your physical environment.Another category of sensors are embedded in watches, contact lenses, wristbands, and fabrics. Recently, Nokia patented a technique for magnetic tattoos that vibrate from incoming messages or calls. This is possible by spray tattooing or stamping a material onto your skin. The material is then paired with a smartphone or tablet, which lets you interact with the sensor. Microsoft and University of Washington researchers are working on another way to connect sensors to your body through the use of IoT contact lenses that provide real-time updates about the biochemical fluctuations in your body. One use case is to help diabetes patients monitor their insulin levels while using these contact lenses.Layer 2: Microcontrollers and internet connectivityThe second layer in the Internet of Things technology stack allows for local storage, data processing and internet connectivity. The Internet of Things needs internet connectivity to send collected data to your cloud database. Because some sensors generate over 10,000 data points per second, it makes sense to pre-process data locally before sending it to your cloud database. By analyzing, extracting and summarizing your collected data before you send it to your cloud database, you reduce the volume of unnecessary data you send to and store on your cloud database, saving you money on data transfer and storage costs.Your microcontroller is a small computer embedded within a chip and it helps your IoT device store and pre-process collected data before it's synced to your cloud database. Your microcontroller possesses a processor, a small amount of RAM to hold data, some kilobytes of EPROM or flash memory to hold embedded software, and solid-date memory to cache data.In some cases, your IoT device may need to use programmable microcontrollers to take action and turn something on or off. In most cases, these decisions are made via a cloud application, but it makes sense to use programmable microcontrollers when a sensor detects something that could affect the health and safety of your end customers.The main and most important capability of this layer is networking, which is either wireless or wired. If a device is stationary and can access an external power source, a wired network is sufficient, but a wired network doesn't make sense for many IoT use cases because physical cables are needed to connect to the network. WiFi, wireless modems, and wireless mesh networks are the most common ways IoT devices are connected to the internet.If you plan to manufacture an IoT device you must keep in mind dependencies for your use cases. Is your device mobile or fixed? Does your device need a battery or is it connected to a fixed power supply? How much data do you need to transfer to your cloud database per hour? Should your device's connectivity be episodic or continuous?Devices you use to track your health and fitness while bicycling, running, and exercising store data while you're active, and these devices use episodic connectivity. Your device then syncs with the cloud when it's close to your smartphone or tablet. Compare this to the continuous connectivity needed by Amazon Echo's voice based digital assistant who is always listening for your commands, fetching answers from the internet the instant you ask a question. Depending on your IoT product's use cases, you may need continuous connectivity.When you research Think Stack vendors, you'll notice a wide range of different networking protocols, hardware, software, and architectures are used to build IoT products. Due to the variation in use cases and environments, you have many choices when it comes to adding networking and computing capabilities your IoT device. While some vendors focus more on hardware components, other vendors provide a system of integrated software and hardware. Sometimes, IoT software solutions spill into the third layer of the Thing Stack, which is referred to as the service platform.Layer 3: Service platformsThe first two layers for the Thing Stack embed sensor and microcomputers in your IoT device, but your IoT product profits from the service platform layer. This layer delivers value to your customers by automating processes and delivering rich data analytics. Your cloud application combines data collected from numerous IoT sensors with your (or your customers) other business data to produce insights that generate business value.It's important for your service platform to create a feedback loop between your IoT devices and you device management software, so you and your customers can upgrade, monitor, and maintain the firmware on each the device. In most cases, service platforms operate on cloud infrastructure and utilize a multi-tenant software architecture to deliver a seamless software-as-a-service (SaaS) experience.The convergence between our digital and physical worlds stresses your IT operations by increasing demand for data management, storage, tagging and analysis. It's in your company's best interests to build your IoT service platform on robust cloud infrastructure, so you can scale infinitely as your business grows with your new IoT product.While ""software is eating the world"" as Marc Andreessen said, consumers and companies still purchase a lot of physical things. If you build a robust IoT service platform, you obtain insights about how your customers use your IoT products and services. With a great IoT service platform you can manage post-transaction relationships in new and engaging ways.Because service platforms store and make decisions based on data collected from all types of IoT devices, they are often considered the backbone of post-transactions relationships. What if you reached out to customers who never powered on your IoT device and proactively on-boarded them? What if you used anonymized data from customers getting the most value out of your product to help other customers unlock more business value?Now is the time to build your IoT product because sensors keep getting smaller and network connectivity solutions keep getting better. Create a plan to engage with your customers and facilitate goal-oriented post-transaction relationships, leading to new opportunities to turn a single transaction into a strong relationship.How to extract value from the Thing Stack?The Thing Stack isn't just for emerging companies or technology companies. The Thing Stack will revolutionize your industry and create efficiencies and new products your customers love. With end-to-end IoT solutions, you can now redefine your relationship customers and create new data-driven goal oriented outcomes. When you can measure everything, you can identify problems your customers have early and intervene to create positive outcomes.Now that you understand the Thing Stack, it's up to you to create an IoT product that changes the way you interact with your customers.","The Internet has already changed the world in a big way.

Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume.

The latency for an Earth-Mars internet connection varies according Distance between the planets, which in turn depends on where the planets are in their orbits. This is in is in the previously mentioned 15-45 minute range.So, if you are sending the Great Martian Novel to your publisher on Earth, whoosh! it's sent in a second, takes a while (15-45 minutes) to get to Earth, and is received in a second. An indication that the data was successfully received is sent, which arrives after a while and indicates that the temporary copy of the data won't be needed for retransmission.On the other hand, trying to do a video chat with your snugums back on Earth will be awful. It will be 4K resolution, at a minimum, but you will have to wait at least half an hour and up to an hour and a half from saying, ""I love you"", until you know whether she/he responds in the way you hope. The same kind of delay will apply if you try to view a Web page on Earth. The result is that it isn't slow, but it will sure feel like it is.So, the connection will be fast and that will be enough for some purposes, but woefully inadequate for others.[I actually described a simple minded send data/wait for acknowledgement/retransmit if request approach. Actually, it work work like that. All data will be send with extra bits to make it likely that it can be reconstructed even if hit by a burst of static. There are then two kinds of data: those that it's okay to lose some of occasionally, like video feeds, and those where no loss is acceptable, like the high resolution image of the first Martian life form. If a chunk of the first type of data is smashed, you just toss it. It is the second type of data where you need an acknowledgement from the receiver saying that the data was successfully received or that it must be resent.

But, only toBy going faster, or decreasing transit times to Mars, he hopes to decrease the radiation exposure of passengers. While blocking is being worked on, with medical injections, radiation shielding, and the like, those are not full proof. We are a long way from the Star Trek shields.

So , he is with NASA’s blessing and his own money, developing in-orbit refueling of his Star Ships, with reusable tankers. Full Propellant Tanks will provide energy to speed up the transit. But, only to a point. There comes a time, when the additional propellant becomes a hindrance because of it’s extra weight. More propellant, means more weight, which requires more propellant, etc, etc… It’s calledSo, SpaceX is working on other forms of propulsion. Nothing public yet. It’s all hush! hush! Gwynne Shotwell mentioned in a forum of commercial space leaders. 5 years ago, that she hoped in 25 years, SpaceX would be working on Interstellar Propulsion.I have mentioned many times, that all of Elon Musk’s companies form a Skunk Works, with many advanced technological abilities and intellectual capabilities amongst their employees. I suspect , he has developed his own Intranet, based around a super computer of the Skunk Work’s Own Design. It should also be mentioned that Space Exploration Systems, (SpaceX). Star Ship, Star Link, are most probably aspirations to take humanity beyond our Solar System. Not just fancy names. Mars is just a first step.","Look back at any speculative TV program from a few decades ago and many of their ideas raise a smile. Flying cars, Martian colonies, nutritional pills as food- all of these were presented with breathless enthusiasm. Remember the early 1980`s mobile phones with their huge batteries ? The point is that reality overtakes speculation. There are nascent technologies and theories that “could” lead to successful interstellar travel. On the other hand they might turn out to be dead ends. Just for fun: I suspect that we will be travelling within our solar system reasonably quickly within 500 years.

Travel time to Mars could be weeks rather than months. There are a lot of resources for us to gather within our own system, so even 500 years from now interstellar travel will remain within the realm of science - unmanned probes are more likely than lantern jawed astronauts. There may be a manned expedition to one of our closest stars, launched with great fanfare and as much a political `stunt` as anything. Realistically they will spend decades in transit, probably spending long periods in some form of tupor / `suspended animation` if such a thing can be achieved. What we can hope for here in the dark ages is that our descendants will discover game changing new science that allows the famous warp drive of Sci-fi fame"
22,"If you could create aan AI system that uses magnetic free energy and solar powerthen 10000 a week (dollars? Shekels? BTC?) would be merely the start. I would confidently predict that you could be the richest person on earth in a matter of months, maybe less.","This would have to be in the following field.Id say the next billionaire in these industries are sitting at home and do not even know it yet.It all starts with an idea, think about Elon Musk here.Hope this helps.","I’m going to talk about the idea of blue oceans and red oceans.Red oceans represent every market that is currently occupied, and the competition within it. For example, it is entirely possible to create a pizza restaurant chain and be successful with it. But it is competing in a red ocean - Dominoes, Pizza hut, Papa Johns Etc…The opportunities are limited in this market.Blue oceans on the other haI’m going to talk about the idea of blue oceans and red oceans.Red oceans represent every market that is currently occupied, and the competition within it. For example, it is entirely possible to create a pizza restaurant chain and be successful with it. But it is competing in a red ocean - Dominoes, Pizza hut, Papa Johns Etc…The opportunities are limited in this market.Blue oceans on the other hand are a new sector or industry that are unoccupied with competition. They are usually created from advances in technology or inventions. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over.The biggest blue ocean market that has probably ever been created is the internet (split into different sectors). Think of how many companies exist and compete exclusively through it. An example of a new blue ocean that springs to mind is self-driving vehicles. You could say that Tesla and Elon Musk were responsible for creating this. There are currently no true competitors in this ocean, because the technology isn't there yet.The general idea is that billion..."
