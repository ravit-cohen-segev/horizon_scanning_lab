And, these are eternal characters. We’ve had over seventy-five great years of Captain America stories in the comics – only a spattering of those have been touched on in the films.

Car wrecking is a major entertainment device in some types of movies.If the characters do drive normally, they are not focused on the road. Instead, they talk, and look at other passengers.Some movies forget all about it, others overdo it. Either way, it is sometimes easy to notice something’s wrong.Here are a link to the article talking about it.In movies, everyone who finds or has a gun, can shoot with great precision. Almost no one misses, no one is afraid to hold a weapon, and no one panicks when their life is at stake. Even those characters who are supposed to know nothing about weapons, act like professionals.Edit: This applies to heroes whose job is to get rid of the bad guys. Villains are horrible at shooting and they almost always miss.Either way, I’m sure people should practice shooting to become good at it. No one is born with this skill.In movies and TV serials, whenever there is an accident, and a character needs medical intervention, they are followed by their worried family members. It's not unusual to see siblings, spouses, aunts and uncles or in-laws entering the patient's room or even the operating theatre (this is a common mistake in some medical drama series).In reality, a nurse would kick almost everyone out, especially if they don't come during visiting hours. Family members are, in most cases, not permitted in the operating room.I wasn't really sure about this one, so I checked it out. Apparently, a car won't explode or burst into flames if the gas tank is shot with bullets.There was even an experiment conducted:AIn American movies, foreigners are usually portrayed in the negative light, especially if they come from non-English speaking countries.Foreigners are presented as dangerous (mobsters from different countries), they are sometimes mocked at for their lifestyle, or the foreigners' representation in movies is based on the most common stereotypes.Either way, they are rarely presented in a neutral or realistic way.Photo sources:The Top 9 Movies That Killed The Most Cars - StangTVIt's ComplicatedKill the Irishman - WikipediaLethal Weapon Collection, The (US - BD)","10,732 followers",Craig Weiler,859,3.9K,34M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-the-Avengers-warn-the-rest-of-the-earth-that-an-impending-war-is-coming

He said, and I quote: “… … …”Nothing. Nada.You are probably all familiar with kremlebots’ playbook about how Putin pulled the country out of devastation wrought by “liberals” in the 1990s and brought prosperity to millions with his iron fist.Let me present you with an alternative narrative that is gaining some very serious traction with Russian people. The list is much longer than can fit in this answer.It took the Soviet Union only 16 years to send the first man into space after the end of World War II. In 20 years, Russia hasn’t learned to design its own computer, a machine tool, pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment and much more.Local factories have been shut down, and giant Western groups like VW, Citroen, BMW, KIA., etc. have opened factories in their place with ownership, management and technology coming from overseas. The profits are split between the Western corporations, oligarchs and officials.The national currency, the ruble, has jumped from 28.16 to 74.02 against USD with prices rising accordingly, while wages stagnated, as more money hasn’t been printed, possibly to avoid a runaway hyperinflation.Pump price for gas rose by 483% (from 7.2 to 42). In case you didn't know, most of Russia’s revenues come from exporting crude oil.The number of officialsThe population of Russia is roughly the same as 20 years ago, while millions of migrants have received citizenship in that period of time. At least 150,000 citizens, many of whom with excellent education and sellable skills, leave the country for good each year.Russia spends more budget money on defence than on education and healthcare combined.The number of hospitals fell by 50% (from 10,700 to 5,300). This actually points out to a logical conclusion thatThe number of schools fell by 21% (from 68,100 to 41,349). This highlights the fact that most of the country has seen decline in population. People migrate to bigger cities and towns in search of work where they overwhelm the existing schools. The quality of education inevitably suffers.At the same time, the number of Orthodox churches had doubled from 19,000 to 38,649, while the level of religiosity in the population hasn’t risen. Why are they building more churches, then? Because Russian Orthodox Church is a state corporation that exists for the sole objective of making its stakeholders and top management wealthy, which has been proven by photos and videos of high-flying lifestyle of thousands of priests.According to just two polls: median salary is 15k/month or $200/month, and a third of the population don’t have enough money to buy footwear for all members of the family. When asked to comment, Putin claimed that 17k a month is a middle class salary.At the same time, Russia is on the 3rd place in the world by the number of billionaires. The largest super-yachts and most expensive real estate in the world belong to Russian oligarchs.Don’t listen to Kremlebots when they tell you Putin has built a country Russians want their children to live in.

There are lots of people nastier than him who commit wholesale atrocities, but they aren’t quite in the same league in the villain popularity contest. There’s something in how he is perceived that makes a difference.Internationally, I think he is especially “bad” because he chose a very annoying role of a spoiler. He breaks rules in a specially irritating manner. Let me try to explain. You know how in most companies people who leave write farewell letters to everyone where they use a lot of words about how it was a great experience for them and they learned so much and it’s been a great honor to work in such a great team and so on and so forth? Surely sometimes parts of it is true but mostly it’s just some sort of a ritual and often these people hate the organization and most other people in it. And everybody knows that. Yet nobody ever replies to such emails trying to expose the hypocrisy. If someone tried, what would he cause? Irritation! And then somebody has a birthday, people go to congratulate the person, and someone stands up and says that birthdays are overrated and all the congratulations are fake. And that kind of stuff keeps happening at every corporate event. Or, worse still, imagine there’s a compensation policy that’s ever so slightly but universally abused. Like you have company cars that are supposed to be used for business but people routinely use them to take kids to school, adding a few miles now and then, or occasionally take small trips out of town. Or at least when they use them improperly, they hide it or invent plausible explanations. And then our grumpy fellow takes such a car and goes on a long vacation across Europe, posting photos on Instagram at every stop. Then somebody tries to talk sense into him, but instead of complying he starts running around yelling how everybody does it. And what if the guy is also a bad performer, adding little useful to the business? If you can’t fire him (and surely nobody can fire Putin), his very presence will soon be a torture to everyone.Politics require a very delicate balance of rules, rituals, hypocrisy, principles, and a lot of other things. If you disturb this balance, you tear the fabric of the world order apart. And become a bad guy. If you also do bad things, they will constitute most of your image.I think that’s why Putin is a very special kind of bad.","43,149 followers",Misha Firer,11.6K,1.3K,132.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-the-Avengers-warn-the-rest-of-the-earth-that-an-impending-war-is-coming

Obama once said its economy “was in tatters.” It wasn’t true then or now.I answered several questions at Quora with facts that the Western press rarely if ever mentions:His administration has done a lot to diversify the Russian economy, which now manufactures almost anything a Russian would want to buy, including autos and tools, and is busy building factories and exporting manufactured goods. It also is one of the world’s foremost leaders in nuclear energy, building and maintaining plants and selling nuclear fuel and nuclear products for medicine not only at home but also abroad in a wide range of other states. Further, it is the second biggest arms exporter and that is due in large part to the fact that the US jealously guards its no. one spot by slapping sanctions on states that buy Russian arms or at least threatening them with sanctions. Ironically, it was the first major round of sanctions in 2014 that indirectly led Russia to impose its own sanctions on Europe, refusing to continue buying their farm products and launching an ambitious campaign aimed at achieving Russian food security. It was a smashing success and the products that were substituted will never again be imported from Europe. It was a big loss for Europe.In addition, Russia is the world’s no. 2 ship builder and is planning to build ships for export. It also earns revenues from its operation of the Arctic Shipping route, which is considerably shorter than the route passing through the Suez Canal and could eventually replace that route for shipping between Europe and Asia.Russia has also exhibited its breakthrough developments in quantum techonogies, including a pioneering supercomputer.Finally, Russia was the first to come out with an anti-covid vaccine, Sputnik V, which was initially scoffed at in the West. Later, it was tested and found by the renowned medical journal Lancet to be safe and efficacious. The childish US goverenment has refused to consider it, even though it has had the highest covid death rate in the world. The EU is also dragging its feet but several countries in Europe, like Hungary and Denmarkare planning to buy it.

The same thing is going on with Crimea now. Businesses were withdrawn from Ukrainian owners and majority of them went down.Same happened in Ukraine in 2014, when Putin sneaked hundreds of trucks with armor into Donbass area, claiming it was “humanitarian help” for Russian separatists.

When Putin lied through media to the whole world that “Russian people were harrassed in Donbass and Lugantsk areas and wanted to separate” was just not true. I know it for sure since I’m from Donbass myself and we have always been historically mixed with Russians, never underestimating noone. However this lies served as a reason for Putin to start war and annex these 2 regions to Russia, leaving territories abandoned and people killed or jobless.The corruption is enormous in Russia.

I literally cannot think of a single Russian leader that was known for beingRussia remains one of the slowest growing economies in the world. And given its low GDP per capita base, it’s rather inexcusable for it to be growing so slowly. In 2020, China overtook Russia in nominal GDP per capita terms (though Russia is still ahead in PPP terms).Underlying this slow growth is the declining population. But it’s mostly a matter of the elderly dying early rather than not enough babies being born. The average life expectancy for Russian men is 63. That’s below the retirement age of 65. Declining birth rates are a problem as well. There’s even a national holiday in Russia set aside for having sex with your wife to have babies. No data on how this day off is actually used…But demographics aren’t the only thing weighing on the Russian economy. Sanctions play a big role, as does the lack of foreign investment. It’s just a bad picture all round.Moscow has grown enormously in the past 2 decades, but it is the only city in Russia that’s really doing well. It’s rapid development is largely at the expense of other parts of the country, especially in terms of skilled labor.In Putin’s 20 years in power, he’s overseen mediocre economic growth in absolute terms, but pitiful growth in relative terms.

If you update, you are installing a computer virus.Why are they on big-name, reputable sites?Let me lift the curtain and let you in on an ugly secret about how the Web works: The owners of big-name reputable sites (I think you mean “update your flash player.”Adobe Flash is now officially dead. There are no more updates. Every single one of these messages you see is now 100% guaranteed to be fake. If you update, you are installing a computer virus.Why are they on big-name, reputable sites?Let me lift the curtain and let you in on an ugly secret about how the Web works: The owners of big-name reputable sites (by which I mean the Delta Airlines site, Forbes, the Wall Street Journal, and others) know a lot less about what’s on their sites than you think.These fake malware downloaded usually come from banner ads. Poisoned banner ads are very, very common, because the billionaire owners of big-name sites don’t want to spend the money to have the banner advertising sales handled in house and they sure as hell don’t want to pay a team of expensive computer security people.So here’s how it works:Say you’re the CEO of the Wall Street Journal. You want to have a Web site and you want to sell banner ads on your Web site.You could hire a team of salespeople to call everyone you can think of who might want to buy banner ads on the Wall Street Journal site. And you could hire a team of Web programmers to implement the banner ad code on your site. And you could hire a team of designers to design the ads and a few security experts to examine and vet them ads.Or…You could just buy your ads from a banner ad broker.The banner ad broker sells web banner ads. That’s it. That’s all they do.The banner ad broker says “all you have to do is tell us how much money you charge and put one line of our code on your web pages and we’ll do everything else.”You as CEO no longer need to hire teams of people! You’ve just saved the company $250,000 a year, so you can give yourself a million-dollar bonus, buy another Ferrari for your collection, and go golfing.But here’s the thing:Now a banner ad company run from some guy’s garage in Florida has access to put anything they want onto your site.You think that banner ad company hires security experts to vet all the banner ads? Ah HA ha ha ha ha ha ha!Now say I’m a Russian criminal wanting to spread computer viruses.I set up a fake flower delivery company with a fake Web site. (Not a hypothetical example. One high-profile case of malware spread from big-name sites was actually done using a fake flower delivery company.)I go to Super Cheapie Cheapie Fly By Night Banner Ad Broker Incorporated and say “hello, I’d like to run these banner ads for my flower delivery service on the Wall Street Journal site please.”The guy who runs Super Cheapie Cheapie Fly By Night Banner Ad Broker Incorporated from his garage looks at my banner ad. It’s a banner ad for a flower delivery web site. He shrugs, clicks a few buttons, and starts running my banner ad on The Wall Street Journal.Oh, but he didn’t look very closely at my ad. He’s a college kid running an ad broker from his garage. So he didn’t notice that my ad has booby trapped code. Starting Tuesday at midnight, it loads a malicious script from a server in Belarus that redirects to a “You must update Flash player!!!” site.And now all of a sudden, boom! The Wall Street Journal page is serving up computer viruses. All because they didn’t want to handle selling ads in house, so they subbed it out to some guy in a garage with a nice-looking business card and a firm handshake, and let that guy in his garage insert who knows what kind of code on the Wall Street Journal site without vetting it.This has happened a lot. Huge big-name sites, including The Wall Street Journal, have served up malware from poisoned web banner ads.The industry has tried to clean up its act, and big sites have started buying ...","220,162 followers",Franklin Veaux,960,47.3K,779.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-the-Avengers-warn-the-rest-of-the-earth-that-an-impending-war-is-coming
