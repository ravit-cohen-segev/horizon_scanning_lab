Did they not renew their Norton Antivirus subscription?  I switched to Bitdefender years ago and they've been amazing.  Maybe the aliens should give it a shot?The truth is, any aliens capable of crossing the gulf between the stars (either through massive generational ships, or generating some FTL like event: warp, wormholes, slipstream) would have super-computers so totally beyond anything we could imagine that they would utterly destroy us.  Their first tactic would largely be to engineer a virus that would wipe us out.  That would be easy enough.  Then destroy the major cities with a bombardment of a few thousand 5 megaton bombs, targeting all of our major cities and bases.Then sit back and wait. With a virus wiping out swathes of humanity and our cities, infrastructure and leadership annihilated, 90% of the planet would be dead in a year.  The rare humans who might be immune (doubt it) to the virus or those isolated may survive, but most of humanity is alive because of food and electricity infrastructure.  They'd be dead in a year.Then you colonize the planet like the Spanish and English colonized the Americas:  you kill the remaining herds as they bug you.  Ignore the rest. Without the ability to make industry (large gatherings of humans would be detected by the alien ships in space and targeted and destroyed), they'd be slowly (or quickly) depopulated and room would be made for the aliens.  Game over.In the next hundred years, we may develop super-advanced AI and nanotechnology.  If we had that, then THAT would be useful.  But we don't.  There would be no way to defend ourselves from an alien invasion. We'd perish.

I agree with Dan [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-Bradbury-22 ], that a super species that can cross the void should have no problem with anti-virus software, but whatever... we've already done it. It's done. It's canon now. We're moving forward.From there, I'm not really sure that we needed to focus on bringing down the shields. I would just break everything. Seriously, I would write a code that rewrites all other codes to be utter jibberish. Internally, break all the things. Why not open all the doors and make every single ship fly around in circles or chaotic orbits. Fire all weapons non-stop and in all directions. Make those tentacle things (remember the bio-mechanical suits?) go absolutely haywire. I think it would be funny to see a bunch of aliens literally tied in knots as they try to prevent their rapidly crumbling ships from leaking atmosphere.In that catastrophic event, literally every system and subsystem would be affected. At the very least, if the shields stay up the weapons are down. If the propulsion says good, the environmental controls go down.

The IR is really the last resort. They never call you back from IR duty unless the worst case scenario happens, like WWIII levels. They did for a while in the early parts of the war in Iraq, but the practice was so unpopular and seemingly unnecessary that it was ended. It still exists as a fall back, but not used. Now they strictly call on the Active Reserves. You stay in this condition for the remainder of your eight years after you first enlisted.For me, Active Duty lasted 4 years. After that, I looked at my time in, said that two tours was enough, and that now I wanted to be chilled out veteran, get lazy with my shave and PT and go to college to be a boring nobody again.At that point I entered the IR.

She did this in front of about 50 people.I explained again that I was not able to accept the item in return and directed her to customer service.At this point, she referred to me as a ""worthless fucker"" and threw the open package of underwear at me, striking me in the face.Without hesitation (I was 17 years old), I picked up the open bag from where it fell on my register after hitting me in the face, and threw it back at her, striking her in the chest. It dropped to the floor, with the contents strewn about. Without retrieving the bag she left the department. Shaken by the experience, I continued working. I was comforted by several people in the line as it was pretty clear I was upset by the incident.I was called to the HR department about an hour later and, with virtually zero discussion, immediately fired. I don't even think they asked me what had happened. Fired. Bye.The very next morning my phone rang and it was my department supervisor, who asked me to come in as HR wanted to speak with me.When I arrived at the HR office I was informed that following the report filed by the incensed lady with the used underwear, numerous witnesses to the incident also went to the HR office and told them what had happened in the line; presenting a true reflection of the ""confrontation.""Due to the overwhelming support from many witnesses to the event, who went out of their way to report the horrific behavior of the lady and her verbal and physical abuse, the HR administrator apologized to me for being too hasty in their decision making and failing to listen to my side of the story. He then offered me back my position.My response. ""After the way I have been treated, I wouldn't work another second for this company"" ""I Quit!""

8,"It is the same as every other expat but with caveats.From a very practical point of view, what you need to do is:The issue is, many digital nomads don’t have things like a tax number overseas, which is asked for as part of the source of wealth requirements.If you say you are living in Thailand or Malaysia,It is the same as every other expat but with caveats.From a very practical point of view, what you need to do is:The issue is, many digital nomads don’t have things like a tax number overseas, which is asked for as part of the source of wealth requirements.If you say you are living in Thailand or Malaysia, as an example they will ask for a tax identification number (TIN).Most nomads don’t have this, and therefore make the mistake of focusing on investing back in their home country.The issue is, this could be a mistake. Many tax authorities, including in Canada, Australia and beyond, are now cracking down on expats and nomads. They are demanding that expats “show intent” in some cases.In practice this means giving up ties to your home country, such as cancelling the gym membership and other ties to your country of origin. We don’t know about the future, but this is likely to get worse.After Covid-19, and with an aging population, governments need revenue. Those living overseas could become easy targets.Therefore, it is better to ensure you deal with a brokerage company who understands nomads, and makes sure everything is legally correct, and makes sense from a long-term investing point of view.Beyond that, just like for regular expats, it is important to have portability. You will most likely move around, so any investments need to move with you.So, just as you should avoid investing in your home country, it isn’t a good idea to focus on investing locally.Expat-focused portable accounts, typically held in a country which isn’t your current country of residency or citizenship, are usually much more convenient to move around as a nomad.Beyond that I would make sure you get guidance or advice where appropriate, as most people end up with sub-optimal returns like this:Many younger nomads have told me that they bought crypto high, and panic sold low, and have done the same with other assets.It is important to have a good risk-adjusted asset strategy, and not just focus completely on getting the highest possible return, otherwise hidden risks increase and you can end up losing.Take too little risk and you will lose for sure, due to inflation. Take too much and you might lose as well.There are sensible ways to reduce risks and ensure returns are likely to be good.Are you a digital nomad?

I was brought on as an “excel guru” by the regional director. He was really data driven, and I had some skill sets that provided him the analysis he was needing. He took a position in another region. Guy who replaced him had no need for an “excel guru.” Drive down to work (it was an almost hour commute to this place) to find my log in doesn’t work. Everyone else goes into the team meeting while I wait for the director to arrive. I knew what was going on, but I was charging by the hour until someone told me. Shitty part is it was 3 weeks until Christmas, I was 3 months into an 18 month contract. Took a couple of months but landed with another place. That was 9 years ago and I’m still happily employed at this place.moral of the story? I came into work twice to find out I no longer had a job.

My code didn’t work.I tried again. Still nothing.I was puzzled as to why I couldn’t clock in. I was still standing there when two cops arrived and asked to speak with me.Okay. I went to go speak with them.“Shannon, you need to understand that you no longer work here,” said one cop. “You can’t keep coming back.”“What in the deep southern fried fuck are you talking about?” I asked. “I’ve been on vacation for the past ten days; I wasn’t even in town. I was about five states away the entire time.”“Wait, you mean you haven’t been coming in everyday?” the other cop asked. “Because that’s not what we were told.”“We were told that you refused to accept your termination and was making threats,” said the first cop.I reached into my purse and showed them my ticket stub from my flight. It clearly showed the date and time of departure and return.Big Boss was present, presumably to deal with the “problem.” The cops went to speak to him. Then Big Boss came out to speak to me.“Shannon, I was not informed that you were on vacation,” said Big Boss. “I was told that you were terminated and refused to accept it and then came in everyday and made threats.”“No, I went on vacation,” I said. “I had no idea anyone had an issue with me. With the hours I work and the schedule I keep, I rarely if ever interact with management.”Big Boss asked me to wait while he went back into the office. Ten minutes later Supervisor stormed out, red-faced and angry. Ten minutes after that, Manager stormed out, also red-faced and angry.Big Boss informed me that I’d been terminated for insubordination for refusing to report to work. Apparently Supervisor and Manager lied and told Big Boss I’d been terminated and refused to accept it and never mentioned that I was on vacation.Supervisor and Manager were suspended for a month without pay. Big Boss offered me a severance, which I took and moved on to the next job.Second time: during a meeting, the boss was going on about something and he said something that was incorrect, so I corrected him. That set him off. I explained that he was disseminating incorrect information and I was being informative.Boss had a meltdown. Meeting continued. Nothing eventful.A week later, I came to work and couldn’t clock in. Whatever.Went to the nurses station and went to log in. Didn’t work.Found out from HR that the boss terminated me two days after the meeting and said nothing to me about it. Didn’t say a word to anyone. I just left and found a new job and moved on.Third time: I’d gotten into it with a nurse supervisor because she was more concerned about being in charge and being in control than she was about using common sense and logic on the job. I stood my ground and refused to back down and she didn’t like that. She was furious when her boss pointed out to her that I was right and that she should have taken the time to think about the situation before flipping out on me.Went to work the next day and couldn’t clock in. At this job, I used my index finger to clock in and it didn’t work. Not unusual, until I got to my unit and tried to log in. Nurse Supervisor spotted me and yelled at me to get the hell off her unit. I refused because I was scheduled to work on that unit and two, it was my regular assignment.That raggedy bitch terminated me and then kept badgering me to come to work…and she never said a word. For five days, until HR called me into the office and informed me that I’d been terminated nearly a week ago.I pulled out my phone and showed HR the texts and played the messages I got from the supervisor screaming at me to come in…well after she, the supervisor, terminated me.HR rep went silent.I walked out.","2,881 followers",Shannon Nealey,1.4K,702,14.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-would-Dan-Holliday-Tim-Hibbetts-and-Jon-Davis-save-the-world-from-an-Independence-Day-like-threat

So my boss “offered” and I agreed to termination, which included a generous severance and forgiveness of relocation assistance I had received.It was almost too good to be true considering I got a signing bonus at the new job too.The funny thing is in the previous few months I had solved two major problems for that company, in the second case avoiding an expensive lawsuit they would have lost.

It was a pretty good place to work, and a good place for kids. We were divided into “classrooms” which were nice, spacious rooms with plenty of play centers and other toys. I was a “teacher” in the two and three year old kids’ room.I liked my job. I loved the kids. And they loved me back. I had no intentions of leaving that position any time soon.Then one morning, I walked in to work to find some employees clustered around the time clock. I wondered what the heck was going on. Made my way to the clock and saw the scribbled note taped to it.“As of today, we are closed.” No explanation. Some of the ladies saw the note and just left. Not this old gal. I wasn’t sure what had happened, but I wasn’t going to just leave. I wanted to hear it from the horse’s mouth. So I hung around with a few other like-minded people.Apparently, the owner of the business had not notified anyone that she was closing. Parents showed up with their children as usual, but they had to make other arrangements for their kids that day. It was really the pits for those parents who worked, because suddenly they found themselves without childcare.The owner finally showed up after a few hours, and we met her at the door. It was true, she said, she was closing the business. We were all blindsided. To add insult to injury, those who had seen the note and left were considered to have quit their jobs, while those of us who had stayed were considered fired. When you are fired because the business closed, you can collect unemployment. That was what was on my mind when I stayed after seeing the note on the time clock.So I suddenly found myself without a job. And I needed to work. So I went down to the unemployment office and registered, and then I took myself over to DHS, as it was called back then, and applied for food stamps to help get me through this rough patch.I started receiving benefits…food stamps and unemployment, but I continued to actively search for a job.Then one day, my point of contact, my caseworker for food stamps, called me and told me of a job opening. It was a contract job, with the state. I wouldn’t be a state employee, but contracted to them. It paid about 12 bucks an hour. I said, “Tell me more.”I ended up getting hired for that position. I terminated all my benefits and happily went back to work. I worked closely with the case managers at DHS, and my job was to “investigate” new benefits recipients, because fraud was rampant at that office, at that time. So I made home visits to people all day long. Turned out to be one of the most interesting jobs I’ve ever had. I even got a call from the big wigs in Austin to congratulate me on gathering information about a family who was running a scam operation buying and selling food stamps. He said I had saved the state hundreds of thousands of dollars by busting those people. I was pretty satisfied with that job. I stayed until the contract ran out.So things worked out just fine in the end. But the day I walked into that daycare and saw the sign saying they were closed, I was not a happy camper. I guess it’s true that good things come to those who wait.","4,265 followers",Marcy Stehling,871,1.6K,17.7M,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-walked-into-work-only-to-realize-that-you-were-fired

And I just said can I ask why. She said “i’m not sure but you can call her to see.” Turns out the boss’s voicemail box was full and she was on vacation. I’d called trying to get ahold of her and then called the main office number seeing who else I could speak to about it. I kept getting voicemails and “I don’t knows.” At this point it had been 3 days and I only had enough in the bank to survive another month, month and a half. So I started applying for jobs. I’d never filed unemployment before but I was semi-new to having my own apartment (second year living on my own). I was worried so I visited a local unemployment office and filled out documents to receive a small amount of income before I got my new job. About a week later I got a very angry call by an unemployment agent asking me to clarify what happened. I explained I was told i’m terminated by my supervisor and to leave. And he’s like what else did she say. I said she said to contact Theresa (? I think). He said did you call her. I’m like i tried and tried but her voicemail was full and others i called didn’t have answers for me. He’s like “ughhhh.” He’s like “they told me you just stopped showing up.” I’m like ??? wow. Then he wraps up the call. A few more days pass by and i’m accepted for a new job so a weight is lifted from my shoulders. Then a week later i receive an angry letter from unemployment office (presumably from the same guy who called me) saying “you will not be receiving unemployment aid. You QUIT your job.” And blah blah lots that i don’t remember. I’m like man, if your superior says that you’re terminated and tells you to leave, there’s only one thing that that means. Fired. I didn’t lie and I didn’t try to cheat the system.Then months later I find out what really happened. I receive a letter that says something about a case of suspected of abuse toward a patient. It said the result of the case is unfounded/inconclusive/negative or something like that. So what happened is a patient complained to someone that i was too rough on them. So they had to suspend me from work because of their protocol. They didn’t explain anything about that to me though. I didn’t know I was suspected of anything. In the end i wasn’t guilty of what the patient suspected me of. And I was already several months into a new job. Anyway I got manipulated and lied to.Growing up, all i ever heard about unemployment was “it’s what people used to cheat the system so they can sit on the couch and smoke pot.” That’s what my parents said. They’re very right-wing views in politics. They made it sound like the government just hands out unemployment pay so easily. From my experience, it’s not like that at all. I legitimately lost my job (was terminated) and was in financial need. And I was denied. I couldn’t help but think the angry unemployment agent had the same mindset as my parents, that he was talking to a spoiled millenial who didn’t want to have to work and wanted hand outs. That couldn’t be farther from the truth.",60 followers,Devin Doner,700,322,448.5K,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-walked-into-work-only-to-realize-that-you-were-fired

What were my qualifications? Non-existent, that’s what they were, but it actually worked out really well in the end. Not so much in the beginning, though.Before the holidays one foreman had walked into my office to explain that this one carpenter was apparently not an actual carpenter. He wasn’t completely incompetent, but since he had to be walked through each task step by step, he was mainly just distracting everyone else. I knew enough to know what I didn’t know, so I asked the foreman what he suggested we do about John. His unequivocal response was that he had to go, so I said okay, that was a plan. I assumed the foreman would fire him, so all I did was take him off the schedule and payroll. They’d finished the job he’d been on, so when everyone went back to work after the holiday he showed up at the office like the guys would normally do if they hadn’t been assigned a job. His old foreman was already on another job, so John must have just stood there as the other gathered up their guys and headed out.I feel terrible, because he must have felt like the last guy getting picked for a team, only the teams got on the field and started playing without him. When he finally walked in the office where I was trying to figure out why’d I’d received a $25,000 check from a supplier I’d just paid (I’d paid the wrong supplier), I thought he was there to complain about his check. People often did, because in the transition some timesheets ended up in the wrong place. That wasn’t what John wanted though, he just wanted to know what job he was meant to go to. I don’t know why, but my first thought was that he was an idiot who’d forgotten that he’d been fired, so I wasn’t gentle when I reminded him. He of course looked very confused, and that was when I finally realized that perhaps I was the person who was meant to fire him?I did, and I apologized profusely and wrote him a check for two weeks work, because it was my fault that he hadn’t known to look for work or save his paycheck. That was also when I learned that firing someone involves more than just saying the words, but I got it figured out eventually. It was absolutely grossly unfair to John, but he doesn’t hold a grudge. Apparently he wasn’t fond of construction anyway, so he now works as a cook for a local restaurant. He is very friendly whenever I come in, but after a decade he still thinks it’s funny to joke about the bungled firing. Last time I ate at his restaurant he came out to say hi, and when he went back to the kitchen he said he’d go get started on our order – as long as he didn’t learn that he was fired when he got back there!",204 followers,Brent Leonard Wolters,1.1K,134,1.7M,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-walked-into-work-only-to-realize-that-you-were-fired

We had an amazing vacation for 7 days. We came back feeling refreshed and rejuvenated; we were even thinking of staying longer. We arrived home on a Saturday night during a snowstorm and he and I were back at work on Monday morning.Monday happened to be April the 1st. I remember sitting at my desk handling all of the work I missed during our time away and my phone rings. It’s my SO, and at first, he was quiet and in disbelief but he lets it out, “Uhhh I was just let go…..immediately”. It was April Fool’s so my automatic reaction is, “you’re joking right?”. He was far from joking. They pulled him from his office as soon as he settled in, took him into the boardroom where the new owner’s and the previous President (they kept the old owner there as acting President just for face), and told him in a nutshell that his time with that company was up.He had worked there tirelessly for over 16 years. From what they said to him it was nothing to do with his work, but that they will have his ‘job’ handled by their creative team in their California office. Basically they fired him to save money and push the work onto some poor souls working for much less than what he was making. They were just trying to save a few dollars.As the months went by, the company has been getting very poor reviews by very disgruntled ex-employees.I honestly don’t know what’s worse, (1) the fact that they let him go right after our vacation (we spent a lot of money, had we known what we found out we never would have gone as crazy as we did….all in the name of having a romantic getaway). (2) The fact that they did it on April Fool’s Day or (3) that the old owner who he had worked alongside for so many years says to my SO that it wasn’t his decision to let him go and that he wanted to wait until we came back from vacation to tell him as to not stress us out; guilty conscience much? Yes, because coming back from an expensive vacation to find out we needed a lot of that money to get through the next few months isn’t stressful.Today, my SO is pursuing his dream career (being his own boss and owning his own company) so maybe in hindsight, it was a blessing, but the months following until his severance came into play were beyond difficult and straining.

Now, let go is being fired in terms of education. They dont like using fired at least in my county so if you are let go, you are fired. However, it is cheaper keeping a fired teacher until the end of the year versus hiring subs. It is a special type of hell to be in this predicament.Well first year, the superintendent who hired me moved and was replaced with let's call her bossbabe. Bossbabe hated me. She didnt like my voice. Said I needed to go to speech lessons. I worked with special need kids. She also made comments on my hair which was natural color.So after three months of her and her chosen leader who was supposed to help me become a better teacher but instead just broke me, I get my pink slip in February.Knowing you arent coming back but still needing to work for another three months and a week was hard. I told my mom if I were smart, I should have left that day. For the next three months, she tried to make me fill out a resignation notice because it will hurt my chance of being hired next year if I stay with being let go which is what teachers call being fired.I stayed. My aides and my students were wonderful. I still miss them. I still have great memories and I still tried to be a good teacher to my students.However, mentally I was a wreck. The witch was making life hell. I got depressed. I cried outside of work, hell she made me cry during class. I started having issues with sleeping and applying for new teaching jobs while teaching and going to night school was hell.I finished. I applied for unemployment. I got it. I called it my revenge. However I got a new intern job in August. The principal didn't want me but he was desperate but I knew in the interview, he didn't like me and i should keep looking. I was right. I admit I was new but I was doomed with the new school with two week November vacation followed by a car accident in February that kept me home for two weeks.He made it clear a week before my trip, if I go on the vacation, I may not be there next year. But I think I already knew I no longer wanted to be a teacher. plus, I spent 2,000 on it and even told him about my vacation before he hired me and made sure it was ok. I should have documented him saying yes.I was tired of being expected to stay until 6pm or 7pm on weekdays to prove to other teachers that I am a teacher. I was tired of watching troubled but normal students being pushed into special ed because other teachers dont want to deal with them. I was tired of other teachers treating my students as freaks, I was tired of the school politics, I was tired of the lack of discipline in schools. In CA, a kid can tell they will rape you and you cant remove them anymore from class because its discrimination.I choose my vacation. I finished up my year and just did my job. I got my pink slip the minute I got back from my car accident. Again, they tried to make me do a resignation letter so I dont have a let go (fire) on my record. I knew I was done trying so i denied.After my last check and cleaning my shared classroom with the resource teacher, I went to a bar for my first drink in a year and then applied for unemployment. I also dyed my hair pink. Something I always wanted to do but couldnt because of trying to be professional.I got my unemployment. I looked for jobs but i had to admit I struggled to find a job. My confidence was low, I wasted two years on a teaching program I never finished. You need to be employed at a school to be in the program. My degree gave little choices at this time. It was challenging.Worse, I gave up a job I loved to become a teacher. I finally got a idea to reapply at my old job. They took me back. I'm still there. Im making ok money. Not as much as I made as a teacher but this job is more suited for me. Plus, I'm liked at my work and respected despite my speech disability and my medical conditions.I learned a lesson. A leap of faith may be a wonderful adventure or your worst decision. I wasnt made to be a teacher. I pity teachers. I'm so glad I'm free from the hell that is teaching. Im glad I was fired.By the way they wanted me to sign the resignation letter because if you resign you cant get unemployment. They also want you to sign it to prove you wont be trouble.",6 followers,Ian Williams,6.5K,2.7K,36.8M,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-walked-into-work-only-to-realize-that-you-were-fired

But this was a Monday or Tuesday, so it seemed strange that the entire office would be empty. Plus, the call desk folks weren’t there either…there was always someone on the phone supporting customers. I walked to the cafeteria, no one. Meeting rooms, no one. A straggler or two in an office behind a closed door.I was standing in the middle of the hallway, looking around trying to figure out what was going on when my manager’s manager (COO or CIO might have been his title) walked up and asked who I was and why I was there. This guy was new to the company, and I’d had a 1-on-1 sit down with him about 5 weeks prior (guess it left quite the impression). I again introduced myself and explained my part-time intern role, when he interrupts, “stay here”. Comes back 10 minutes later and says, “you can stay”, and implied that I could choose to sit anywhere I wanted. Guessing he’d made a couple of calls and/or looked up my employment record and saw the company paid me $12 per hour.Eventually a co-worker I knew strolled into the office. He gave me the low down that it was now just he and I in the “engineering team”. I was graduating in a couple of weeks, so I worked a few more days before giving notice. Had strongly been considering to accept a full-time position with this company after graduation. And was very close to declining another offer, since it required moving across country. Fortunately for me, the mass purge happened before I’d made any decisions.Still viscerally remember that strange feeling of wondering where did everyone go, as I stood in that empty office. Always wondered how many of my co-workers landed on their feet…and how traumatic that mass-exodus might have been for some. Work and company are such a strange concepts in some ways, especially in the way that being let go can really f’ck with your head. Being ostracized from the group, or having the whole group get killed off, is something that can really send people for a loop…",0 followers,Elijah Williamson,7.7K,145,5.9M,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-walked-into-work-only-to-realize-that-you-were-fired

My “boss” Sherry at the department there called me into her office when I got in. She told me that I was going to be let go BUT I would have to stay on the job working so I could train my replacement after the staffing department could find a replacement. I didn’t want to work for Sherry anymore but walking out meant I would be leaving the temp staff too.We had 2 or 3 candidates who were either unable to learn the job or realized that the “boss” was a bit demanding and they were scared away by the atmosphere. Finally we got another candidate and I trained him (Ron) for 3 days. Then I was asked to take an assignment in another department and they asked Sherry if I could not work the last day so I could train for the other position. She said no problem and I went on to that job.I had been at the new department for a week when my “replacement” called me with a question. He had sent me many emails asking for help as well as several other conversations on the phone. After I answered his questions, Sherry” asked to speak to me. She wanted to know how many calls and emails I had gotten from Ron that week. After I answered her, she told me Ron had been trying to find other ways to do his tasks there. And because of that he wasn’t getting his work done. Ron thought he could find a better way to do things but he spent hours trying to figure out the new way for a task would have taken me 20 minutes or less. So the “boss” asked me,if I would return to work for her that following Monday “full-time” to train Ron for an additional two weeks. I told her I would have to check and I’d get back to her.The temp service said they could replace me at my current assignment. I had just had an interview for a permanent job at the university so I was going to start it in two weeks so that was all I could give to Sherry. I also called my mom and asked her opinion. Mom said I should tell no and gave some expletives that I should use along with that. I told Mom I couldn’t leave Sherry in a lurch. A guilty conscience would have made me feel so bad that I couldn’t.So I went back for two weeks. Sherry even offered me a higher salary than my upcoming permanent job if I would stay full-time with her. I told her no. She asked me why and I told her that my new office would have a door, a window and was bigger than her office.I did ask Sherry one more question. The day I was late was due to a financial issue with my bank account. I had to borrow money from a friend so my rent check didn’t bounce at the bank. I had told her the truth about why I was going to be late but only the “financial issue” without the specifics. So I asked Sherry, “If I had called-in with a daughter with a temperature and I had to stay home with her, would you have fired me.” Sherry replied, “No. I should have not terminated your assignment here. Can you forgive me for that?”I told her I could forgive her but also told her “My mom said that I should have said I wouldn’t come back to help.” Then I added a shortened version of mom’s less elegant comment using her expletives and that I couldn’t do that.” And I told Sherry I had felt obligated to return.Started my new job then (2001) and still working at the University. For the same department even, just more responsibilities. Great people to work with.

I was very closed to my colleagues and was really sad for not be able to say proper goodbye 😭😭😭. Big corporations usually wait until everyone left and when you’re in the meeting to lock your computer.😢After that painful experience, I find corporate job can be very cold blood, and they often have someone escorted you out the building the minute you’re let go. You probably have 10–15 mins to wrap up your belonging but that’s about it. The guy who escorted me out helped carry my box and felt bad for me - wish we didn’t have to meet this way.Here’s my long story:I worked for the company through a 3rd party staffing agency for 2 years before, and everyone in the AR department likes me and my performance. My previous coworker and I caught up 4 years of work within 3–6 months. 😲 Imagine being in a big storage room with mountain of paper stacks, from the floor to almost touched the ceiling, and somehow we processed all of that💪💪.The staffing agency took over 50% of my salary. When the company I worked for found out how I was working for such little pay, they raised my salary 4 times. Still, the hiring agency took 50–75% of the raises.Anyway, a year after I left that AR assignment, I finally got in again - This time, as an official employee working for AP department (same company). I was only working there for less than 6 months before I was let go. Up until this day, I wasn’t sure why I was let go but I had my suspicions:1/ I hurt my wrist at work and was using worker comp for only few times (like 3-5 doctors visit). Honestly though, I learnt to never take worker comp, especially if you’re new to the job. The company will often just wait for you to finish with your worker comp claim, then kick you out.I never really want to file for worker comp in the first place, if not for the company nurse. I rather use my own health insurance and not to burden the company.Turned out, at least 3–5 ladies at work experienced the same wrist pain as I had, due to the nature of our job and my not so ergonomic position setup. All of them were smart and did not seek treatments through worker comp.2/ The supervisor probably disliked me or something. The only incident I could think of is - she was giving me instructions one day, and I made sure to ask her at least 3 times out loud to confirm (in front of my coworkers), that “you want me to send this message say A, B, C to this X person?”Having common sense, I didn’t think it was a good idea to send that email she wanted, but she insisted. Anyway, the X person received that message passed it to his supervisor Y, and eventually it went up to the office chain all the way to the Director of the company.I always cc my supervisor and my team in the email so they’re aware of everything going on. The supervisor could have taken action, if she saw the email thread was going the wrong way. Obviously though, she thought her instructions were right until the very end.Well, it didn’t matter because the Big Boss stepped in and told her off. Then she tried to push all the blames on me, for being a new employee and didn’t know what I was doing.Well, I couldn’t really defend myself since only my coworkers knew what’s really going on, but who’s gonna step up and risk losing their jobs? Anyway, I just took the blame for her, but I honestly don’t think the company let me go because of that 1 single incident though. Maybe I was naive.For some reasons, I’ve found my supervisor was always grumpy and weird. One time, our department was passing a Christmas card around, which everyone wrote thank you notes to the cleaning lady (who has always been very kind & sweet). People can also put in some tips ($1, $5 or up to $20) in the envelope for the janitor as thank you gifts (although it’s not mandatory).Anyway, I passed the card to my supervisor and explained to her what the office was doing. She then glared at me (a look that’s hard to forget) and said “I don’t celebrate Christmas, take it back.”Honestly, I was stunned so I probably looked awkward for a brief moment. I understand we have to be mindful of other people’s religions, so we always try to say “happy holiday or thank you” note - instead of using the “Christmas” word.That company was actually was very cool and love their holiday spirits. They would decorate the entire building (in & out), and have pot luck party daily for a month between Thanksgiving to New Year. We actually put our names down on the “holiday calendar,” so we we know who will bring which dishes for lunch gathering that day. It was the best time of the year and we all gained like 10 lbs. 😆🤣Anyway, I personally found my supervisor’s response was kinda rude, and that told me a lot about a person. That’s the same lady who told us new employees on the first week that “your job is to make sure I would always look good in front of my boss and other higher management.” 😅—————————In the end, I still love my previous corporation job, because I got to meet many cool and kind people who worked there. Some of them has become my life long friends. 🥺I was always thinking how it was such a blessing to be able to work for them. It’s one of the few places I thought I would work there till I retired. Many employees there often worked 20–40 yrs for the company.Anyway, call me weak if you want, but I was traumatized from that experience (even though I told people I was okay). I actually found a nice park to stop by on my way home, and cried in my car that day.I didn’t want to let my family know I lost my job, since they were so happy that I got in this company. I even cheered up my previous manager in AR department when she learnt I was let go & called me. She was upset for me. At least there’s someone out there appreciated my work.Now I only work for smaller businesses and I’m an expert at my job. I know there’s more opportunities in corporations, but I was afraid the same thing will happen again.

In speaking with my now-former supervisor, I encouraged him to change the passwords again; several people had been laid off, and it’s a stupid idea to use them in the first place. I later got a letter from their lawyer, asking me if I had intended to threaten them. Of course, I hadn’t, and told them as much (after speaking to a lawyer friend).

Some were templates, and some were just blank that employees just sent out whatever was on their minds. It was extremely inconsistent and didn’t present a united front to the customer.

One of the biggest issues that I’ve noticed in my classmates and students that struggle with math is this: They view math as memorizing a bunch of formulas and applying them. This is often how they were taught, and it’s horrible! To show the difference, let me give an example of the two ways that a simple concept can be taught:Way 1:The teacher states area formulas for the following: equilateral triangles, squares, rectangles, right triangles, regular hexagons. These are all pretty basic shapes, but their area formulas are decently different at first glance.Way 2:The teacher shows visually why a rectangle’s area is equal to its width times its height, by showing a diagram like thisThe students can clearly see that there are 15 squares, which is the area. By doing a couple more examples, students will realize that the area can be found by multiplying the side lengths.From here, the teacher can have students come up with the formula for a square based on the rectangle area formula, since squares are just special rectangles.At this point, the students are also capable of finding the area formula for right triangles; by noticing that two of the same right triangle put together make a rectangle. Thus the area of the triangle is one half the area of the rectangle. That is, Area(right triangle)=(1/2)base*height.Next, let’s memorize one formula (the teacher could go more into depth explaining how to obtain this, but for now it may be easier to memorize).The area of an equilateral triangle (a triangle with all side lengths the same) isFrom here, the students can construct the area formula for regular hexagons (a 6 sided shape with every side the same length and angle the same), as a regular hexagon with side lengthThus the area of the regular hexagon is six times the area of each equilateral triangle, i.e.The difference between these lessons is that, in the first lesson, students are given 5 seemingly different equations to memorize. If they forget one of the equations, they will have NO way of doing related problems! This can be extremely frustrating, especially for younger students. Students who are taught like this get bored with math because there doesn’t seem to be any point to what they’re learning- each fact seems isolated and uninteresting.Students who learn from lessons like the second one, however, are learning to THINK not memorize. Students in the second lesson only have to memorize one formula! Any of the other formulas, they can recreate themselves during a test or on homework. They will also be able to come up with formulas for other shapes, such as octagons or parallelograms. Students in lessons like these will build connections between the seemingly different branches of math and learn to see some of the cool intricacies within math.Of course, it also helps if teachers connect math to the real world; simply learning the area formulas for different shapes may seem pointless to some students. But if the teacher explains how this could be used, it might stick in a kid’s head better! For example, students could consider what the perimeter (side lengths) of different shapes were with the same area (ie, if a square and a circle have the same area, what are the perimeters of each?). The teacher could then explain how this comes up in nature sometimes; for example, bubbles take on a sphere shape because it minimizes the surface area (analogous to perimeter) per volume (analogous to area). The teacher could bring in bubbles and a variety of tools (like hangers folded into different shapes) to show that, no matter what shape the bubble wand is, the bubbles always snap back into a sphere. This relates to what they’re learning in class because they’ll see that circles (the 2d versions of spheres) also minimize perimeters.Edit: In response to some of the comments, I wanted to point out that this method of teaching can work for non-visual problems as well. The point isn't to show pictures (though visualizing math is great!), but rather to explain the process used to obtain the formulas. This is something that can be done even for very algebraic problems!Edit 2: Thanks to whoever suggested the edits for the formulas! I didn’t know that Quora had a way to write formulas nicely. This looks so much better!Edit 3: Wow, 1.5K upvotes! Would never have expected my answer to reach such a wide audience!
