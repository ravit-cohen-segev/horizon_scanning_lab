How to make electricity with reactors is well known, so I'll concentrate on propulsion.Short answer:Long answer:Space travel needs power for propulsion and for operations.  Nuclear fission can provide both.  How to make electricity with reactors is well known, so I'll concentrate on propulsion.Short answer:Long answer:The rocket equation tells usWhat exhaust velocity is fission capable of?  The nuclear-thermal rockets mentioned above all use heat from a reactor to accelerate a gas propellant.  Naturally, the heavier the propellant, the slower it will exit the rocket when heated by a given amount.  Hence, lightweight hydrogen gas is often chosen.But the revolutionary dusty plasma reactor of Sheldon & ClarkThoriumTo burn thorium directly we need to use fast neutrons.  It should be possible to run a nuclear-thermal rocket on fast neutrons (though we might need to swap the hydrogen propellant for helium, since the former gas is a neutron moderator).  The dusty plasma reactor is generally assumed to run on slow neutrons, since then the plasma can be made much smaller.  To burn thorium with slow neutrons we first need to transmute (""breed"") it into uranium-233.  While breeding nuclear fuel in flight would certainly complicate engine design, it may turn out to be feasible.It is certainly the case that, if weAside: What about Fusion?The only fusion reaction that releases charged products more energetically than fission is D-He3 (about 13% light speed).  He3 doesn't occur on Earth, so it would have to be bred in flight.  And the D-He3 reaction is very hard to achieve.So fusion has some promise, but unlike fission-powered rockets, we don't yet have the technology to make it work.* Assuming 100% engine efficiency, a one-way fission-powered trip on the ISS to Proxima Centauri would take ~ 40 years and require 25kt U-235.  That is a majority of the 39kt currently recoverable worldwide: http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf75.html","2,201 followers",Iain McClatchie,668,411,2.8M,https://www.quora.com/Could-thorium-reactors-be-used-for-space-travel
1,"He-3 fusion does have some advantages.Fusion reactions produce easier to shield radiation than the penetrating gamma radiation produced by most forms of nuclear fission. The more common neutron fusion reactions like Deuterium-Tritium (DT) or Deuterium-Deuterium (DD) produce energetic neutrons that while dangerous, can be blocked by relatively light and relatively inexpensive materials like Borated High Density PolyethylenHe-3 fusion does have some advantages.Fusion reactions produce easier to shield radiation than the penetrating gamma radiation produced by most forms of nuclear fission. The more common neutron fusion reactions like Deuterium-Tritium (DT) or Deuterium-Deuterium (DD) produce energetic neutrons that while dangerous, can be blocked by relatively light and relatively inexpensive materials like Borated High Density Polyethylene Plastic, which can be conveniently cast into custom shapes as needed to safely shield a neutron producing fusion reactor.There are also aneutronic fusion reactions that occur at higher temperatures and plasma pressures like p-B11 and D-He3 that produce charged particles like protons or alpha particles instead of neutrons. Charged particles like protons can be efficiently collected on screens and plates and used to directly produce electricity by magneto-hydrodynamic energy converters at very high efficiencies and with no moving parts to wear out. At least one current fusion experiment, Dense Plasma Focus fusion at LPP Fusion , has achieved the high temperatures and confinement times needed to produce aneutronic fusion (LPP Fusion is currently working on improving plasma pressure - the last condition it needs to satisfy to achieve the requirements for aneutronic fusion). Fission ignited Fusion also can reach the fusion triple-product needed to produce aneutronic fusion (but no fusion experiments with aneutronic fuels were ever conducted by Test program to my knowledge).Even if you achieve the extreme simultaneous requirements for D-He3 or He3-He3 fusion, fusion cross sections and fusion reaction rates for neutron producing fusion reactions like D-T and D-D fusion are much more attractive, by many orders of magnitude, than for the He3 reactions.A graph of fusion reaction cross section for different fusion reactions versus temperature (keV)-The D-He3 reaction has better fusion reaction rates at lower temperatures, but it is not totally aneutronic and still produces some fast 14.1 MeV neutrons that have to be shielded to provide operator safety.It may not be necessary to go to the moon to obtain secure supplies of He-3Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation (fusion powered ships, planes, trains, cars, and rockets to the stars).The fusion reaction that has the best fusion reaction rates at temperatures we know how to produce in machines we know how to build is the followingD + He3 -> He-4 + proton (18.3 MeV energy) (aneutronic)The reaction rates for D+He3 fusion is comparable to D-D fusion, and the D+He3 fusion reaction has the advantage of producing mostly charged protons that are easy to shield and easy to use to directly convert fusion energy into electrical energy at high efficiency.In the space advocacy community, it is not uncommon to encounter supporters of going to the moon to obtain He3 fuel. What is generally not mentioned is the fact that it may be possible to manufacture He3 more cheaply on earth by tuning D-D fusion reactors to produce both energy and He3 fuel as they operate while burning ubiquitous Deuterium fuel obtained from sea water.Terrestrially rare He3 can potentially be produced in stationary earth bound D-D fusion reactor that operates with the fusion side-chain suppressed that normally burns He3 in situ.The D-D fusion reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:D + D	→ T	+ 1HD + D	→ 3He	+ nBy properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVSince He3 reactions occur at higher temperatures and plasma pressures, it should be possible to configure a D-D fusion reactor to operate just below the conditions needed to burn He3 at high reaction rates and make such a D-D fusion reactor an He3 fuel manufacturing facility.Most fusion analysts only consider the D + He3 fusion reaction among He3 fuel burning fusion reactions because it has among the highest fusion reaction rates of aneutronic fusion reactions. It might be valuable, however, to mention another aneutronic He-3 fusion reaction that has several exceptional characteristics that may one day make it very important.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).What are some of the characteristics of He3-He3 fusion that makes it exceptional?Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Collecting He3 from D-D fusion reactors adjusted to suppress He3 fusion allows this He3 aneutronic fusion fuel to be produced significantly more cheaply than going into space for it.Inertial Confinement Fusion operates using by far the highest density fusion plasma and this is significant from the standpoint of building a small and economic power reactor. The power that can be drawn from a burning plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the square of the density of the fusion plasma. The denser the fusion plasma, the more energy that can be extracted from it.Inertial Confinement Fusion power plants that employ He3-He3 fusion could be small if desired (both in physical size and in power output). Teaming stationary D-D fusion reactors tuned to produce energy and He3 fuel with smaller mobile reactors burning He3 aneutronic fuel for fusion transportation applications would cover a large portion of mankind’s need for reliable and clean energy and could usher in an exciting new technical age and an end to worldwide energy scarcity and poverty that typically results from lack of access to energy.Sometime within the next decade we should see experimentally whether a tuned ICF D-D fusion reactor using abundant and cheap non-radioactive Deuterium separated from the world's oceans is capable of producing significant quantities of He-3 fuel which can be scavenged from the debris left in the evacuated ICF fusion chamber following a power producing fusion shot.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Could-thorium-reactors-be-used-for-space-travel

Each year, thousands of tourists – mostly scholars and researchers – visit the library from across the world.The library has over 9 LAKH books!The books cover a wide range of topics, but are mostly Hindi books and those pertain to ancient Indian texts and the epics. The library also has a wonderful collection of atlases, and dictionaries of several languages, and books on Indian history. Having begun collecting the books in 1998, the library now houses about 9 lakh books, and its number is growing even now.And it was made using funds initially allotted for a temple!One of the more remarkable features of the library is the fact that it was made from the funds for a temple for the Goddess. This is one of the best uses of money they could have made.The library currently only allows visitors and tourists to view the books, but soon intends to let those interested borrow certain books.Source-Edit- Thanks guys for reading my answer.

Because, they’re fighting for a Community which was suppressed for many centuries and even after 70 years of Independence if Dalits face this Discrimination and Atrocities, shouldn’t they raise their voices? Definitely, They Should!But there’s more to it than this.The Leader or Founder of thisNow during Dussehra 2018, his Army is demanding that the burning of Ravan’s effigy be banned in the festival and the violators be booked under SC/ST Act. This is exactly where aThese people think that Lord Rama killing Ravana is completely unfair and they don’t agree with the portrayal of Ram as Hero and Ravan as Villain. They think of the Ramayana as some Upper Caste Supremacy in which Kshatriya born Lord Ram killed Ravan who they claim asBut the fact is thatFor argument sake, let’s just assume that Ravan was a Dalit. Then why did Lord Ram make younger brother of Ravan, Vibhishana the King of Lanka? So, it’s all about Dharma V Adharma irrespective of Caste.Some people with half knowledge argue that Abduction of Sita Devi was just a reaction to what Lakshmana did to Shurpanakha. I don’t want to go much into this stuff but remember that Hinduism is much more complex than what it seems.For example, Rama who killed Vali had to die from an arrow of a hunter in his Krishna Avatar, after winning Mahabharata involving Millions.Similarly, There’s much more to Ravan’s story than just revenge for his sister.Also, there are people who think of this as North vs South India. I would like to remind such people that the commander-in-chief of this North Indian Dark Skinned Kshatriya was a South Indian.Finally, I would like to ask just one question to Dalit Brothers and Sisters :Are you Hindus? Yes you are! But do you consider yourselves Hindus?I would also like to ask one important question to so called Upper Castes :Do you consider Dalits as Hindus? Do you think of them as your brothers and sisters? Then stop these atrocities on your fellow Hindus. And for God’s sake, don’t do things like not allowing them to Temples. And don’t shed crocodile tears later, when you do such things and those families convert to some other Religions for all practical purposes.

Local authorities of Tawang approached him to include their area with Bomdila due to geographical proximity considering Bumla Pass.In the autumn of 1950, he was summoned by the then Assam governor, Jairamdas Daulatram, who gave him a secret file with orders to bring Tawang under the Indian control.He took 2 platoons of 5 Assam Rifles & trekked all the way to Tawang, approximately 175 kilometers.

I asked her whether her parents about her depression issue, she said she has kept them in shadow. Because even she says it they won't acknowledge it and on top blame her for it too.I know many people who broke with the person they loved because their parents didn't approve of them and led a sad life.The reason I gave NEET was also because of my parents. Because they decided it and I felt that I should make my parents happy by cracking that exam. Not me there were many people who have done the same.Even children try to make their parents happy, most of the decisions children take to appease their parents. Every child wants their parents to be proud of them irrespective of what weight the action makes them do.Always to portray children as evil, bad and rude, sounds so caricaturish. I think it's high time that people stop misusing the tag of “Elder” or “Parents.”Not all children are bad, not all children are cruel. Sometimes they may talk back or retaliate because your decisions may not be well for them, that doesn't mean they don't love or value you.Also demanding emotional, mental, or financial support isn't bad. Parents are the closest source for any child, if a person feels threatened it's obvious for them to call for help.The Gen Z shifting to online or others platforms for entertainment shows that Indian Television is not for all. Especially the way they directly portray people wrong due to old perspectives.A small proverb:“The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg.”Sometimes the decisions you feel that is good for us, can be contagious for us too. Not everyone is wired in the same way, the way in which you perceive the world.Stats of children committing suicide.That Parents can be wrong too. That Elders can be wrong too. There are abusive parents in just the same way as children.It's high to stop putting people on a pedestal just because of their age.“QUE SERA SERA.”","1,196 followers",Mayur Tasre,5.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

The experience was just amazing!!Edit 1:India is also the proud home of the earliest dockyard, which is truly the landmark of maritime history of the world. The earliest Dockyard is found at the site of Lothal in Gujrat. This dockyard as in the words of great archaeologist DR. SR RAO has features comparable to those of dockyards at Mumbai and Vishakapatnam. Also this dockyard could handle 60 ships and 30 tonnes of cargo which is remarkable.Another site is Dholavira of the Kutch region of Gujrat. This site is unique in several respects but I wish to highlight just one.So India again is the proud home of the world's earliest sign board. The oldest and the most ancient sign board comes from this site. It includes 10 symbols of the undeciphered Indus script. Each symbol is 37 cm(approx) in height and is made of gypsum. This important find was excavated near the northern gateway of Dholavira indicating that it was put up on the gateway so that everyone could read again indicating widespread literacy among the harappans.PS.

Your son, your daughter, your younger brother and sister..The place isKota (Rajasthan) .. they call it the education hub of India. But I Want all of you to know some facts about this place. Please be aware and create awareness.It's not uncommon if some student just starts to cry in in front of you .. such is a life in Kota.WhyJee syllabus _ 1sf year engineering and AIPMT _ 1st year MBBS ..So, hailing from schools that follow only NCERT .. we can't solve the paper on our own.EditI am not saying Kota is wrong, I just tried to show the truth. Again sorry I may not be 100% correct and I have not commented on selection rate of this city because I dont care if one looses creativity and interest in the core subjects and than anyhow get into IIT or Medical and loose all interest to study (not applies to all,forgive me for saying but to many of students it happens)We have NTSE scholars in last batch in Kota because they are already exhausted in solving those deadly questions and have lost the interest they used to previously have. Such a preparation should be avoided which detriotes your health and makes you a robo ! Thats what my point is. (I was myself NTSE scholar, so I know it better than you)Edit2I didn't write this answer to defame this place as mentioned in comments section but tried to bring up the truth with a hope that awareness by people will force coachings to care about students and make some necessary changes.And many voices remained unheard, when the ambitions became heavy on life itself, when a bad score created lack of confidence for whole life, when the sun didn't shine the next day in somebody's life, when the smiles were lost in filling those OMRs, when childhood became the worst time for somebody,when we lost so many great writers, thinkers, scientists, inventors in this rat race, who grow up to become 9 to 5 workers, unsatisfied.When the hunger for knowledge turned into lust for marks, when for some parents their kids became source of fulfilling their own dreams.When India lost Indians..For us depression is just a word & suicide is just a number.Someone mentioned in comments that suicides happen in IITs too but why stress snuffs life ? Why education has to be a burden and not a source of happiness ?What is wrong if I have written about it ? For people to read, discuss and understand.I don't need your certificate to prove I am right, It took sometime to write this answer, It took some daring to go against system to show you all. And what I get for return ?? Nothing. So, why would I do it, if I am wrong or not concerned ?Guys, look at the video Rajesh Maheshwari’s shameful speech to their staff. He is the director of Allen Career Institute. And someone has leaked the video, it has gone viral.He says I am the don of coaching industry. Thsy have a Target to fulfil till 2025, and that is 5 lakh students must be enrolled in Classroom course. He has not said about how to teach or how to handle children. The speech is extremely shameful. I have not written about it but please see that.We are a clowns of circus, these people use us, spit on us and than we don’t say anything. Look at the comment section. It is filled with comments that say change yourself why to change the system. That say its not only Kota and finally trying to prove that all students who have undergone through this phase were weak. Again only one thing for us suicide is just a number, 25 students commit suicide due to study pressure in Kota. We read ignore. They say we were pressure free and trying to disapprove all facts I have written.. We promote their behavoir, there is a thin line been struggle, hardwork and slavery that forces you to beleive your master is your god and whatever he do is correct for you.There is a difference between preparing for an exam or being raised for slaughter. There is a difference between learning or being tortured. There is a difference between life and death. We are humans, we are not the pets. We have thinking capacity and look at this coaching system. What is good in that, tell me a single positive point you can see there.And yes watching so many students break here in this mecca of education, only thought coming to my mind is what these kids might have done if there were no pressure of performance and these high expectations.How can they expect 16–17 year old kids to perform the best, to remain stress free when they shift them to lower batches, the peer pressure immensely increases, in their hostels they feel afraid to face people because only thing asked is what's your batch ? Your rank ? And being walked over if they aren't performing.Edit:So, my dear countrymen. Why you feel shocked when a bridge falls because of a corrupt engineer, when poor people loose their kidneys because of these so called best doctors, hospital scams are so common, why IAS officer asked for dowry in my city, why police is not working?And than only thought coming to our angry minds is where is their humanity ? Sorry to say, but it is destroyed in the road to position, power and money. They are slaves of their lust, dont expect much from them, because that’s what our system teaches them. Very few gentleman are left, and because of them there is safety.The students who felt it was wrong have already left the race, these humans with complete passion have given up and currently facing socital pressure for doing so.before making them engineer and doctor, make them a human, I request you parents and money making minds.Guys, and one more thing. There is a claim by coachings of Kota that it’s the average and below average students who take such steps. But one thing I want to make clear that, in every phase there are around 1600 students, out of which coaching system puts 1400 in “average category”. Dont become a victim of this claim. And it proves that they dont care about lives of average students. Not each life is precious maybe.and my dear, if you are a student going through shit in life, in any such building, I assure you that you will be strong when you come out of here, and dont worry about it. You are not alone, not at all ! See, there are many people going through all this. And if you think you are average, everyone else is in something or other is average.Don’t blame yourself all the time, don’t live with regrets. Everything is waiting for you, there is a whole new life waiting for you buddy, please dont take any fatal step. You are the most precious person. You know what you are, but you dont know what you maybe.We cant judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.Your friends and relatives cant judge you, by your ability to solve a question in JEE and NEET.

He isIf we look at the history of the last 5000 years, Indians have for 4700 years been the cradle of technology, architecture, political science, warfare in some way or the other. But now, we have become humble and powerless due to our tolerance, and the Western world is benefitting through it at our cost.Regardless, Shiva has grown to become more popular now, so many may have identified him, with his stature grew as a politician and whatnot, the point remains that he was a prodigy who made the conventional office mail system into working code by himself at the age of 14. According to him, Tomlinson, who is attributed to this achievement had used white supremacy tactics to take the credit for inventing EMAIL, and he was unable to find the required support from the community due to his race at the time. However, now he is again fighting for himself and things have begun to straighten up.Indians are perceived to be humble, and our achievements are downplayed by the western world, this is nothing new. Our architectural marvels, made thousands of years ago are ignored, while Europian churches made after Renaissance, are considered historic. Our contributions are downplayed, and even mocked as pseudoscience when it’s being realized that Science as of now has been unable to explore even a tiny part of the universe we live in. And this has not stopped, our inventors, scientists, and even engineers and doctors are amongst the best, and at the same time, the lowest paid and are considered too simple for being an inspiration.As a nation, India need role models. And we don’t need white role models, at least after 300 years of oppression that they have inflicted over us, and the whole world of course. We know how Africa became so poor, we know who used all our resources, and we still end up idolizing them.I’m not asking to stop respecting Zuckerberg, or Jobs. I’m asking to acknowledge Shiva. EMAIL is as big an idea as Facebook, if not bigger, And a 14-year-old may not have entirely created it, but our nation surely has been a victim, and we continue to let ourselves stay that way by ignoring our intellectuals and thinkers.Note:He has also been in some controversies in recent times, and I don’t support all his ideas. I just wanted to throw light on his contributions, which were ignored for a lot of time. hope this won’t stay collapsed now.Reference:Ray Tomlinson's 'story' about inventing email is the biggest propaganda lie of modern tech history: Shiva AyyaduraiShiva Ayyadurai - Wikipedia",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,3.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

On one hand, you will see them becoming ambassadors of PETA and asking everyone to go vegan and on the other hand, they will be feasting on steak for dinner. Just like how Alia Bhatt is wearing a dress that says “Speak up for Animals"". Quite a noble initiative, right? Well, not when you are holding a leather bag yourself! Practice before you preach, madam!Plus, this kind of movement sees the light of the day when Hindu festivals are around the corner. When Durga Puja was approaching, certain groups in West Bengal started a vegan campaign while during this time, people rejoice in the festive spirit and eat to the fullest. Good luck preaching the same theory during Bakri-Eid. If there is a shortage of goats in some locality, they might ring your bell if you dare to say anything against it.

Joining both hands ensures touching the tips of all the fingers together, which are linked to pressure points in the eyes, ears, and mind. Pressing them together is said to activate these, helping us remember that person for a long time2.Sitting on a floor and eatingThis tradition is not just about sitting on the floor and eating, it is regarding sitting in the ""Sukhasan"" position and then eating. Sukhasan is the position we normally use for Yoga asanas. Sitting in this position while eating helps in improving digestion as the circulatory system can focus solely upon digestion and not on our legs dangling from a chair or supporting us while we are standing.3.Why not to sleep with your head towards North?Myth is that it invites ghost or death but science says that it is because human body has its own magnetic field (Also known as hearts magnetic field, because the flow of blood) and Earth is a giant magnet. When we sleep with head towards north, our body's magnetic field become completely asymmetrical to the Earth's Magnetic field. That cause problems related to blood pressure and our heart needs to work harder in order to overcome this asymmetry of Magnetic fields.4.Surya NamaskarHindus have a tradition of paying regards to Sun God early in the morning by their water offering ritual. It was mainly because looking at Sun rays through water or directly at that time of the day is good for eyes and also by waking up to follow this routine, we become prone to a morning lifestyle and mornings are proven to be the most effective part of the day.5.Touching feet (charan-sparsh)Usually, the person of whose feet you are touching is either old or pious. When they accept your respect which came from your reduced ego (and is called your shraddha) their hearts emit positive thoughts and energy (which is called their karuna) which reaches you through their hands and toes. In essence, the completed circuit enables the flow of energy and increases cosmic energy, switching on a quick connection between two minds and hearts. To an extent, the same is achieved through handshakes and hugs.6.Why do we fast?The underlying principle behind fasting is to be found in Ayurveda. This ancient Indian medical system sees the basic cause of many diseases as the accumulation of toxic materials in the digestive system. Regular cleansing of toxic materials keeps one healthy. By fasting, the digestive organs get rest and all body mechanisms are cleansed and corrected. A complete fast is good for health, and the occasional intake of warm lemon juice during the period of fasting prevents flatulence.Do Upvote if you agree.",4 followers,Priyam Sharma,741,87,526.4K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

Bakshi was born in 1921, in the Gulyana village near Rawalpindi, British India. After graduating from the Rawalpindi’s Gordon College in 1942, Zorawar Chand Bakshi was commissioned into the Baloch Regiment in 1943.He gave a tough time to the Japanese advancing in Burma in his first major mission during the World War II, which also earned him a Mention-in-Despatches (honour received for acts of gallantry and distinguished and meritorious service in operational areas).After India's partition in 1947, he was transferred to the 5th Gorkha Rifles of the Indian Army and was caught in thick of action during the Indo-Pak War of 1947-48.He displayed exceptional bravery and was awarded the Vir Chakra in July 1948.While the border tensions with China were on a high in 1949, Major Bakshi embarked on a secret mission to Lhasa. He disguised himself as a Tibetan monk and traversed a distance of 400 km in 80 days, across the Himalayas, to obtain vital strategic intelligence for India.He was awarded the coveted MacGregor Medal (honour given to Indian Armed Forces personnel for valuable military reconnaissance) for this secret mission in 1949.But his most historic military feat was as a Brigade Commander in the Indo-Pak War in 1965.He remained at the forefront and displayed exemplary leadership. His ability to lead his troops from the front helped the Indian army capture the strategic Haji Pir Pass in the Uri Sector from the Pakistani forces.He was then awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India's second highest gallantry medal.He was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal for commanding the battle and capturing the Chicken’s Neck (the Siliguri Corridor) during the Indo-Pak War in 1971.Later, in 1975, he went on to command the Premier 2 Corps, the largest single offensive Indian force ever mustered for war.He also played a crucial part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo in 1960s. This time,he missed the 1962 Indo-China War. In 1969, he was posted as the Major General in Nagaland where he actively participated in the counter-insurgency operations.He was not just a highly decorated officer, but was known to be a master strategist. Even after his retirement, soldiers sought his strategic advice on Siachen.He was a true military icon and a source of inspiration to the past and present generations of officers in India.Affectionately nicknamed 'Zoru' by his friends and colleagues, he was also a great human being.But, our greatest wartime hero, General Zorawar Chand Bakshi didn't receive a befitting day farewell and he was laid to rest unsung. There was no ceremonial send-off, no ritual last rites at the crematorium, no last post, no rise, and only one wreath was laid. Lt. General Zorawar Chand Bakshi, unarguably India’s greatest soldier, did not die. He simply faded away.India's highest decorated General, Zorawar Chand Bakshi fought defying all odds and changed the military history of our country.Source:-Indian Express",169 followers,Siddharth Sinha,805,159,4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

When she was four years old, she started insisting that her mother and father wereShanti’s worried parents set out to find if there was any meaning behind their daughter’s outlandish claims, and what they found out was truly unnerving. A young woman named Ludgi Devi had indeed died in childbirth at the time and in the town Shanti had specified, and the family and relatives she had described very much existed. When she eventually met her “husband from previous life,” she recognized him instantly and acted like a mother towards his child.The newspapers soon became interested and authorities as revered as Mahatma Gandhi were soon keenly watching Shanti’s case. It turned out she was not only able to remember her past lives, but she could also remember the time “in between lives”—that is, the afterlife. She claimed to haveShanti Devi went on to be a scholar, teacher, and student of religion.

Self-inflicted whippings, painful ceremonial piercings, and even self-crucifixion are examples of rituals still practiced by religious devotees today. However, one act of extreme devotion may take the cake for the most bizarre.In 1970, Sadhu Amar Bharati, abandoned traditional lifestyle and decided to completely devote himself to his religious beliefs; in particular the Hindu deity Shiva. Everything was going fine until three years later when he decided his devotion wasn’t strong enough. He wanted to show his devotion in a unique way that would also disconnect him from worldly luxuries. Amar decided to raise his right hand to the sky and keep it there, indefinitely. He’s also told journalists that he intends the act to be a protest for world peace, from neighborhood to neighborhood and around the world.As expected, Amar experienced the typical numbness and tingling that we all feel when a limb “falls asleep.” And even when that light tingling turned to extreme pain, Amar endured. After a certain amount of time, he claims the pain subsided and now the arm stands erect, seemingly on its own. The muscles have atrophied and the girth of the right arm has shrunk in relation to his left. Since clipping his nails would have required bringing the arm down, Amar hasn’t trimmed them in decades. His nails now are mangled and curl around his fingers.Perhaps even more strangely, Amar isn’t alone in his one-handed salute to Shiva. He has begun to develop a following of other Sadhus who also have a raised a hand toward the sky.

Reportedly, when he first received a telegram from the British colonial authorities in New Delhi about the rising toll of famine deaths in Bengal, his reaction was simply that he regretted that nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi was not one of the victims.British Government never formally declared state of Famine and deliberately supplied the stockpiles of food arriving from Canada & U.S.A to British Army as reserves and not to the suffering common masses in Bengal.Bengal Famine clearly depicts the British Hypocrisy as on the one hand it accused Axis Powers of Human rights violation and on the other hand killing millions of Bengalis without any apology to the Tragic events of 1943 till today.British conduct in 1943 was one of the few examples of horrors of the British Raj in India.Winston Churchill,who is still considered as a hero in Britain was one of the worst Mass Murderers that ever existed.Churchill was no different than Hitler or Stalin .He himself said,“History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it myself.”Above given images gives a very little Glimpse about the problems and horrible coditions suffered by people during the Bengal Famine during World War-2.Sad part is many of our Fellow Indians do not remember the sacrifices made by our forefathers during the World War.Many of us still don’t know about the atrocities committed on our past generations by British Raj.We fought a war which was never ours.We sacrificed for gains that were never given to us.It is quite well said that,“We even risked our lives to save the land of those who have occupied ours”.Source -",3 followers,Tilak M,584,54,2.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

The Tsunami caused millions of tonnes of Titanium Ore on the beaches .Considering that known global resources of the ore are in the region of 285 million tonnes and titanium is among the most sought-after metals in the world, you could call that a silver lining.What is Titanium ?Titanium is an important metal because of its high strength to weight ratio - it is as strong as steel, but 45 per cent lighter. It's also twice as strong as aluminium, but only 60 per cent heavier. Because of its strength, lightness, extraordinary corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures, it finds use in the aerospace industry. It is also extensively used for consumer products such as automobiles, computers and mobile phones.Valuation of the Titanium on the beaches of Tamil Nadu:1 Kg of Titanium = $ 3.651 US ton of Titanium = 907.185 * 3.65 = 3311.225Reserves of Titanium (Estimate) = 40 million Tonnes(Official figures are even more, this was just the initial estimate)Income from Only Titanium Reserves (estimate) = 3311.225 * 40 million= $ 132449.01 million =Indian Budget in 2015 was $ 280 billion. Just imagine all that money if we could extract the Titanium and other ores from the beaches of Tamil Nadu.There has been rumors that the reserves exceed 500 million tonnes, in which case we could probably become a Economic Superpower.What’s the Problem ?Its unobtainable until now. Times of India :This was largely because India had little or no capability in placer mining and the ore is essentially available in coastal placer deposits.What the CSIR project is trying to do is to make the mining of the ore commercially feasible.

In this same period, the share of 99% of India's population went down from almost two-third to less than half.Though India's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, the benefits have gone largely to the rich. In the last decade and a half, India's wealth has increased by more than 3 times – from 75 trillion rupees to 224 trillion rupees. More than 60% of this increase, or 90 trillion rupees, has gone only to the top 1%. As a result, the top 1%’s share in India's wealth has increased from 36.8% in 2000 to 53% by 2015. India's wealth distribution is even more skewed as a result.This unprecedented increase in inequality has been accompanied by a fall in human development indicators in India. India’s share in world’s hungry people has gone up from 1/5th in 1991 to 1/4th in 2015. Similarly, India's share in world illiteracy has also increased in this period.India’s children suffer from acute undernutrition – with a large percentage of children suffering from stunting and other problems. Child undernourishment in India is worse than those of countries designated Least Developed Countries (LDC). The per capita income of these LDC is less than half that of India.India has one of the most privatized health care systems in the world. Every year, 40 million Indians are pushed into poverty because of the burden of health-related out of pocket expenditures.If we divide the total wealth of all Indian families equally, the average wealth of an Indian family would be Rs. 9 lakhs in 2015. 90% of Indian families do not have this average wealth. Also, 70% of the families do not even have assets worth Rs. 3.25 lakhs -- an amount which will provide for the most basic kind housing. Just by redistributing only a fraction of the wealth – only about one-third of the 90 trillion rupees that the top 1% have amassed over the last 15 years -- all Indian families could have basic housing. Even after such a transfer, the top 1% would still have a larger share of wealth in 2015 than they had in 2000.Sources:",3 followers,Hitesh Sharma,556,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

199,That is very simple to be understood. To make fusion work you need to force all hydrogen atoms to be close to each other up to the point that hydrogen will combine with other hydrogen to form helium. You can do that by a high pressure environment or high temperature created by the fission of an uranium or plutonium atomic bomb. These neutrons works like a glue connecting protons inside the nucleus. The energy is liberated when some particles are fused to become helium liberating neutrinos and gama rays. An environment with electromagnetic energy like laser may also work out.That is very simple to be understood.

As a result, very tiny efficient fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available on earth. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239). Boron-11 is another potential fusion fuel that has excellent promise for future fusion power generation. 80.1% of natural Boron is the Boron-11 isotope and over a million tons of natural Boron is currently mined each year, mostly for making glass and laundry detergent. There is already in place a fuel supply infrastructure of p-B11 fusion when fusion reactor technology becomes a commercial reality.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion or ""alpha particles"" produced from p-B11 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Will there ever be nuclear powered tanks or War-Mechs?Perhaps not in the near term.I believe a multi-axle all wheel drive exploratory vehicle powered by He3-He3 fusion for space planetary exploration might happen before any terrestrial nuclear vehicle application.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion -",3 followers,Steve Baker,3.7K,27.3K,162.3M,https://www.quora.com/Could-thorium-reactors-be-used-for-space-travel
