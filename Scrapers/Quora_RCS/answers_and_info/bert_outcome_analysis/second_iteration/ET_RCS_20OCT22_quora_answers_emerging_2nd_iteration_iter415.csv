My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-China-has-created-an-artificial-sun

This part is the most important thing, it is decisive for the whole thing whether it is a valid project or not. When this is decided, then comes the second important thing: how fast you can go. And this part is decided by natural science --- science and technology. There is a time limit decided by the material provisions reserve to support your journey --- you have to reach your goal before your provisions run out.When our provisions --- the real value reserve on the Earth is limited, we cannot afford to go the wrong way, and the faster we go on the wrong way, the worse off we will be in this journey. And that is exactly what we are doing now: use all our science and technology to satisfy our material needs, enjoy our lives, get rich, competing for power. We lost, but we run fast; we celebrate the speed but don’t care the direction we go. How dangerous!I heard the TV news that predict human may achieve controlled fusion energy production in 50 years. I just hope human can achieve our social system transformation before that time; otherwise that breakthrough of technology will only take us towards the wrong direction much further and do us much more damage. It is not my job to speculate whether controlled fusion energy production can be achieved or when it can be achieved; what I want to do here is to estimate what will happen (what is the effect) to us if it is achieved in the future someday.1.	When the goal is wrong, everything will go wrong.Science and technology is the tool, the means to serve our goal, purpose. What purpose it serves will decide this technology will be beneficial or harmful to us for our real interest --- human perpetual survival.2.	Historical experiences on the effects of science and technology breakthroughs on human society.This part I reckon it would be better to leave to readers to do the research and draw the conclusion --- it is a series of historical facts which have been recorded, and we are living in that consequences now, and we can expect the same thing will happen in the future again and again if the rule of the game do not change. And the final result can be predicted by simple logic: real value on the Earth will be exhausted and this process will be stopped. But when that is proved by the reality of that time, the lesson will be of no use to anybody because no one can survive by then.3.	Science and technology development fundamentally cannot over pace the growth of human material needs.Under present social conditions, any science and technology break through only result in boost population and material production and consumption that only will result in real value early exhaustion and shortened life chain. It will never give us the qualitative jump onto the higher effective information plateau that can enable us to get access and use real value in space and live there.4.	Can controlled fusion energy production solve world energy problem once and for all?A rough estimation:Conditions:Data:Calculation:From this result we can see:1)	It is not a thorough solution for our energy problem.5.	Under controlled fusion energy production, can world material production and world environment loading capacity reach sustainability? What will be the survival conditions change for people in the world?Just like every breakthrough in science and technology in history, if this supposed controlled fusion energy production comes true, it will effect on human life the same way as what happened before: temporarily alleviate the limitation on people’s material needs, followed by increased population and production, consumption. Then very soon, other natural limitations will jump out as “bottle necks” in front of human material needs: land, water, soil quality, air quality, bio diversity, eco system health, human health. And people will try to open the “bottle necks” one by one, and in the meantime create more and more and bigger and bigger problems…6.	The nature of the present game --- unsustainability.In a logical sense, when real value is limited, and you want to use it the longest time span, the fundamental solution is to use it as sparely as possible in a planned way but not further dig into the possibility on how to use it more and use it quicker.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/In-layman-terms-why-are-fusion-reactors-producing-less-energy-than-it-is-fed-into-them-When-will-they-crack-the-puzzle

ITER has over the decades suffered delays, several costly redesigns, and project setbacks.The US, at project inception, pledged to pay 9.1% of the total project cost and this was originally thought to be about US$610 million dollars.Recently, Congress requested that DOE’s Office of Science’s office of project assessment (OPA) prepare an updated estimate for the US portion of ITER’s cost, using conservative assumptions based on performance to date and reasonable projections for the future. OPA’s estimate was announced by DOE.OPA’s responded with an updated estimate for the cost of the US portion of ITER -“The new cost estimate, which is a range from $4.0 to $6.5 billion, is a reflection of the historical cost growth of the project and the high level of risk and uncertainty' associated with this highly complicated international undertaking.”If you project out OPA’s estimate for the 9.1% pledge the US has made to the ITER project, the US pledge to ITER is now expected to be between US$4 billion and US$6.5 billion; according to OPA,Using DOE OPA's best estimate, the shared total ITER project cost to the international consortium is now ultimately expected to range from US$44 billion to US$75 billion.US taking a hard look at its involvement in ITERThe nuclear community needs to seriously consider the implications for the cost of fusion power plantsThere currently may be greater hope for cost competitive commercial fusion from technology implemented by small fusion startups.LPP Fusion is the name of a leading small US company innovating fusion.One of the keys to practical production of fusion power is to meet the basic conditions required for fusion (the famous Lawson criteria of temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time). At least one small fusion experiment at Lawrenceville Plasma Physics headed up by Dr. Eric Lerner has at this point technically already met the minimal conditions for D-T fusion.D + T -> 2He-4 (3.5 MeV) + neutron (14.1 MeV)The Lawson criterion for fusion ignition and break-even with D-T fusion is about 4 x 10^15 keV s/cm^3.Eric Lerner of Lawrenceville Plasma Physics reports in peer reviewed literature that his experiment has achieved 5 x 10^15 keV s/cm^3In theory, LPP should not be that far away, but they are not putting effort into D-T or D-D fusion at this time (although in the past they have made many runs using Deuterium fuel and D-D fusion). D-T fusion is the fusion reaction that is easiest to achieve - but LPP is not currently interested in going that direction.LPP isn't really interested in D-T type fusion. The ""problem"" with D-T fusion is that a lot of the energy in D-T comes in the form of 14.1 MeV high-energy neutrons, which tend to make reactor materials highly radioactive via neutron activation. In theory you can capture that energy the same way you do with a conventional nuclear reactor (that is, by using the radiation to get something like liquid Lithium hot and using it to boil water or heat molten salt to run a turbine). Part of the problem with D-T fusion is the tritium itself, which is radioactive unlike deuterium fusion fuel, and LPP doesn't want to get into all those radioactive-materials handling issues. Tritium is also very expensive to purchase (about $30,000 per gram as estimated by Los Alamos National Lab).So LPP has chosen to set their sights just a bit higher. They plan to bypass easier to achieve D-T and the cheap and very sustainable D-D fusion reaction in favor of aneutronic fusion (for me, the is a questionable and perhaps unfortunate choice - neutronic fusion producing a huge number of high value neutrons is valuable and could be used for applications like nuclear waste burning, medical isotope production, and manufacture of fuel for fission reactors, as well as producing electricity from fusion).The fusion reaction LPP prefers is called p-B-11, which uses conventional hydrogen (which becomes a bare proton, p, when ionized) and boron-11, which is over 100X more difficult to ignite in a tokamak (and is about 20X as hard to ignite in a properly designed Inertial Confinement Fusion device).[1] - Ivy-Mike nuclear test performed in 1952 -[2] - LPP at Google's Solve for X Conference - still leading the field -Historical Fact - Over the past five decades the technical advance of fusion experiments as measured by the Fusion Triple product nTt doubles every 1.8 years -this is a more rapid trend of sustained technical advance than the growth of the number of transistors on CPU chips (Moore’s Law)..",2 followers,Richard Muller,681,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-energy-crisis-be-solved-if-sustained-nuclear-fusion-became-a-reality-What-are-its-negative-effects
