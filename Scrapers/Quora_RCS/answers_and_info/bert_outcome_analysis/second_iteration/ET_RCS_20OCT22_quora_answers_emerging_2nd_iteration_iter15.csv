0,"That depends on the severity of the solar storm and/or coronal mass ejection (CME). If it would be equal to the Carrington Event (bad one in 1859) it could wipe out or severely damage a lot of our electrical, digital infrastructure. But, the earth’s magnetic field protects us from a lot of the minor stuff that the sun throws at us. Also, if the earth is not in the direct path of an event, that protects us as well. Fortunately for us, our star is relatively calm.","105,624 followers",Dave Consiglio,600,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-to-cryptocurrency-if-a-solar-storm-were-to-hit-earth-Would-it-be-lost-for-the-rest-of-time-or-would-we-still-have-access-to-our-wallets

2,"Israel (together with Cyprus) is the world's leader in per-capita use of solar water systems. About 90 percent of all Israeli homes are equipped with these systems, which meet about four percent of the country's total energy demand, saving about two billion barrels of oil a year! One of Israel's premier companies, Chromagen, has already exported its system to more than 35 countries worldwide. Expected to reach full capacity in 2013, another Israeli project, the Ivanpah project, will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 400,000 tons annually, the equivalent of taking about 70,000 cars oIsrael (together with Cyprus) is the world's leader in per-capita use of solar water systems.

3,"Currently there are more than 1800 altcoins available. Most of these coins are rip offs with the exception of a few like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin,…, basically the old guys.Although, bitcoin maximalists claim that there are no real world use-cases for other currencies. We believe that all the money, time and resources should be spent on improving Bitcoin hence rendering all other altcoins useless. so bitcoin is most likely your best bet.",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,1.1K,54,909.5K,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-to-cryptocurrency-if-a-solar-storm-were-to-hit-earth-Would-it-be-lost-for-the-rest-of-time-or-would-we-still-have-access-to-our-wallets

Fundamental Analysis.‘Fundamental analysis’ simply means the foundations of an investment – their team, their ambitions, their strengths etcHere are 10 Easy Ways To Pick Which Cryptocurrency To Invest In1. The Community.A bit part of a cryptocurrency’s success is it’s following – so look out for cryptocurrencies with strong communities and loyal followers because that shows people have a genuine interest and belief in the cryptocurrency.Run through some subreddits, YouTube channels and some of the feedback from their communities – and see what they’re saying about your potential investment.2. Fundamental Analysis.‘Fundamental analysis’ simply means the foundations of an investment – their team, their ambitions, their strengths etc.If you’re new to cryptocurrency, don’t sweat the technical stuff!In the long run, fundamental analysis is going to help you just as much as technical analysis.So understanding how to do fundamental analysis will help you make better investment decisions. And in a market where most people are chasing after low quality altcoins, fundamental analysis allows you to separate the wheat from the chaff.3. The Team.One of the top things you can research is the cryptocurrency’s team. In fact, researching and vetting the team behind a cryptocurrency is one of the most important factors you can look into.4. The Technology.A big part of a cryptocurrency’s success is the underlying technology:You have to understand how it’s going to perform against their competitors – and what makes the technology stand out from the crowd. Look out for the big innovators – the cryptocurrencies that will completely disrupt their industry.5. The White Paper.Everytime a new cryptocurrency is released, they usually bring out a white paper too. This will outlines the purpose of the coin, it’s technology, how it works and it’s overall vision (I’ll come onto that next).A white paper is one the best places to evaluate the fundamentals of a coin – and you should never invest anything into it until you’ve read their white paper.6. Their Vision.The vision of the cryptocurrency is really important:You want to make sure this coin will be around for at least the next 5-10 to ten years, and if they’re not thinking long term then you should be seriously worried.You should only invest in a cryptocurrency with a strong vision that can go the distance and pay off in the long-run. While short-term gains can be exciting and you might be thinking about swing trading, you should still think about where the cryptocurrency is going to be in the next 5, 10, 20 years, etc.7. Their Leadership.The success of a coin is navigated by the leadership team – they’re the ones who make all the big decisions!The leaders are the ones that carry out the vision, so research their team and look at what they’ve achieved so far.8. Pricing History.Pricing fluctuations gives you a strong history of the coin and if it will be a solid investment for the future.9. Credibility & Reputation.Is the cryptocurrency respected online? Do they have a strong reputation?At the end of the day, if they have a bad reputation then you know you probably shouldn’t invest your money into them – you really need to have strong credibility and trust to be successful in this field.So run some google searches, look through crypto communities and see what people are saying about the coin.10. The Road Map.When you’re deciding which cryptocurrency to invest in, you should look for a coin with a solid road map and strong plans for development.This is the key if you’re looking for long term success.","55,746 followers",Loy Machedo,582,5.7K,66.2M,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-is-the-best-way-to-use-solar-energy-for-cryptocurrency-mining

You will be getting a list of things a note could purchase. And NOW?What is your excuse now? Inflammation?Since USD value was divorced from the Gold standard by then US president Nixon in 1971. fiat became invalid. People often imagine that the value of money is tied to a physical commodity but this is no longer true.So, we imagined that just because a government backed up a currency, there would be more control and safety but we are not 100% correct! There are some, but not as much as we were assured. If a central bank (a consortium) decide to manipulate the currency, it is very easy to do so. A government can decide to devalue everything in a country overnightWhy Crypto?It is controlled by a decentralized, distributed network of users with equal control. Progress is controlled by consensus — that is a key innovation. There is not ‘elected people’ to make a decision, we do ourselves.Crypto breaks people’s reliance on the government, it democratizes their ability to persist and subsist.I do believe crypto is just a start; the big picture is not out yet. Block chain is the next WEB.We will be going forward to the block chain benefits in no time. Now we are in the starting stage, consider as in early era of Internet.Future’s apple, Amazon, facebook and google has not out yet, they probably are getting shaped in some dorms or out houses and I am sure some of them are in China!So, yes Cryptos will do have shining future, but invest in those who actually solve a problem- don’t just throw your money just because of some hype. Buy “apple’’ and google shares at the early stage, not some “…jhkh.com” sharesHope I helped",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-is-the-best-way-to-use-solar-energy-for-cryptocurrency-mining
