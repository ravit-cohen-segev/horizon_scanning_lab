0,"Cutting off the fuel supply.Inside a tokamak fusion reactorIn a fission reactor, the fuel (enriched uranium, usually) sits in the reactor, spitting out thermal neutrons at just the right energy to split uranium atoms, making more neutrons, and so on, in what is known as a chain reaction.Getting the fuel to spit out just enough neutrons to stay hot so that useful energy can be gotten from the reactor, but not so hot that things start to melt that shouldn’t melt is a tricky engineering problem, and is an exercise in careful management of moderators, working fluid, fuel, and temperature control.Cutting off the fuel supply.Inside a tokamak fusion reactorIn a fission reactor, the fuel (enriched uranium, usually) sits in the reactor, spitting out thermal neutrons at just the right energy to split uranium atoms, making more neutrons, and so on, in what is known as a chain reaction.Getting the fuel to spit out just enough neutrons to stay hot so that useful energy can be gotten from the reactor, but not so hot that things start to melt that shouldn’t melt is a tricky engineering problem, and is an exercise in careful management of moderators, working fluid, fuel, and temperature control. Sometimes something breaks, and the balancing act is knocked off its balance. If you’re lucky, the thing that breaks makes fewer neutrons so it cools down, and you’ve no worries except some downtime, an expensive repair bill, and the cost of restarting the reactor.If you’re unlucky, the thing that breaks leads to more neutrons being made, which makes things hotter, which means that more things break, which leads to things getting hotter, and so on. If you’reFor example, at Fukushima Daiichi, the 2011 tsunami flooded the reactor buildings. Reactors 4, 5, and 6 were shut down for maintenance, so they were okay. The remaining reactors were automatically shut down when the earthquake causing the tsunami hit. But great lumps of uranium take time to cool down from their operating temperatures, and require active cooling measures to do so, being well insulated to prevent energy loss during normal operation.The emergency generators powering the cooling systems were disabled by the flooding, so the cores got hotter, leading to them melting. In two of the reactor buildings, the general disarray lead to hydrogen gas being generated from the water in the reactor over the next few days, which exploded, wrecking the buildings.Note that these explosions were notIn a thermonuclear or fusion reactor, deuterium and tritium are compressed in magnetic fields at high temperature until they fuse, making helium and a neutron. The neutron flies free of the reaction and is captured by lithium cladding to produce heat and more tritium. In a commercial reactor, when we have those, the heat will drive steam turbines, just like a fission reactor. The cladding is processed to extract the tritium to be used as fuel later. The helium is drawn off, and more deuterium and tritium fuel is added to keep the reaction going.Note that, unlike the fission reactor, this isAnother failure state might be if the plasma becomes dynamically unstable and collides with the walls of the vacuum chamber. This will probably cause some damage to the cladding and magnets, collapsing the magnetic field and necessitating some expensive repairs. It is unlikely to cause a breach of the reactor; the plasma only contains a few grams of fuel at any one time.If by some combination of bad design and mismanagement the reactor chamber was breached, again this would be a purely mechanical failure. There might be something you could call an explosion as the high-pressure, high temperature plasma escapes into the atmosphere, but it would be stretching it to call it aEven if you could somehow arrange forSo, a fusion reactor big enough to threaten the world isn’t really a thing*, and if it was, you’d only have to cut off the fuel.*Except for the obvious:But how to stop the Sun destroying the planet is another question.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

2,"Personally, I find the traditional explanation of the products of the nuclear reaction having less mass than the initial reagents to be non-intuitive, and back-to-front.For me, it is far more intuitively satisfying to start from the observation that the 92 naturally occuring elements of the periodic table are distinguished by the number of protons that are present in the atomic nucleus (from Z=1, for hydrogen, up to Z=92, for uranium). Then, we note that positive charges repel, so there must be some sort of stabalising influence present in each of the nuclei from Z=2 to Z=92. This is providedPersonally, I find the traditional explanation of the products of the nuclear reaction having less mass than the initial reagents to be non-intuitive, and back-to-front.For me, it is far more intuitively satisfying to start from the observation that the 92 naturally occuring elements of the periodic table are distinguished by the number of protons that are present in the atomic nucleus (from Z=1, for hydrogen, up to Z=92, for uranium). Then, we note that positive charges repel, so there must be some sort of stabalising influence present in each of the nuclei from Z=2 to Z=92. This is provided by the presence of a certain number of neutrons. Although these do not neutralise the electrostatic field, since they are electrically neutral, they do contribute to the strong nuclear force, which balances against the aforementioned electrostatic repulsion. How many neutrons are required to achieve this balance is not a simple linear one, but can be simplified by treating its black-box outside appearance as giving rise to a “binding energy” within the atomic nucleus.Now, if you plot a graph of the binding energy required for each of the elements, from Z=1 to Z=92, you get a jagged curve with a roughly elongated U-shape that reaches a minimum around Z=26 (iron). This means that if you pick a big atomic nucleus (uranium for example) and split it into two smaller nuclei (barium and krypton, for example) the products need less binding energy, in total, than the inital nucleus. Similarly, if you fuse two small nuclei (two isotopes of hydrogen, for example, deuteriim and tritium) to make a bigger nucleus (helium plus nilium (a free neutron)) again you need less binding energy in the products than in the initial nuclei. The surplus energy is released in either reaction, usually manifesting itself as increased kinetic energy of one or more of the product nuclei, which can then be made to collide with a surrounding water jacket, to raise a head of steam, to turn an electricity turbine.And Einstein’s equation. Yes, that can now be considered. If you now want to plot a graph of atomic mass against atomic number (from Z=1 to Z=92) you can count up the number of protons, and the number of neutrons PLUS the amount of binding energy (where its contribution is calculated using m=E/c^2). So, that is why I said at the beginning that I consider the traditional reply to your question to get this equation into the mix in the opposite way to the one that seems intuitively meaningful (at least in my opinion).","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-could-stop-a-thermonuclear-reactor-from-destroying-the-planet

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-could-stop-a-thermonuclear-reactor-from-destroying-the-planet
4,"Illustrations are always a good way to explain concepts.In an uncontrolled fission reaction, you get an atomic bomb going off.

The hot gas from the reactor heats up water to produce steam that turns the steam turbines, which turn the power generators to produce electricity.The reason for the coolingIllustrations are always a good way to explain concepts.In an uncontrolled fission reaction, you get an atomic bomb going off.

The hot gas from the reactor heats up water to produce steam that turns the steam turbines, which turn the power generators to produce electricity.The reason for the cooling tower is to help to supply cooler temperature water to the steam turbine exhaust to condense the steam to water, in order to reduce back pressure. This helps to increase power output of the turbines to turn the generators.The radioactive waste from fission, especially the Kr (Krypton) and Ba (Barium) components are the most radioactive, and will remain dangerous to all living things for many thousands of years. They are currently buried around the nuclear power plants, but likely to be stored in the Yucca Mountains, NV in the future.In aDeuterium and Tritium are isotopes of hydrogen. Hydrogen has one proton, but deuterium has a neutron in addition to the proton. Tritium has two neutrons + a proton. So, when a deuterium and a tritium are fused, a helium atom is produced along with a fast neutron (14 MeV), heat and gamma radiation. This is called a D-T reaction. There are other atoms that will work too, but the conditions for a D-T reaction is less demanding than others.Below is a generic illustration of a Tokamak fusion reactor design. So far, it’s the most favored design amongst several fusion reactor designs. Tokamak means toroidal machine, and this design was originated from Russia. The purple color “donut” represents the plasma, there are many different types of magnetic coils to confine the plasma within the vacuum vessel.The heat released from the fusion reaction is not the only heat source. The fast neutrons impinge upon the lithium wall lining (blanket) of the reactor vessel will generate a great deal of heat and split some of the lithium into tritium as new fuel.Roughly, 1% of the ocean water is deuterium, so it’s sustainable for a long time. Tritium is produced from irradiating lithium (reactor lining/blanket). Tritium was also used at one time as a radioluminescent for watches and other instruments.In terms of radioactive waste, the fusion reactor core will have the highest radioactivity, but in 50-years it will become low-level activity for another 100-years; and in 500-years, it will be no more radioactive than coal ash.Since it is difficult to get a fusion reaction going, any contamination, vacuum pressure insufficiently low, variation in the magnetic fields, RF heating or neutral beam injection issues, will not initiate or quench the entire reaction immediately. That’s why there’s no chance for a runaway reaction as is in fission. Also, deuterium is metered-in with many safeguards. So, any of the tight-tolerance requirements are out by the slightest, no chance for a fusion reaction.Still not convinced of its natural inability to do self-fusion? Here’s what we had to do on the older experimental fusion reactors several generations ago using hydrogen as a stand-in for the D-T fuel to try to create the plasma conditions to enable a fusion reaction to occur. These are probably much less sophisticated than what’s being done today on the newer fusion reactors, but may not be too far off.The vacuum vessel had to be pumped-down for nearly 2-days, using turbo-molecular pumps at the last stage to make sure there are no free-floating particles left in the vacuum vessel. These are the coil systems to help to support, heat and compress the plasma to 100-million degrees C:The timing of when these coils come on and increase their field strength is critical. The TF coils come on to establish the toroidal field corridor for the plasma to be shaped like a donut. The PF coils come on to help maintain vertical and horizontal stability of the plasma. The DF coils come on to divert any impurities within the plasma space that might quench the reaction. The CF coils come on to compress the plasma to reduce the volume of the toroidal plasma to increase plasma temperature (adiabatic heating). The OH coils come on and collapses its magnetic field through the plasma in the x-y plane to generate a current in the plasma (z-direction) and create ohmic heating within the plasma. At the same time, microwave is guide-in radially to add more energy into the plasma to heat it (similar to today’s microwave oven). Also, at the same time neutral beam is firing protons without a net charge into the plasma to increase plasma temperature through particle collisions. All of these events happen in less than a second. If 100-million deg-C is not achieved within that time period, everything shuts down.So, without many dozens of critical events properly coordinated in timing and varying magnitude of intensity, a fusion reaction just won’t happen. This is also true with all other fusion mechanisms. The other one of the two popular fusion reactor design is Inertial Confinement, where many high-powered laser beams are focused on a small D-T pellet about the size of a pea. All the beams must hit the pellet at the exact same time to implode the pellet with extreme high energy to create the 100-million deg-C temperature, a minimum ion density and hold those conditions for a certain time period (usually less than a second). No runaway reaction without more pellets or coordinated beams.On the TFTR machine, they achieve Q=1 (or better); meaning they got more energy out than put in. This is not creating energy, it’s converting atoms to a lower energy state, and harvesting that extra energy during formation. It’s getting so expensive that in 1986, the nations who are working on fusion energy decided to pool their money and talents to build an international fusion reactor, and is called the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor (ITER), to be built in south of France.Member nations include: China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States.ITER will be the largest Tokamak ever built, and the goal is to demonstrate commercial feasibility with Q >= 10; meaning inputting 50 MW of heating power with 500 MW of fusion power.

Most fission reactors use ordinary, light water. That includes probably all U.S. reactors and the infamous Fukushima Daichii which others have talked about. These reactors rely on enriched uranium, usually to four or five percent U-235, which can be made to reach criticality more easily than natural uranium.Heavy (deuterium) water reactors, such as the Canadian designed CANDU reactor, use natural uranium with only 0.7 percent U-235 content. They rely on heavy water to better moderate the reactions, allowing neutrons released in the chain reactions to slow down enough that they will be captured by the small proportion of U-235 atoms. I'm no expert, but my understanding is that any fission reactions would quickly dissipate if regular water were used inside such a reactor. There would be no criticality, no chain reaction, and the uranium rods would just sit there mostly inert.In short, the answer is that ordinary water could not be substituted for heavy water in heavy water reactors.

It can sieve particles smaller than an atom. Acquiring the ability to separate particles smaller than an atom using a membrane at room temperature was unthinkable even to me not long ago. Such graphene filters could enable low cost production of Deuterium for a fusion ship.Graphene was discovered by Nobel laureates and professors Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at Manchester University in 2004 and has astonished the world of materials science with its range of unusual characteristics, such as its atomic-scale thinness, extreme strength and high electrical conductivity.A novel property of graphene is its ability to filter the different atomic isotopes of hydrogen, namely tritium and deuterium, from ordinary hydrogen[1].The rare form of hydrogen, deuterium, is only present in nature in very small amounts. For every 6,420 hydrogen atoms, there is just one atom of deuterium, and increasing the concentration of deuterium to produce Deuterium by conventional methods is somewhat intensive and expensive.The Manchester researchers showed that graphene can act as a simple filter by slowing down the movement of deuterium through a membrane made of graphene and its sister material, boron nitride. Ordinary hydrogen atoms passed straight through the sieve, but deuterium is effectively blocked.Mankind currently possesses impure practical Inertial Confinement Fission-Fusion (ICF) technology which could be directly employed to build fusion powered ships.DD fusion of pure Deuterium is not a practical fusion reaction for Magnetic Confinement Fusion reactors trying to reach and exceed break-even energy but is a practical fusion reaction for producing useful fusion energy with energy gain in ICF fusion reactors which operate with fusion plasma that is literally 10^11 times more dense than the plasma used in tokamak experiments like ITER.(more information)[1] -","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-simple-way-of-explaining-Nuclear-Fission-and-Fusion-Power

Basically it is like taking a lesson from the Orion Project, only instead of detonating nuclear bombs you create a contained nuclear reaction to propel the ship.Another way to go about it would be to use superconductors inside the main chamber in a wider circular configuration and along the exit path of the engine in a ever more narrow configuration. You then focus the electromagnetic field created in such a way that the field is used to push the ship.

What’s stopping us from getting higher speeds in space since there’s no resistance in space?”Short answer: ThrustA typical rocket burns fuel to make thrust. Out of fuel = out of thrust = no faster will you go.There’s a neat thing called “the rocket equation” that points out if you want more thrust, you need more fuel. More fuel means more weight, and that means you won’t go much faster even with the extra fuel.

More fuel means more weight, and that means you won’t go much faster even with the extra fuel. This just means going faster means taking more fuel with you, and we don’t mean a little extra fuel… it takes more and more and more to go faster.So that’s rocket fuel, but there are other ways to get going faster, and the most significant is gravity. Voyager II famously got a lot of mileage out of gravity assist “slingshots” as will the new Parker Solar Probe.But maybe you want to keep accelerating. For that, you need some other source of thrust. There do exist electromagnetic thrusters which make extremely efficient use of their “fuel”. By using electrical power to provide the energy, these can accelerate their “fuel” particles to ludicrous exit velocities. These things tend to provide a very tiny amount of thrust, but they do it for a very long time. That could add up to higher final speeds than what we get with chemical rockets.Finally, to get unbounded speed, you need something with no fuel limits. (Edit: Andy below commented on my poor wording here… cleaning it up.) Theoretically, a solar sail could harness the momentum of light to provide thrust. But now we’re talking a TRULY tiny amount of thrust, and only while you’re flying away from the Sun, and only when close to it. There’s still some hope for the EM drive I guess. Presumably that would be better than a photon drive… somehow. Realistically, the solar panels are needed for infinite power, but to get decent thrust out of it, you really want a nuclear reactor.Since we’ve mentioned that light has momentum, we should mention light sails. There is talk of a plan to build a tiny light sail and hit it with a massive laser array. In that way, the energy used to accelerate it is coming from a remote source that doesn’t have to move. That would make the top speed of the craft bounded only by the amount of laser energy you could generate here… and relativity of course.Finally, I should mention project Orion. The plan with Orion was to power a spacecraft with nuclear explosions. You’d literally drop a nuke behind your rocket and set it off to give you a massive boost of thrust. The energy-to-mass ratio on a nuke is off the charts, so if you really needed to get moving fast, that’s probably how you’d have to do it.","10,085 followers",Nancy Malar,4K,678,11.6M,https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-simple-way-of-explaining-Nuclear-Fission-and-Fusion-Power

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

But they also were looking for funding.So it’s firmly ingrained in my psyche that it will never happen. But never say never. I’m into share investing and this guy Jeff Brown reckons it’s just around the corner. There are several private companies that seem to be moving fast.Here’s what he wrote. If you think he’s writing bollocks don’t blame me, I’m just reporting what he said, as it’s what’s going on right now.The biggest nuclear fusion deal to date…Vancouver-based General Fusion just announced a major deal with the U.K.’s Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Per the partnership, General Fusion will build and operate a nuclear fusion reactor on the UKAEA’s Culham Campus.This is one of the most exciting developments in the industry to date. And General Fusion is one of the most promising companies in this space. I’ll explain why in a minute.But first, let’s bring newer readers up to speed on fusion technology.Nuclear fusion involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean. Unlike nuclearAnd there are different technological approaches to building nuclear fusion reactors. We don’t yet know if there will be one predominant way, but I’m excited that the industry is developing so many different approaches.General Fusion’s approach is called Magnetized Target Fusion. It entails generating a plasma reaction in a spherical reactor at extremely hot temperatures – temperatures that are hotter than the Sun.The reactors can be developed in a way so that they are compact. And they don’t take immense amounts of space and money to build. We can think of these compact reactors as being powerful enough to feed 100,000 homes.This would allow us to build a decentralized network of fusion reactors. That would in turn create an energy grid that is far more resilient than the more centralized power grid that is typical of what we see today.Of course, that’s if the technology can be deployed economically at scale.That’s why General Fusion’s deal with the UKAEA is so important. It will enable the company to build a reactor, get it up and running, and then assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs.If so, all that’s left to do is build more reactors. General Fusion would have no problem securing the funding it needs once its technology has been proven.In fact, the company already has an impressive list of backers, which includes Jeff Bezos – and yours truly. And I even got in at a better price than Bezos on this one.And perhaps most exciting, this deal is moving at an accelerated timeline. General Fusion will start building its reactor next year.From there, the company expects to have the reactor operational within three years. It should be fully functional by 2025.As we’ve discussed before,We are no more than a few years away from the first fusion reactors producing more energy than that required to power them. That means limitless, clean, and essentially “free” energy for all.….So to your point, if we are to be objective, rational, and smart about energy production when planning for the future, we must look at the whole picture – how energy is manufactured, the dangers or complexities involved in its use, the negative environmental impacts, and how and if materials can be recycled when they have reached the end of their useful life.And these are some of the reasons I speak so highly of nuclear fusion. I truly believe it’s the future of clean energy production.Nuclear fusion (not fission) will generate truly clean energy without many of the drawbacks I listed above. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion can create energy without radioactive waste. And the fusion reactors will actually have small footprints. They just won’t take up that much space.And the good news is that we’re getting close to making it a reality.As I wroteThat’s why, within just a few years, I expect we’ll start seeing nuclear fusion becoming one of the hottest topics in the world of technology.A major milestone for nuclear fusion…On Christmas Eve, the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) fusion device in South Korea maintained a high-temperature plasma for 20 seconds. This is the longest sustained nuclear fusion reaction ever.While 20 seconds may not sound like much, it is a big deal.Back in 2018, KSTAR was only able to maintain plasma for 1.5 seconds. In 2019, it was able to get this up to eight seconds. And now it is at 20 seconds.All things being relative, KSTAR has increased the duration of its reactions by 13 times in just two years. That’s a clear sign of exponential growth.And get this – the reaction occurred at over 100 million degrees Celsius. That’s nearly seven times hotter than the Sun, which can reach 15 million degrees Celsius.As a reminder, nuclear fusion is essentially the power of the Sun. It involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean. Unlike nuclearThe hardest part of the process is maintaining plasma to sustain the reaction. That’s why KSTAR’s progress is evidence that nuclear fusion is coming much faster than anyone realizes.The experts say that we are at least 10–15 years away from being able to generate clean energy using nuclear fusion technology. But when I look at the progress KSTAR and others are making, I can confidently say they are wrong. I predict that we will have a functioning nuclear fusion reactor within the next five years.Pretty soon KSTAR will be at one minute. Then 10 minutes. Then an hour. And in time, it will be able to sustain net energy production. That’s when the reactor produces more energy than it takes to run.This will be one of the most important scientific developments to watch this year.We’ll keep a close eye on KSTAR’s progress in 2021. And I predict that at least one other nuclear fusion project will make a major breakthrough in the space this year.The race to build the world’s first nuclear fusion reactor is on…We talked about nuclear fusionNot to be confused with nuclearAnd Commonwealth Fusion Systems just released seven peer-reviewed scientific papers that reveal how its fusion reactors will work. This is the first time a private company has published its work on the science behind its own nuclear fusion technology.Here’s what Commonwealth’s reactors will look like:Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ ReactorSource: Commonwealth Fusion SystemsAs we can see, the reactors employ a spherical design, more specifically like a donut with a core in the middle. And they use superconducting magnets to control the plasma when in operation.And get this – each of these reactors could fit in a space the size of a tennis court. That means these reactors could give rise to a robust, decentralized electric grid.Rather than building one massive plant that costs tens of billions of dollars like other nuclear fusion projects have tried (for example, ITER in Europe), Commonwealth will be able to build many of these compact reactors at a fraction of that cost.And each of these reactors will be able to produce 10 times the energy it takes to run them. In other words, 10 units of energy will come out for every one unit of energy that goes in. That basically means nearly free and limitless clean energy for the planet.Commonwealth announced that it is in the process of developing the superconducting magnets right now. The company will conduct extensive testing on these magnets next year, and it plans to begin construction on its first fusion reactor before 2021 is out. That will keep the company on pace for achieving net energy production by 2025.This is such an exciting development. And it sets up a two-horse race in the industry.We have talked about TAE Technologies before. In fact, I’ve published a special research report profiling the work TAE is doing. Readers who missed that report can find itTAE is taking a different approach to nuclear fusion. And the company believes that it can achieve net energy production by 2024.I’m so excited to see not one but three private, early stage technology companies pursuing this incredible goal.The third company is General Fusion in Vancouver, Canada. Solar and wind power generation are great, and we should continue to use those technologies.But with very few exceptions, they are simply not capable of generating baseload, utility-scale energy production. And without that, we’ll never have a shot at getting the world off of carbon-based fuels.Within three years, nuclear fusion will become one of the hottest topics in the world of technology. If you’re reading this, you are already far more knowledgeable about the technology than 99.99% of the population, and I plan on keeping my readers on the bleeding edge.Limitless clean energy will be here by 2025…Commonwealth Fusion Systems recently raised $84 million in a Series A2 venture capital (VC) round. We talk about VC rounds frequently in these pages, but this one is especially noteworthy. Why?This money will be used to develop and build a nuclear fusion reactor.Not to be confused with nuclearFirst conceived in 1920 by British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, nuclear fusion is simply the energy that powers the Sun.More specifically, nuclear fusion is the combination, at very high temperatures, of two separate nuclei to form a new nucleus. In that process, huge amounts of energy are released.The Sun combines atoms of hydrogen to form helium atoms plus energy. That energy travels all the way to Earth to provide the light and heat that we need to survive. (For anybody who’d like a more detailed explanation of nuclear fusion, pleaseNuclear fusion offers limitless clean energy. And Commonwealth Fusion Systems plans to bring it to us by 2025.I met some members of the Commonwealth Fusion Systems team not too long ago at a small, private conference. The company was spun out of MIT, and it is making amazing progress. It plans to pick a site for its first nuclear fusion reactor later this year.From there, the team’s goal is to have the reactor producing “net energy production” by 2025. That term refers to the point when the reactor’s energy output exceeds the energy input needed to run the fusion reactor.More output than input is why nuclear fusion can provide unlimited clean energy. When this happens, energy costs will plummet. And equally important, carbon emissions will do the same.This Series A2 funding round will help Commonwealth Fusion complete the technical development of its reactor. I expect the company will raise more capital next year to finance the construction of the reactor itself.And it won’t have any problem raising as much money as it needs.Commonwealth Fusion Systems is backed by several big VC firms as well as two multinational energy conglomerates, Equinor and Eni. Plus, the company is backed by several divisions of the U.S. government and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.Commonwealth’s approach is a very practical and useful. It is designing a compact nuclear fusion reactor that can be used the world over for industrial settings as well as residential areas.If we think about all the problems that come with other forms of energy – geopolitical tensions surrounding oil and environmental issues from coal – nuclear fusion technology solves these problems for good.As we are only a few years away from what I predict will be the world’s first net energy-producing nuclear fusion reactor, I believe that venture funding in this space is set to rapidly increase. Fortunes are going to be made by the company, or companies, that develop nuclear fusion reactors.Ok that’s about it. He thinks nuclear fusion is 3 years away! It may well be that private enterprise speeds things up, as with Space-X.

Yes, it’s clean and offers essentially infinite amount of power just about anywhere on Earth. Sure, that’s great and all, but it pales with the fact the term “finite resource” can be cosigned to history. We wouldn’t even need the Sun any more.

26,"Very close and very far at the same time I’m afraid.ITER in France is one of the frontrunnersRight now there are several promising experimental reactors that seem destined to achieve what might be the Holy Grail of energy, a self-sustained fusion reactor where the energy of plasma exceeds the energy used to power all the magnets and other equipment to sustain the reaction. In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power foVery close and very far at the same time I’m afraid.ITER in France is one of the frontrunnersRight now there are several promising experimental reactors that seem destined to achieve what might be the Holy Grail of energy, a self-sustained fusion reactor where the energy of plasma exceeds the energy used to power all the magnets and other equipment to sustain the reaction. In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power for billions (yes, with a B) of years, well beyond when the Sun runs out of hydrogen.On the other hand all of these projects are very far from being useful. See, producing more energy in plasma than what you put in via magnets is an important milestone, but the one you should be looking at is not the energy of plasma, it’s the energy you can harvest from that plasma. It’s mostly thermal energy and the conversion factor of that to electric power is usually around 1/2. So even these reactors won’t actually be producing more electric power than what they need to power them. They’d have to produce approximately twice that much just to break even.But wait, breaking even still only means you’re running the reactor without external input. You aren’t putting any energy in the grid yet at this point, all you’re doing is producing small quantities of helium. For the reactor to become commercially viable, it needs to produce energy far in excess of that and you need to account for energy needed to generate adequate deuterium and possibly tritium to run the core.That’s why even the furthest advanced fusion reactors are still very far removed from being useful as a power source. It is hoped that once we manage to produce a reactor that will put more energy out than it needed to run it, smaller incremental improvements will follow quickly and the next two steps will not need an exorbiant amount of time. Math seems to suggest we’ll be able to extract several times the energy we put in, that’s why these projects are being financed in the first place.But don’t count on fusion power plant construction starting in mid-2030s either.
