Here are a couple other barriers to fusion:More concretely, (in the USA) Dr.He has been there through the good and the bad times. In 2012, he wrote: “Dr. Dean really makes the case that since the 1980’s, fusion has never received the funding it needed to develop.

There was a collection of underfunded and ignored small teams trying to make it a reality. The public was not paying attention. The government (specifically the US government) had a high paid team of researchers working on it, who were trying to make a high powered device to fling people into the air.

Smaller, spherical tokamaks, super-conducting magnets and lots of practical and theoretical calculations indicate that we are really close to net energy gain - continuously - in systems that have been studied and the physics pretty much under control.One of the less-understandable problems for the general public to grasp is handling of tritium, one of the two isotopes used for fusion. Tritium is a gas, just like hydrogen, and is both a fuel and a product of the fusion reaction; but it happens to be radio-active. It is not at all, really, serious: the amounts around a fusion facility will be very small, it has a half-life of 12 years, the radiation emitted (beta radiation) cannot penetrate clothing, skin or indeed almost anything will shield it. But when regulatory bodies (and indeed the lay public) see “radiation” they imagine tons of radioactive waste building up. Yes, tritium is radioactive, and should be controlled, but it is not at all like uranium, plutonium and the other scary radioactive materials in the nuclear energy world. And this is one of the major reasons experiments on D/T fusion are limited (another is the extremely high price of tritium!).So, where is fusion now and what’s the future? At present, entrepreneurship and leadership in the fusion community, worldwide, is lacking. I am firmly convinced that net fusion energy can be achieved, now, using a number of today’s cutting-edge but proven technologies.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

7,"Fusion is quite easy… but we need sustainable fusion where more energy is produced than used for reaction. So, we can fuse atoms easily, but we spent much more energy to make deuterium atoms to fuse. This is caused by low fusion reaction crossection. And, because we can’t manipulate gravity, we need to utilize electromagnetic fields instead. We need as dense plasma as possible, but the best reactors manage only about 3Bar pressure of plasma. Therefore to get atoms to fuse faster, we need more much extreme temperatures than those in core of star. And that cost additional energy.

We hope that ITER will be big enough._________________________________________________In the core of the Sun the pressures are extreme. So even if the fusion probability are calculated to be about 10^-650(fusion shouldn’t be possible) the nuclei are so close together that the quantum tunnelling occurs which rises the probability of two atoms to fuse to about 10^-10. That is still low probability, but here comes the total number of atoms in the reactor(stellar core). The low probability of fusion keeps our sun to fuse atoms even after 4.5 billion years. If the fusion probability was higher, the sun would be burning faster, would have higher energy output… it would live much shorter. Large stars would be impossible, these would explode during their formation. If the probability was higher then for example Jupiter or even small gas giants would be stars. But due small size they would spent fusible material faster.

Beryllium is a pretty good reflector in that is has a low absorption cross section for neutrons and even has a (n, 2n) reaction such that I believe, that at least some neutron energies, that it actually contributes some neutrons to the chain reaction.Consequently you have less than a critical mass of plutonium, that is less than is critical as a bare sphere, going critical due to having a reflector of neutrons. The principle here is that the reflector reflects some of the neutrons that would other be lost to the chain reaction.As spheres have the largest volume to surface ratio, they are the best configuration for criticality.Beryllium is also a low atomic mass nucleus. This means that a neutron can lose a lot of energy in a collision with beryllium - the beryllium will act as a moderator. This means that the reflected neutrons will be at an energy that is more likely to cause fission in the plutonium.Wherever I said plutonium in the above, I was thinking Pu239. I assume that the sphere was nearly pure Pu239.All of these facts point to the probability that this was close to the smallest reactor possible.A sphere of a substance made of Pu239 and a moderator, say zirc hydride, perhaps could be smaller but I don’t know of a reactor made this way.",UNKNOWN,Kirk,640,1.9K,17.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-possible-on-earth-yet

So, a well-developed LFTR technology would be much better for powering submarines and other vehicles (though still too large for cars).
