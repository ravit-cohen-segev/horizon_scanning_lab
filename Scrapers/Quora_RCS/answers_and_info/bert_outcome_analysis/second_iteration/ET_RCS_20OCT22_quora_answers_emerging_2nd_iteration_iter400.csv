THE SILVER MAGNETS ARE POWERED SUPER MAGNETS. MERY EXPENSIVE.A much more effective and timely option could be the development of Next Generation, Generation 4, Fission reactors that will be much easier to build. Gen 4 reactors are less complex. But it is slowed down by testing of materials and equipment. And in some countries, the difficult bureaucratic process is expensive and time-consuming. With more efficient development fission reactors could be developed much faster. As it is being done in China.I think a number of prototypes could be built in 10 years and operational reactors could be in production in factories and shipyards. Most of the research, material, designs and equipment is already available. It would be less complex than the Manhattan project that started from scratch in 5 years. China is about the only country seriously developing Generation 4 reactors.+Generation 4 reactors are designs that are highly resistant to meltdowns even with failure of pumps and power for cooling. Using natural, physical properties There are a number of different types using a variety of coolants and fuels.China has just started operation of an air-cooled reactor using a pebble bed system with fuels in spheres of very heat resistant materials with long lifespans and easy testing and replacement. Natural air circulation can maintain cooling if it is needed. The reactor does not need to be shut down to refuel it.China is also developing a Molten SaltReactor, MSR, and a Travelling Wave reactor. The MSR uses molten salt for cooling, heat transfer and actually contains the nuclear fuel and moves it through a graphite reactor core. The salt can operate at higher temperatures than Pressurised Water Reactors, PWRs, that are currently in common use. The very high temperature, good for industrial uses as well as desalination and production of liquid fuels. At any time the Molten Salt can be removed from the reactor core into a safe holding tank without risk of meltdown. This can be done automatically before any risk of meltdown. It is walkaway safe. These reactors could run on Thorium that is 3 times more common than Uranium. It does not need enrichment and can use up almost all the nuclear fuel, leaving very little waste. Thorium is a byproduct of rare earth mining so it is easily available.The Traveling Wave Reactor, TWR, is self-contained and does not need refueling. It operates over a number of years on depleted Uranium waste which is already available in large amounts as low-grade nuclear waste. The Chinese TWR is based on a US design. It is hoped that this reactor will be very easy to operate and can be used in less developed countries. So it is designed to be simple and very safe to operate. When it eventually runs out of fuel it is replaced and returned to the factory where it is built for storage and recycling.Smaller and modular reactors could be produced more effectively and faster in a factory and transported to site. Able to fit in with existing infrastructure and transported to where it is needed. And used in countries that do not have advanced nuclear industries.Large scale production could be a vital option for low carbon energy and prototypes should be built. If they work as expected they could supply safe, cheap and clean power. With hundreds of years of fuel giving us the time to develop effective fusion energy.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

2,"We do not know, and it would be irresponsible. Fusion is a great idea but currently oversold. The problems of Tritium supply and Plasma Facing Material may be solved, but they are both major unsolved problems right now, and like the AGR cladding problem may make the proposed technology completely unsound.

3,"As others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperaturAs others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperatures and pressures that are needed for fusion to take place.But very, very slowly and inefficiently. How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",78 followers,Rajan Singh,8.3K,360,25.2M,https://www.quora.com/If-the-ITER-program-became-every-nation-on-Earths-first-priority-how-much-faster-if-at-all-could-we-use-fusion-as-a-reliable-source-of-energy-and-solve-our-problems

You are not seeking the best but theWithout clarity on that point your choices are highly theoretical and challenging and require significant research to determine how they might be used.Only one approach requires no research whatever only investment in development,This solves the problem of constant one gee boost for interplanetary travel since boosting from Earth to Pluto at one gee requires only 3% light speed whilst exhaust speeds of 11.9% light speed are achieved with Daladeus exhaust requiring only 22.2% propellant fractions for even these trips. Shorter trips use less propellantThat's because;We know how to make small hydrogen bombs.http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdfWe know what materials to choose to be Aneutronic to eliminate much of the shielding requirement.We know how to detonate pulse units without using atomic bombs as triggers.https://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:7ab2ff58-4bd9-4142-a016-845036a71fe7/233.pdfhttp://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/16/019/16019198.pdfWe know how to confine and direct the entire plasma wave without a heavy pusher plate. This radically increases thrust to weight while improving exhaust speed.It was the reason Daladeus selected this approach.Project Daedalus : Hoover, Thomas : Free Download & Streaming : Internet ArchiveProject Daedalus - Interstellar MissionThis requiresWithout these specific decisions we are left with highly speculative approaches that require significant research that could at any moment be classified out of existence.Without direct application of microfusion blasts in an electromagnetic thrust chamber the fusion rocket remains a theoretical and speculative designSince the design then relies on the development of fusion power technology beyond current capabilities, and requires the construction of rockets much larger and more complex than any current spacecraft.The surest way of building a fusion rocket with current technology is to use hydrogen bombs as proposed in Project Orion, but such a spacecraft would also be massive due to its pusher plate and of efficiency of energy coupling to the vehicle. Electromagnetic pulse and fission pollution make further problems.The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear bombs as propulsion. Therefore, the use of nuclear bombs to propel rockets on Earth is problematic, but possible in space in theory well beyond Earth.The answer here is to create micro fusion only pulse units and don't call them bombs. Also, you may use chemical rockets and solar power to operate well beyond Earth and establish an independent nuclear capacity beyond Earth. This runs up against the same sorts of barriers that keep critical information classified.FutureOnce space travel is solved then developElectricityWe will solve the energy problems of industry. Capturing $4 trillion per year in revenue.Designing an electromagnetic thrust chamber that directs the plasma of a series of microfusion blasts to produce thrust also makes a practical MHD generator using the same approach. In this way two or more chambers may be connected to produce significant Alternating current and very low exhaust velocity. Here we absorb the explosions on magnetic fields and tap the current off the containment vessels to drive your load.Ion rockets a non starter when joined with ICFIn theory you could use this to energize ion engines like vasimir but you will not obtain higher exhaust speeds as the plasma you started with or achieve the same thrust to weightLaserA new tool in addition to defense.Microfusion induced laser action is also possible by reconfiguring the plasma chamber to support laser action.Nuclear Pumped Gas LasersWhile much research is directed toward large lasers to create inertial confinement fusion success with an appropriate rocket program gives powerful fusion pumped lasers.These too are classified.https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk3/1984/8410/841005.PDFAdvanced material processingPowerful lasers break down rock and gas and liquids into plasma.
