A small reactor would still need to have the radiation shielding and the surface area to volume is not in your favor. The larger reactor means that the volume goes up as a cube of the radius while the surface area is only the square of the surface.

1,"Because the pressures and temperatures required for fusion are extremely difficult to produce. As a material heats up, it wants to expand, this stops fusion from happening. The center of a star has trillions of tonnes of mass squeezing it together, so it’s easily able to maintain the required conditions. A fusion reactor has to use other means to keep the reaction mass together (inertial or magnetic confinement), which is not easy to do.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor

3,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",45 followers,Brad Gunn,3.4K,1.5K,1.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor

9,"In the 1950’s, experiments at Princeton, Livermore, and Los Alamos showed that magnetic confinement of plasma had a problem of “instabilities”, in which the plasma, which is electrically charged, creates electric fields that can cause itself to drift out to the walls of the containment vessel.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

13,"Inertial Confinement D-D fusion isMankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike fission-fusion nuclear test that produced huge amounts of fusion energy from pure DeuInertial Confinement D-D fusion isMankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike fission-fusion nuclear test that produced huge amounts of fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away).Historically, this early method of producing more energy from nuclear fusion than it took to bring the fusion device to fusion conditions actually worked the very first time it was tried experimentally (Ivy -Mike nuclear test 1952) -ICF D-D fission-fusion technology historicallyand produced large industrially significant amounts of fusion energy in excess of the energy required to run the experiment from the very first experimental test.Today, pure fusion device technology derived from successful early fission-fusion designs that does not require a fission primary is possible and is a better candidate for peaceful, ultra-clean, commercial electrical energy production from fusion.How might a multi-stage ICF pure fusion device work?A laser irradiates a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere, which initiates D-T fusion ignition which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a slightly tapered cylindrical pressurized liquid deuterium-filled tube.The energy yield of such a multi-stage pure fusion device can be “tuned” for convenient yield over a wide range by increasing (or decreasing) the length of the liquid Deuterium filled cylinder.As compared to DT fusion, pure deuterium fusion has the advantage that a larger fraction of its energy is released in form of charged fusion products. In the DT reaction 80% of the energy released goes into fast neutrons, whereas in the DD reaction the fraction is only 34%. DD fusion therefore permits the transfor­mation of a larger portion of the energy released directly into electric energy by magnetohydrodynamic power conversion. Moreover, in case of DD fusion, the neutron energy is only 2.4 MeV, whereas in DT fusion it is 14 MeV. The much larger neutron energy in DT fusion increases the material problems resulting from neutron bombardment of structural parts in a DT fusion reactor.A multi-stage DT-DD pure fusion device would use the minimum amount of Tritium to get fusion started in the pure fusion primary while allowing the smallest feasible laser to be used to initiate fusion by using Tritium in the fusion primary which has the characteristic of reaching ignition at the least demanding combination of conditions (temperature, confinement time, and plasma pressure).Could nuclear fusion be sustainable?Deuterium fusion and its ultimate potential for worldwide sustainable energy generation -D-D Fusion Can Provide Clean Sustainable Power Longer than the Earth has Existed or the Sun will BurnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium.The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy.In the year 2018 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts of energy as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn)Nuclear fusion may not be considered by some as being renewable, as it depends on the fusion of Deuterium taken from the world's oceans which while very abundant, is limited. Fusion energy should however produce reliable, dispatchable power on demand longer than renewable wind and solar.The very earliest successful energy producing fusion reactors will probably use the first generation fusion reactions (DT and DD fusion). Over time, technical advance will allow second and third generation fusion fuels to be utilized for commercial power generation and powering transportation applications (ships, cars, planes, and even power tools) over the course of the next 200 years.The ultimate potential of D-D fusion is very very great.The original proposal for fusion in the earliest days of the fusion program (late 1940s and 1950s) was to produce power through the self-fusion of deuterium — the D-D reaction. This reaction produces with equal probability, either the light helium isotope with two protons and a neutron (He3) or the heaviest hydrogen isotope, tritium (T) with one proton and tow neutrons. Both reactions release energy, generally measured in millions of electron volts (MeV).D + D —> He3 + n + 3.2 MeVD + D —> T + p + 4.0 MeVThese reaction products can themselves react with deuterium and will either be “burned” in place or recycled.D + T —> He4 + n + 17.6 MeVD + He3 —> He4 + p + 18.3 MeVBecause the fuel for the last two reactions is generated in the ﬁrst two, only deuterium need be supplied externally. The ﬁnal reaction products — ordinary helium and hydrogen — are benign, but the energetic neutrons can damage and induce radioactivity in the structure of the reactor. This neutron activation of reactor structure is a manageable problem that nuclear engineers can reduce and minimize by using low neutron activation steels and materials in the fusion chamber. Further improvement in solving neutron damage and fusion chamber neutron activation problems can be obtained by employing a neutronically thick falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorbent that absorbs fusion neutrons before they damage reactor structure and also safely carries away heat from the fusion reaction.Additional practical considerationsThere are reasons to believe that ICF laser fusion power plants will be stable and reliable sources of power right from the first days of operation while early complex MCF fusion power plants will struggle to produce reliable power and will actually produce energy for early decades in short, unpredictable, bursts of under a minute or so before the plasma goes unstable and the MCF power plant has to be shut down.It is considerably easier to create and then sustain fusion conditions for sub-gram samples of fusion fuel for a few nanoseconds in laser Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment than it is to stably maintain intense precise magnetic fields forming a stable plasma bottle or trap for indefinite amounts of time in Magnetic Confinement Fusion tokamak and stellarator devices.While MCF fusion devices are frequently described and marketed to the public as nice stable continuous fusion plasma burning energy producing devices, the truth is that such stable energy production has never yet been achieved even once for more than a second or two at significant power levels in more than sixty years of hard research effort The current record for MCF pure fusion power generation was demonstrated using the JET tokamak in 1997 while burning DT fuel where JET produced something close to beak-even power for a bit less than a second - producing about three quarters the fusion energy as output as the electrical energy that was drawn from the local power grid to bring fusion plasma to fusion conditions. The facts are that to date all MCF fusion experiments have produced short irregular and unpredictable amounts of power in short unpredictable spits and spurts - usually of less than a second length before the plasma goes unstable and the run in the experimental MCF fusion device must be shut down.It is considerably easier to do something hard like creating and then sustaining fusion conditions in DT or DD fusion plasma for nanoseconds than it is to continuously maintain fusion conditions in MCF fusion devices continuously and indefinitely.As a result, small ICF based fusion power plants will tend to be safe, stable, and reliable power generators right from the beginning once they are commercially introduced while complex, large Magnetic Confinement Fusion devices like tokamaks and stellarators will struggle to produce fusion energy in irregular, unpredictable spurts of power for at least the first couple of decades of operation of first generation MCF fusion power plants.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,508,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-will-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-look-like

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-will-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-look-like

And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER.

The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower.

Tokamaks, including the smaller spherical tokamaks by Tokamak energy, are sold to the public as continuous power generators while in fact only produce power in spurts of less than a couple of hundreds seconds at a time. This is because a transformer in the power supply is used to produce the huge currents in the plasma required to reach and then maintain fusion conditions This fact is not adequately explained by tokamak advocates (and these facts are typically not passed along by fusion professionals to the public leaving large portions of the public misinformed - believing that tokamak reactors produce smooth continuous power when this is far from being the case).Hundreds of Tokamaks, Stellarators, and other magnetic fusion designs have been built over the last 60 years and hundreds of thousands of shots have been made with these machines without a single instance of net power being demonstrated.Inertial Confinement Fusion is frequently criticized with public support withheld because ICF produces energy in a series of short controlled fusion bursts. People like smooth power, not short repeated bursts of power. This preference for magentic confinement fusion projects among decision makers and the public is based however on misinformation that for decades has been carefully passed as misinformation. Tokamaks, including the ITER tokamak and the ST 40 by Tokamak Energy, do not produce continuous power but rather produce somewhat irregular releases of power no longer than a few hundred seconds in duration at a time due to limitations in the Tokamak power supply that require use of high current transformers to produce the huge currents required in tokamak plasma current.Note: The record for tokamak fusion power generation is about 5 seconds while producing significant amounts of power (JET tokamak - 1996).Fission ignited Inertial Confinement Fusion worked the very first time it was tried (Ivy-Mike test) demonstrating fusion power generation with energy gain (fusion gain factor Qe=>100,000) and has never since failed to work.I think that if the object is to introduce a practical form of fusion in the least amount of time (10 years or less to commercial versions) - then it is better to adapt fission-fusion technology that worked the first time it was tried (and never failed) to be pure fusion rather than continue to try to improve magnetic confinement fusion devices that have never worked and never once produced net energy even once in sixty long years of devoted efforts.Fission-fusion is not unicorns, science fiction, or BS.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away).Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). In the final few years on underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays generated in the primary of an experimental fission device.During the last decade of the cold war, ICF fusion was experimentally PROVEN to work by both LANL and LLNL field test divisions. If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is NO QUESTION that full pure fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved.NY Times article published at the time of the once classified Halite-Centurion field tests -","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor
