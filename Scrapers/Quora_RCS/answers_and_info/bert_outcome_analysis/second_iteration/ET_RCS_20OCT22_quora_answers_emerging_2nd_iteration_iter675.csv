1,"I believe that the “Bussard Ramjet” is technologically feasible. That’s the idea that a spaceship could maintain acelleration constantly by “scooping up” combustible interstellar hydrogen using a huge scoop… A force-field.The idea was that the ship could acellerate continuously towards it’s goal without requiring on-board fuel, then turn around at the halfway point (and reverse the force field) to decelerate/brake for the second half of the journey so as not to overshoot.Very high fractions of lightspeed could conceivably be attained by constant 1-G acelleration.",0 followers,Tamara M,2.1K,101,14.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

The sail is designed to receive the beam, which can accelerate away from the Sun as well as decelerate upon nearing its target star system.Mr. Forward provided terrific design plans for his fictional starship.

Shockingly, they lived together out of wedlock and she was ostracized by society.In Switzerland, she was a guest of Lord Byron’s and on one gloomy, rainy day, Lord Byron proposed a challenge to his bored guests: everyone would write a ghost story and they would all decide the winner.While the men quickly lost interest in the project, Mary created Frankenstein, a work that would change the face of English literature.I know there is going to be a bit of backlash on this answer so here’s a quote by Isaac Asimov, a prolific writer who popularized the science fiction genre.“Mary Shelley was the first to make use of a new finding of science which she advanced further to a logical extreme, and it is that which makes",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,12.8K,314,7.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

No doubt these guys would fail miserably if they rush to save Fire Lord Ozai.Thor is basically a human at peak physical condition, even more so than Captain America, as a depowered god. Wipes out other other physical condition humans without a sweat. Sure he’s 1500 years old, so I guess he wasn’t the best example, but I couldn’t think of anyone else.Never mind, here’s a great example. I don’t recall this guy taking combat classes in his first movie before the super serum. After super serum, he’s taking down a battalion like he’s done it his whole life.Next door neighbor girl isn’t the most beautiful yet a kind person the male protagonist doesn’t like romantically at first, but they look like this:Or thisShy next door neighborhood girl is supposedly unattractive yet they cast a beautiful woman with incredible bone structure who can easily pass as a supermodel or celebrity. Bonus: she doesn’t even know that she’s beautiful or doesn’t put much effort in her appearance yet you can tell by her perfectly manicured hands or carefully tousled hairstyle that says otherwise. According to movies, she’s not “beautiful” or anyone’s top list simply because she keeps to herself.Take off your glasses and style your hair, and suddenly you’re the most attractive person ever clicheFrom dorky sweet and introverted journalistTo super hunk with massive muscles.From unpopular dorky girl with glassesTo beloved royal beauty with no glasses.Female assassin who was orphaned at a younger age, grew up on the streets, tormented or scorned.All of these women had bad handouts in life so they had to toughen up. Yet every “hardened” female killer you see in movies, tv shows or video games have the same sad backgrounds in different phrases as if you have to have a shitty life to become a trained killer. Movies don’t stray from this. Some people don’t have shitty lives yet still killed people in their lives just because they can.Tiny slender woman beat down a whole group of buff dudes effortlessly while looking like a model doing so.Let’s be honest, men can easily overpower women. Yet you see 110–120 pound actresses beat down 10+ guys who are physically fit without messing up their hair or hardly getting scratches. When I was sparring with guys, they were holding back to avoid severely injuring me because one full power punch or kick would end me.The useless military and police clicheAlmost every movie that show the military or police force make them look like total idiots with high tech and guns. While in real life (there are some idiots in the police and military ranks) when it comes to dangerous situations they generally aren’t panicking or clueless. Similar to my useless guards, they are shown to be overpowered easily. Also, they’re shown to be unnecessarily aggressive or clueless as if they can’t think for themselves or why should they listen to the protagonist as they’re in a bloody war zone.For example, when Captain America was ordering the police to protect civilians at a certain location, the leader automatically retorted why should he listen to him. Um hello? Aliens are invading and terrorizing civilians, civilians you should be protecting instead of just pandering around. Only after Cap beats up a bunch of aliens in front of him is when he finally orders his men to do what Cap ordered him to do so.Either movies vastly underestimate how powerful and effective military weapons and air strikes are or they purposefully depower them when it comes to the military combating aliens or zombies, rendering their weapons almost useless.While we don’t know how advanced aliens would be in real life, it shouldn’t be that easy to wipe out the whole military force on Earth. Who knows, maybe it is.If there’s one thing all governments don’t fail to do unanimously, they spend a lot of money, time and effort into weapons of mass destruction. With the modern age evolving, it’s only natural for weapons to evolve as well and the more technology advances, so will our weapons. Those same weapons should have no problems wiping out walking flesh bags (zombies) and the world shouldn’t become an zombie apocalypse due to the military constantly evolving and scanning for threats.The government is pretty good at keeping things contained and hushed. If there was a zombie outbreak from their lab, it was probably most likely neutralized already and we didn’t even know it. Movies portray the military as inadequate to keep things contained and being virtually powerless or too late to stop them despite their arsenal while we know in real life it would be the opposite.",339 followers,Alex Robinson,2K,825,21.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

Just in time to give her a haircut to cover up the emotional reconnection. The whole room leaves them alone for one magical haircut. Come on people.

It jolts you out of suspension of disbelief. It breaks that fourth wall “There’s the writer trying too hard!”Later on after winning the match Billie is ecstatic, she’s overwhelmed by the crowd, the interviews and she has an interview coming up with a famous news caster in a few seconds and then…What do you know, she ditches the whole thing to have a good cry in the abandoned bowels of the stadium. Yep, nobody there but her and her tears. Did that scene need to be shoved in there? If it had happened in real life then please at least try to make it a bit more realistic. And then when she comes out nobody even notices her, Billie Jean King, the woman who just won the battle of the sexes, the woman people all came to see and was hyped up on television for weeks…nope, nobody but her costumer notices her, and he gives her some life coaching advice about how love of every kind will be accepted one day.Wonderful advice. Why oh why did they pile on all that other unbelievable crap on top of it? And let’s make Bobby Riggs look like he’s pouting his way off the court and sneaking out of the stadium! What a loser! Right?Yeah, didn’t happen.I can see the producer now: “We gotta add a scene in there where she breaks down, people love it. The adversary has to be broken and act like a petulant child! Yeah, that will make her victory even better. We have to add a scene in there where she gets some good solid uplifting words from an admirable gay man who’s seen it all! The gays’ll eat it up!

There are some oohs and aahs, a frenzy of fussing and photographs, and a bittersweet sense of awe that this little girl, who was only just yesterday wearing pigtails and band-aids over scraped knees, is now a beautiful, accomplished young woman. The doorbell rings, and a young man comes inside, nervously clutching a corsage. He makes eye contact with his date’s father, and the atmosphere rapidly shifts from one of joyous anticipation to a tense fog. The father accosts the boy, even making physical threats, while the mother smiles uncomfortably, attempting to simultaneously restrain her husband and put the boy at ease. The young couple finally make their way out, and the mother is embarrassed by the father’s behavior, but the father insists that he wasn’t overreacting — he knows how boys think, and he was just being protective.Let’s pause for a moment. What exactly is this hypothetical father attempting to protect his daughterAs a daughter, I’ve always found the trope of the overprotective father to be unsettling, even creepy. The term ‘patriarchy’ has been diluted to the extent that it’s more often a punchline than a meaningful descriptor, but I think it applies here. There’s a strong element of ownership to the dynamic, a sort of preemptive damage control to ensure the protection of one’s property.It stems from misinformation and hysteria surrounding sexuality, particularly female sexuality. Sex is viewed as something a man “gets” from a woman, instead a mutually pleasurable activity that two (or more) people decide to engage in. Men are the pursuers; women are the gatekeepers. Men are sex-crazed brutes who have to manipulate women into having sex under the guise of emotional intimacy; women are delicate flowers who have to be coaxed and cajoled into having sex, because they don’t have desires or libidos of their own. Male virginity is shameful, something to be rid of. Female virginity is a mark of “honor” and “purity”, something to take pride in.The notion of sexually experienced women as ‘damaged goods’ has yet to be eradicated, because there was a time when womenWhy is this trope sexist? Because at best, it infantilizes young women, and at worst, denies them agency over their own bodies and desires. By insisting that they “know how boys think”, parents demonstrate a profound lack of understanding about their daughters, and human nature itself. Young women are sexual beings, just like their male counterparts. It’s a painful truth for many to swallow, because it runs contrary to the cultural fetishism of femininity as untainted by the base and corrupt masculine (see, benevolent sexism). It also sends a confusing and damaging message to young men, that attraction and respect are mutually exclusive (see, Madonna-whore complex).Ultimately, young women do not need to be “protected” from consensual sexual encounters. What young people need is comprehensive, non-judgmental education— not just about contraception and STD’s and assault, but honest discussions about sexuality, intimacy, and what constitutes a healthy relationship. Above all, young people, particularly women, need to know that their feelings and desires are not shameful, and if all involved parties consent, neither is acting on them.","28,084 followers",Murphy Barrett,2.4K,12.3K,156.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-clich%C3%A9s-and-tropes-in-movies-that-you-are-tired-of-seeing

Apparently she had phoned in sick and did not expect to return for a few days. She was a lovely lady but we were not particularly close emotionally or professionally. I began my day in the usual way, but couldn’t stop thinking about her and some of the short conversations Tammy (not her real name) and I previously had when we casually met in the kitchen or bathroom or wherever. As I tried to concentrate on my work, things started to feel a little “off”. But why? Everybody is entitled to take some sick time, and it was rare for Tammy not to come in. Thoughts of planning my day vanished as I started to feel a sense of urgency. I phoned her. No answer. At that point I felt an overwhelming desire to pay her a visit. The Personnel Dept had her address and, reluctantly gave it to me, sensing my unusual insistence that I HAD to see her, even without a valid reason.Arriving at her home, it appeared that no one was home. The blinds were pulled shut and it was eerily quiet. There was no answer to my loud and insistent knocking. More alarm bells, but logic told me that she was probably at the doctors office. The sense of impending doom overrode my logic as I raced around the back of her home. I found a sliding door that was locked, but leaving a very small opening. I learned later that it was just wide enough for her large cat to use but not large enough for anyone else to enter. I, however, was small enough to squeeze through with a great amount of effort, so I did. Nobody downstairs. I literally run upstairs with my heart pounding by this stage. There she was. In bed and unconscious. But alive - just. The ambulance I phoned for arrived within minutes.Tammy had tried to commit suicide and had gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure the desired outcome. Another few minutes and she would have succeeded. She was admitted to a facility appropriate to her needs and remained there for several months.I did not keep in touch with Tammy, especially after she made it very clear to me that my interference was not wanted and, at the time, she really did want to die. I somehow “know” that she is now grateful for her life and is doing the remarkable things she was always meant to do. I believe we all have a purpose in this life and that her experience, although probably negative at the time, has allowed her to become a blessing to others and a positive motivation for people who find themselves in her situation.For me, I continue to listen to that small inner voice. Is it intuition or coincidence? I believe it is the Universe, God or a higher power that is willing to guide me, and everybody willing to hear, along our path in this life. I’m learning to trust more and more as I walk through this fascinating story we call our life.After thought: I have had a couple of comments that have prompted me to add a post script, below. This is a copied response to a much appreciated reader.“Hi Mors, thank you for your response. I felt it important to let you know that Tammy completely recovered, mentally and physically. I was so grateful to hear from a mutual acquaintance some time later that she did eventually realise that she had two boys and a fiancé who loved her dearly, as she loved them, and did in fact “live happily ever after”. However, I totally respect your views. I too would like to have a choice when or if the time comes and it is appropriate. My mother had a DNR (do not resuscitate) document in place when she died and it was followed. I believe every one of us has free will, but on this occasion Tammy’s decision was “temporary” due to circumstances. Had that not been so, I do not believe the Universe would have sent me on such an urgent mission.”",84 followers,Gaye Bockman,1.3K,76,171.5K,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

I passed my house and drove straight to the police station, with the car still behind me. Only when I pulled into the police station parking lot, did the car speed away. I waited in the police parking lot for 5 minutes, watching for them to come back, but they didn’t. I drove to my house and sat inside with my dog in the dark, watching for them to come back but they were gone.This was before cell phones were a thing.

She really would have been my ideal caregiver.Daycare 2, the caregiver seemed nice but her childcare area which was on the split level of her house looked bare, red flag 1. The carpet was extremely worn down. She claimed that she doesn't have any kids under her care now since they all started school…all of them? Red flag 2. She also claimed that she had a daycare in another town nearby but decided to close that one, red flag 3. I just had a bad feeling & decided to keep looking. She later called me to see if I was still interested & I told her that her carpet was dirty...lol. She got upset but that's the first thing lame excuse that popped into my head.Daycare 3, the caregiver was friendly, lots of toys & kid friendly furniture in her garden room which was setup for childcare. References checked out. She was a widow who raised 5 kids on her own, her older daughter sometimes helped her. She was my babysitter until my daughter went to school & I still occasionally talk to her. She would confide in me all her family problems & I helped her with minor things usually technology related or getting references for handyman etc.Well about my instinct, I was talking to my babysitter about daycare 2 & she happened to know that lady as they were from the same ethnicity, same religion, same business & lived 2 streets away. My babysitter said that daycare 2 used to operate in another town just as that lady indicated & had to close it due to 2 children being injured/died in her care. Daycare2 did not disclose that pertinent information during my interview. Allegedly one baby died from SIDS during nap time & the “caregiver “ didn't check on the baby for hours. The 2nd incident was when a little boy fell down from a short wall during outdoor play & later died in the hospital from his injuries. I don't know how she can still operate a daycare but I'm glad I didn't go with daycare 2.

Also the order was already paid online so at first I wasn’t overly excited about it because in cash payment orders usually They tip us a couple of dollars or so… So yeah I’m just here tryna deliver but I actually over heard one of the guys saying “the bloke is working hard, give him something” that’s when I realised I was gonna get tipped big! So the delivery took about 15–20 mins coz I had walk back and forth to my car and the house. So then after the last round of delivering like 4 pizzas I was told to wait! There were about 6 families there with 16 adults and all very friendly! Everybody came up to me and tipped me $5 each, what a crazy night… was over the moon and took home $265 including my 5 hour shift!! Inc.

34,"My daughter (13 at the time) was invited to spend the day with a school friend. I asked as I always did were there going to be any parental supervision and who else would be at home. We had recently moved to a new town so didn’t know her friends and their families, where we had lived we knew everyone; so this was also a way to get to know her friends parents.We were told her dad would be home and a younger brother. OK, in fact DAD worked with hubby so that should be fine.Dropped daughter off and no cars in the drive. Where is dad? Oh, he ran to the store for a moment.

At neighbors taking care of pets while they are away. OK, I’ll be back in 2 hours to pick daughter up . . NO! We will call you when to pick up (this from the friend she is visiting). Hmm, well ok but I will call in a bit to talk with dad and make sure that is OK with him. NO I’ll have him call you.I left and got most of the way home but was feeling disquiet. Daughter’s friend seemed jumpy, daughter seemed bewildered as if she was questioning the change in plans and friends reaction to my questions. NOTE: After the move we had long discussion about the need to meet parents and know where she would be in a new town. At this time she did not have a cell phone and knew few people in the new town.I turned the car around and went back to the friends house (about 10 minutes after having left) and saw an old junker in the drive. I was a bit surprised as the dad had a great job and hubby said he was the type of guy that got new cars frequently. I knocked on the door and a young man answered the door. He looked nothing like the friend. My daughter jumped up and came to the door immediately pulling me out the door. Right then, the friend came running from the back of the house closely followed by a much older boy.I asked which boy was her brother and they both stammered. I asked if “dad” was back from the grocery yet, again fish face and no answer. Daughter said we should leave. I said we will but I wanted to know what was going on first.It seemed “friend” wanted to hang out with her much older (18 years old) boyfriend but he had a friend with him that day. Daughter’s friend decided to invite her for the day to keep boyfriends friend busy while she entertained her boyfriend in her room. Brother was not home, Dad was not home. I told daughter’s friend that the boys needed to leave and that I would be calling her parents.She said that she would have dad call me. He did and was FINE with his daughter and her much older boyfriend. My husband was not happy with our daughter being put in that situation and of course he forbade her from being around that friend. Friend’s dad felt that was wrong and had the nerve to speak to hubby at work. It did cause a conflict!Things were said and some of them very rude about my daughter and myself. HR got involved too!I also decided to give MOM a call. Turns out it was NOT OK with her for her 13 year old daughter to be in her bedroom with an 18 year old. Dad was trying to arrange an early marriage for daughter and didn’t want her to continue her education, become “liberated and unruly”.Daughter admitted that she hadn’t known what friend had in mind but had said she had invited friends over and it would be “Fun”. Daughter had expected to see other girls come over to hang out. The friend was planning on having sex and had promised her boyfriend that her friend would entertain his friend in a similar way!She was debating walking home but was too afraid they would come after her, and too afraid to call (plus knew I wouldn’t be home yet).",0 followers,The Last Roman,6.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-clich%C3%A9s-and-tropes-in-movies-that-you-are-tired-of-seeing

He handed me the phone to call. I wasn’t sure what to say. “Just call. You’ll figure it out”, he responded.The overwhelming feeling that something was very wrong wouldn’t let up. I called our daughter. She laughed and said everything was fine. I asked her to humor me and just go check. She said kids were asleep, so I asked her to go check the kitchen. Still chuckling at me she checked the stove and oven and declared them turned off. She looked about the rest of the kitchen until she turned in the direction facing the front doors. We have a large arctic entry so there are two front doors on each side of it so we come in from the cold and close one door and then open the second door to come to the house.“Oh my God!” She cried out, and the phone went dead. I frantically tried calling back.When she finally answered again, she told me both doors were wide open, so she called her Marine brother to come down from the upstairs apartment and he raced down. He did a security sweep of the house then the perimeter where he found evidence of bear on each side of the house. We question if the door was slightly ajar and the bear just pushed the doors open and started to come into the house until the phone rang.That same mom vibe served me well when my Marines were deployed. I always seemed to know when to pray. It got to the point that whenever there was an incident, my other Marine son said he wouldn’t worry. Even when trapped in a doorway during a fire fight for five hours… because he knew his mom “knew” and was praying. Oddly enough, he was right.

36,"This is one memory that still sends shivers down my spine.When I was in Grade 6, I used to go out and cycle around the park with few of my friends (3 guys. I am a girl.). There was this shady neighborhood near the park. All parents have warned us to never go near that place.So one day, while playing in the park, we hear the police and ambulance sirens from the neighborhood and we rush to the side of the park from where we can see a part of the neighborhood. We were scared to go and check, so we went back to play. The next day, we came to know that someone was murdered in the neighborhood and hThis is one memory that still sends shivers down my spine.When I was in Grade 6, I used to go out and cycle around the park with few of my friends (3 guys. I am a girl.). There was this shady neighborhood near the park. All parents have warned us to never go near that place.So one day, while playing in the park, we hear the police and ambulance sirens from the neighborhood and we rush to the side of the park from where we can see a part of the neighborhood. We were scared to go and check, so we went back to play. The next day, we came to know that someone was murdered in the neighborhood and his body was dumped in one of the empty broken down buildings there.Our curiosity spiked and we decide we should go and investigate the building where the police found the body. Yes, I know this was the stupidest idea ever but at that age we used to read a lot of mystery stories and we were very excited and hoped to solve the crime on our own (rolling eyes at my own stupidity).So yes, we gather all the courage our little hearts could handle and cycle to this building. When we reached there, my courage drained out but I didn’t want to show it out as those guys would make fun of me saying it’s because I am a girl. So I came up with a brilliant idea (Probably the reason I am still alive). I told them I would take care of their cycles, while they go inside and investigate. It wasn’t a familiar place, what if someone stole our bicycles? How would we go back? The guys agreed to it and they went inside. Within a few seconds, I started feeling uneasy I wasn’t sure what it was. I felt as if I was being watched. I looked around and didn’t find anyone but my heart and head were screaming that there’s something wrong. I tried to calm myself down but I couldn’t. So I just sat there praying these guys would back soon and we could finally leave this place. After, I think, around 5 minutes, something inside me told me to turn around and check. I was scared so I didn’t turn at first. But then feeling started becoming stronger, the voice in me was begging me to turn around. So I turned. I noticed a guy crossing the road from the other end and coming towards. He was not taking his eyes off me and was smiling at me in a very creepy way. I sensed danger and instantly my adrenaline kicked in and told me to leave the place as soon as possible. So I step on my cycle pedal and start to cycle as fast as my legs could. When I reached the end of the road, I stopped and turned back. He was there. He was running as fast as he could and waving at me to stop. I just rushed out of the neighborhood, to the park. I took a moment to catch my breathe and then rushed home. I sat on the stairs in my building because I was shivering from head to toe and I didn’t want my parents to know about this. So after I calmed down, I went home and tried to push this incident away from my head but it just wouldn’t go away. Next day, I pretended to be sick so that I wouldn’t have to leave the safety of my home and go out. The next day, I felt a little better, so I went out to cycle around the park. My friends teased me mercilessly that day. But I didn’t care, I was just glad that I didn’t stay.Fast forward a few months, when I woke up I saw my parents in front of the TV, watching news with a worried look on their face. I looked up at the TV and I froze. I could feel every cell in my body turning cold. It was breaking news and there was this guy’s picture. The guy who ran behind me. He was arrested by the police for kidnapping and raping young girls violently. After he used them completely, he used to sell them to human and organ traffickers. The police couldn’t yet confirm how many girls this monster had raped.I started crying My parents thought it was because I saw such a horrific news, so they immediately turned off the TV. But inside I was thanking God for saving my life. For forcing me to turn around and look.I have always listened to intuition after that and it has helped me in many ways. So guys, yes, I think we have a sixth sense. There is something inside us that warns us when there is danger. Please listen to that little voice inside you and nothing will go wrong because only we know what is the best for us.",UNKNOWN,Jess H.
