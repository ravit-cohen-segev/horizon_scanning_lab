Its ability to scale; however, has been a central issue of debate. Many novel innovations have come into existence that offer interesting solutions, to name a few,One new solution that piques my interest isThis data storage method allows low-power devices to fully participate in the temtum network and confirm transactions without requiring the resources demanded by traditional proof-of-work blockchain networks such as Bitcoin. The combination of the temtum Consensus Algorithm and Temporal technology allows the temtum network to deliver extremely high transaction throughput and short transaction confirmation times with low resource requirements.They have used laboratory tests followed by a live deployment over globally distributed servers to confirm a throughput of up to 120,000 transactions per second (a multiple of the peak capacity of 56,000 TPS on the VISA network).[2]The technology behind temtum is already fully developed, including mobile and web applications, (which are described below). It is already a fully operational form of payment and has already secured Govt contracts. Temtum is also being developed by one of the strongest teams in the Blockchain industry. Here is some more info;- Developed by Dragon Infosec:- Has a live mainnet :https://explorer.temtum.com/- PhD / peer reviewed tech- Contracts with Anguilla and Zimbwawe for their currency - lots of others coming- Private funded - no ICO / IEO - never asked anyone for cash - its all their own- Totally feelessThe NIST Randomness Beacon is novel to temtum, and is a source of truly random numbers that broadcasts full-entropy bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds, providing three key functions: unpredictability, autonomy and consistency. The unpredictable nature of the NIST Randomness Beacon makes it impossible for any user to predict the bits it generates before they are published by the source. All users accessing the source of the beacon can be confident that they all receive an identical random string, while the beacon remains highly resistant to malicious interference by external parties. The key features of the NIST Randomness Beacon include:- Generated numbers that cannot be predicted before they are published–even by future quantum computing techniques.- The public,time-bound and authenticated nature ofthe NIST Randomness Beacon allows any user application to prove that it used truly random numbers not known before a specific point in time.- Proof of random number generation can be validated offline at any point subsequent to generation. Based on these properties,the NIST beacon has been chosen as a source of randomness for the Temporal network.",639 followers,Said Nusir,572,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Did-Elon-Musk-start-a-cryptocurrency

It looks too good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don’t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won’t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.PS: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing so that you could gain one or two things as this has been working for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.1It Will Be the Main Currency in the FutureOne thing that the economic crisis of 2008 showed us is that traditional banking systems are flawed. And it’s been confirmed in 2020. More and more people are seeing the need for viable alternatives. And that’s exactly what crypto offers — a secure, decentralized form of banking, that takes governments and banks out of the equation.And the crazy thing is, that even banks realize it. Just listen to what Germany’s Deutsche Bank have to say. In their ‘Imagine 2030’ report, they talk about how fragile the traditional money system is — that by 2030, over 200 million people will be using digital money — and by then, traditional money will already be on the way out.And it’s not just Deutsche Bank. Twitter’s Jack Dorsey has said he believes Bitcoin will eventually become the world’s single currency. Elon Musk has stated that ‘crypto is a far better way to transfer value than a piece of paper.’ China State TV has called Blockchain — the technology that makes crypto possible — 10 times more valuable than the internet.2You Need to Get Familiarized With the TechnologyIt’s the biggest technological invention since the internet. So, if you ‘re still not up to speed with it, you’re behind. But the good news is, you’re still in time to start playing catch-up.Just like in the 90s, when the internet was taking off, there were those who resisted adapting to it. There will be those people with the blockchain and crypto revolution — but do you really want to be one of them?And just like we now rely on the internet for information and communications — soon it’s going to be the same for financial transactions using blockchain. So if you’re not familiar with using it yet now’s the time — what are you waiting for?3You will position yourself better for opportunities in this spaceSure, you can make and receive payments with a crypto account. You can use it to save. But the really big opportunities come with investing in crypto.Just take a look at Bitcoin. If you’d invested $100 in it just 5 years ago, by now that $100 would be worth $2 500. Or if you’d got in really early with that $100 ten years ago, be worth $1.9 million.The price of Bitcoin is still set to keep on going up. Sure, with blips here and there. And to be fair, probably not as dramatically as it did before. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple and Lisk also have huge potential to grow, and bring great returns to savvy investors.But to know which coins to invest in, and when you do need to get educated — and get some experience under your belt. So why waste any time? Now’s the time to get crypto-savvy and learn to spot the opportunities — because you can be sure, there are huge opportunities waiting.4It’s a Solid Alternative for Saving Your MoneyWe’ve already talked about crypto’s long-term upwards trend. Let’s compare that with regular money. If you took $100 in cash, buried it, and waited 10 years, the amount you could buy with it a decade later could be a lot less than when you put it in the ground. Because of inflation. And leaving it in a bank account isn’t going to be much better — if at all. Because of the interest rates in bank accounts, which vary from zero to extremely low.Disclaimer — yes, crypto is more volatile than most currencies, largely because it’s still new, and gaining traction. Like at the start of 2018 when the price of Bitcoin tanked. Remember, it’s more or less recovered since then. And it’s upward trend is likely to continue, and win out on any volatility. And that’s what makes it such a great option for long-term saving — something that will beat any interest rated banks can give you.5You Are Safe From InflationSo, we were just talking about inflation. Let’s spell that out in full. The problem with traditional money is that it’s always going down in value. And this isn’t by accident. Governments and central banks do it on purpose. Especially when there’s a financial crisis. Like the one in 2008, or the one this year, in 2020.At times like these, there’s a shortage of money. And governments try to get around it by just printing more. In fact, 22% of all dollars that exist today were created in 2020, when the Federal Reserve injected $2 trillion into the economy.Making money appear out of thin air, might sound pretty neat. Until you figure out the catch. There may be more money — but the amount of goods and services it’s chasing stays the same. And the value of money goes down compared with the value of those goods and services. And that’s what we call inflation.That’s why smart people trust gold more than money. Because when there’s an economic crisis, new gold doesn’t just magically appear out of nowhere. And it holds its value. And Bitcoin and other crypto — just like gold — don’t get created as a short-term fix to financial problems. That means it crypto also holds its value. And it’s inflation-proof.6It’s Way Easier to Get Into Crypto Than You ThoughtJust in case you thought you need a PhD in programming, or maybe in finance to get into crypto — we’ll tell you now. You don’t. A smartphone with internet access will do nicely. In fact, crypto is way easier to get into than more traditional investments.First, because it’s got high liquidity — that you can buy and sell it easily and quickly. Second, there isn’t a high threshold to getting into it. For stocks and bonds, usually you need to put a large sum of money, and you can’t just put down 100 bucks. With crypto, you can.Better still, there are no institutions, no paperwork — just get an account, get a wallet, track your assets. And it’s pseudonymous — you don’t have to give any documents, or even your name.But we realize, there’s still a lot of confusion, and not many people understand how this space works, and how to take advantage of it. That’s why we decided to create the best course out there, to guide you step by step through everything we’ve learned about Bitcoin and Blockchain — from scratch.It’s called Bitcoin Essentials. You’ll learn how the technology works, how to use it, how to buy bitcoin safely, and how to store it. Just to go7No One Controls Your MoneySo if regular money is controlled by governments and banks — who does control crypto? Well, the beauty of crypto is that it’s controlled by nobody — and everybody — at the same time.Let’s take Bitcoin. The code is stored in thousands of nodes — that means the computers of tens of thousands people who voluntarily run Bitcoin software on their computers. There’s no central authority or mastermind behind it. All users effectively retain control. And it’s in everyone’s interests to keep the network active and healthy.And running it this way has all kinds of advantages over banks. Like, banks are only open business hours of the country they’re based in. Blockchain functions non-stop. And banks payments can take up to 48 hours to clear — Bitcoin transactions take between 15 minutes and an hour.8The Best Security on the MarketSo, if there’s no big powerful institution monitoring it, is it safe? The answer is a definite yes. It’s got the best security out there. And that’s down to the way information is stored.Any time a transaction takes place, and digital money gets handed over to a new user, that gets recorded permanently. And it can’t be erased. Even after it’s changed hands again. And remember we said that the data is stored by tens of thousands users? Unlike a bank, which has one central database.If one user has an error — or if anyone tries to tamper with information — the other tens of thousands will cross-reference each other and correct it. And the bigger the network — the more secure. And in the case of Bitcoin — that’s big. And you can count on it being secure.9The Lowest Fees by FarFor any kind of investment you make, there are going to be fees. Fees for making buying, selling and even storing the investment. And this is also true of crypto. But the difference is that with crypto, fees that are determined by users. And that means it’s in their interest to keep them low. Much lower than the ones you’ll be charged by stockbrokers to invest in stocks or bonds.And the same goes for making transfers — especially international ones. Make a transfer through a bank, and you’re going to get slapped by a high fee. But with crypto, there are no institutions making a profit from these money transfers, which is a huge advantage for people doing business. And another reason why the adoption rate of crypto is going to keep going up.10Blockchain Is Here to StayWhat you have to understand about blockchain, is that Bitcoin and other crypto, are built on Blockchain in the same way Facebook or Google are built on top of the internet. It’s what makes crypto possible — but there’s more to blockchain than crypto.We think that crypto is proof enough that blockchain is going to become more important. But just in case you needed more — let’s just look at all the other things blockchain is being used for.Big business is using it to record data. Companies like Pfizer, Walmart, Siemens, Unilever use it to keep data which is too complex for a spreadsheet to record. Healthcare providers use it to store their patients’ medical records safely. And there’s potential for it to grow in records of property ownership. And in elections, to keep track of votes and take away the need for recounts. Yep, that one would have come in handy in 2020.11High Returns if Done RightWe’ve already told you how much Bitcoin’s gone up — and how the long-term trend is bound to continue upwards. So we won’t repeat ourselves. But we will take the chance to tell you about a few other cryptocurrencies.In 2020, even with the pandemic in full swing, lots of crypto have seen big gains. The world’s second largest crypto, Ethereum started the year at $145, and is now at $600. And some are tipping it to become as popular as Bitcoin.And Ripple started the year at just over 20 cents and is now around 65 cents. And may others are headed in the same direction. Further proof, that now’s the time to get in the door, if you haven’t already.12It’s in Limited Supply — and Can’t Suffer From InflationRemember we talked about the way conventional currencies lose their value because of inflation? There’s a simple reason why crypto doesn’t.The supply is capped. This is written into the source code, which states that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin produced.Currently, 18.5 million Bitcoins have been mined. Quick explanation — mining means when advanced computers crack complex math problems and unlock the Bitcoins stored in the code.And even if new Bitcoins are still getting mined, there’s a limit on this. Unlike with traditional money, when banks decide print it by the truckload. With Bitcoin, the number of new coins released slows down every four years, meaning the supply is limited. And that’s the reason Bitcoin won’t suffer from inflation.13The Price Is Dictated by the Free Market, No Government Can Touch ItWith traditional money, governments have lots of options for manipulating its value. We already mentioned printing new money. As well as that, they set interest rates — the price of borrowing government money, which has ripple effect on the rest of the economy.But with crypto, none of this is set by a government. Instead everything’s controlled by the free market — or how much people are willing to buy or sell it for. And besides that, governments can’t freeze crypto accounts, or look at records of who has how much in crypto accounts. That’s because, unlike regular bank accounts, crypto accounts are pseudonymous. That means the holder doesn’t disclose their true name or identity.14It’s at an Early Stage and Already Disrupting MarketsSince Bitcoin was created in 2009, meaning that crypto’s already over 10 years old. But now’s the time it’s’ really taking off — and the growth it’s’ going to see over the next decades is likely to be a whole load more exciting than what we’ve seen up until now. You could say, the stage we’re at now is like the internet in the 90s.In fact, if you look at the numbers of people who’ve adopted cryptocurrencies over the last decade, it looks a lot like the adoption of the internet back in the 90s. Deutsche Bank have pointed out this similarity — and they predict that adoption rates are going to keep on at the same rate as the internet after the 90s. In other words, it’s going to keep on going up — in a spectacular way.And just like the internet’s disrupted literally everything over the last twenty years — we’re probably looking at blockchain doing the same over the coming decades.15Big Business Is Taking It SeriouslyLook at the list of companies that already accept payment in Bitcoin. Microsoft. AT&T. McDonalds, KFC and Subway. Virgin Galactic. CheapAir. Gyft. 4Chan. Norwegian Air. Twitch. Sports clubs like the Dallas Mavericks, Miami Dolphins or Portuguese soccer club Benfica. And Wikipedia accepts donations in Bitcoin.True, other companies are still reluctant to allow payments in it — because, it’s still volatile. But that’s bound to even out over time, and more and more big business will accept Bitcoin — and other crypto — as payment.And remember how we mentioned that Twitter’s Jack Dorsey’s talked about it being the future of money?
