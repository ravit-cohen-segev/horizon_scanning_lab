The trains are famous for their super fast speeds of 240–320 km/h. The Shinkansen uses an Automatic Train Control (ATC) system to eliminate the requirement of the trackside signals. Additionally, it uses the Automatic Train Protection system which is a centralized traffic control that networks and computerizes all tasks related to train movements, tracks, stations and schedules. And yes, most of these systems are powered by3.High-Tech Road Traffic Control Running On Linux!How about high-tech traffic control system, which can read and influence the rate of traffic flow, read the time intervals of outgoing and incoming network traffic that can help in making complex network traffic policies and shape the mechanism using a variety of algorithms. Sounds like a super technology? As per Funtoo's report, San Francisco has recently started to use such traffic controllers and yes they are powered by4The In-Vehicle-infotainment (IVI) systems which are used in automobiles is the latest trend in the auto industry which delivers entertainment and information content to the travellers. Although every IVI system has different features, the basic functions these devices perform are managing and playing audio content, utilizing navigation for driving, delivering entertainment to the rear seater like movies, games, social networking, reading out incoming and sending outgoing SMS text messages, making phone calls, and providing access to the network-enabled content like traffic conditions, sports scores and weather forecasts.And one of the largest automobile manufacturers, Toyota is using Linux as the base platform for its IVI technologies! Aren't you proud?5. Linux Powers The New York Stock ExchangeOne of the fastest moving businesses of trading stocks, bonds and derivatives, the world of financial exchanges are becoming Linux friendly. Yes, the largest exchange of the world, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has replaced their Unix based systems with Linux. The systems can generate 1,500,000 quotes and process 250,000 orders every second together with producing acknowledgments of every transaction within two milliseconds. Go Linux!6. Linux Helping In Power Particle Physics ResearchCERN, the largest particle physics laboratory of the world trusts upon our beloved Linux to control its huge particle accelerator. The laboratory makes use of Scientific Linux (SL), the Linux distro produced by Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Scientific Linux like any other Linux distro is free and open sourced and is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.7. Linux On Air Traffic Control SystemsThe FAA's (Federal Aviation Administration) Common ARTS software of the United States has been moved to Linux. The air traffic control computer system, Common ARTS (or Automated Radar Terminal System), is used to track aircrafts. It automates the air traffic controllers job by synchronizing various radar and human inputs. Most of the TRACONs around U.S. are using this system.8.Nuclear Submarines Running On LinuxThe U.S. Department of Defense is using Linux in many of its technologies and the U.S. Army is “the” single largest install base for Red Hat Linux.

While the project source code has grown since then, I have no reason to believe that those standards haven’t been maintained. At roughly 55 million lines of code (last I checked, and depending on how you count lines of code), maintaining consistency and standards are critically important to ensure maintainability of the code base. While the clarity of the code can vary slightly from one developer to another (not all developers think exactly the same way, just like non-developer people don’t all think exactly the same way), the source code could not be described as anything even approaching “convoluted and messy.” And I personally know many people at Microsoft who understand the code today.Now, because of the sheer size of the project, most individual developers don’t have detailed knowledge of the whole thing at once. They tend to specialize and work on certain areas. This is typically the case in all very large software projects. When an individual developer does need to understand a new area of the Windows source code that they haven’t ventured into yet, they find readable, maintainable code there.Having said that, bugs exist in, and new bugs are sometimes introduced into, all non-trivial software that is being actively maintained or developed. This fact of life is not unique to the Windows project, and is not necessarily a reflection of the state of the source code.",38 followers,Scott Rainey,2.3K,2.5K,6.3M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-powerful-OS-for-programmers

Starlord isn’t very well educated, and makes bad decisions, but he displays tactical skill and is fairly clever, so he’ll be the smartest of the dumbest. Scarlet Witch likely lacks comprehensive education due to her home being a war torn battlefield, and relies on her, admittedly powerful, abilities. She’s under Starlord. It’s hard to say for Groot without knowing what he’s saying, he’ll be a big Unknown. Mantis likely lacks education, and doesn’t display much skill, so she’s under Scarlet. For Drax, well, at least Mantis follows the plan.Drax is the winner. I can confidently say he is the dumbest MCU superhero.Sorry dude, it’s just how it is.

Well did you know that back in 1990s, when there wasn’t a HUGE rivalry between Marvel and DC, there was a crossover called JLA/Avengers.Yeah. Back In the day, there weren’t many fanboys debating which one is better. The writers were actually friends, and they created crossovers. Now, there aren’t even any crossovers anymore. In fact, Stan Lee was in the new Teen Titans movie, and he was about to be featured in a Super Man show. Back then, the Marvel and DC writers and companies were at least friendly. They were rivals, but they were still friendsIn fact, it’s been highly speculated that Barry Allen traveled to the Marvel universe one time. I mean come on man. That showed how even though they were fierce rivals, they still worked together on some easter eggsNow, its considered like a taboo if Marvel is friends with DC. Before, fans couldn’t care if you were a DC or Marvel fanboy. It doesn’t matter which heroes you liked, as long as the hero is fleshed out and has cool moments. You guys could still gossip. Now, in 2018, if you say Marvel is better, there are fanboys who have the compulsion to fire back and say Marvel sucks. It’s a shame that instead of moving forward, we are moving backward and hating on each other.But back to the point. So I mention on perspective right? Here’s the thing.Some people like DC Super Heroes because they areIn All Star Super Man, a boy was about to commit suicide, Super Man stops him, and comforts him.He is also the First Super Hero in the world. Without Super Man there wouldn’t be Marvel, Spider Man, or Batman. All superhero characters are based on his template. The origin story, the superpowers, the secret identity, the love interest, and the villains. He’s obviously not the first character in history to have all of these things but the classic superhero tale is all Superman’s.People complain that Super Man is boring because he’s too nice, he’s too good, and he’s just not interesting. They probably haven’t even read Super Man. Super Man is basically Clark Kent, Kal-El, and Super Man.Clark Kent is a guy who’s born on a farm in Kansas. He’s nerdy, humble, and doesn’t stand out. Sounds kinda familiar right? Because clark Kent is US. Clark is the nerd who does what’s right and doesn’t get the recognition. Clark is the guy who is good at a lot of stuff, but doesn’t get noticed. He’s the guy loves the beautiful girl at work and can’t seem to get her attention because of the big strong guy in the cape she’s in love with. That’s Clark Kent. The mild-mannered reporter.Kal-el. The alien sent to earth who is just a little bit different. The immigrant with the american dream. Kal-el may be an alien, but how does that make him any different than us? We’ve all felt alienated. We’ve all felt different, and that we need to hide who we are to fit in. We feel like there’s nobody else like us. We’ve been to new places, started new schools and jobs and gone to new countries where we are very much out of our element. Kal-el is this person in all of us. Diametrically, Kal-el is also the person Superman wasSuperman. The hero. Superman is the guy we all want to be. He’s strong, he’s fast and he can FLY! Love him or hate him, you would be Superman if you had the chance. He’s what we all wish we could be. The nerd who can take off his glasses and be strong and get noticed. He’s also an ideal. This is where people find him too alienating. They can’t seem to be able to connect with the idea that a man with all the power in the world would use his strength to help others and not for personal gain. And if that concept is too foreign to you, than you are beyond help in many ways. I think the idea of this guy who just wants to do good and help others is a beautiful idea. But there’s also the action hero side of Superman. He may want to do good, but he’s a strong dude and he’s not afraid to hit something. He’s a man of action of justice. And he will fight for what’s right.Super Man is considered by some people to be the best hero because he’s both relatable and inspiring at the same time.People also like Batman because he’s one of the most inspirational super heroes.Batman is not designed to be relatable. . I don’t know too many humans who are infinitely wealthy, driven by vengeance, and pathologically broody.But the key point is this. As a child, Bruce Wayne had a huge tragedy in front of him. But instead of being corrupt and being angry, he decided to channel his energy to fight crime to prevent kids from losing their parents. He had a dark past, but instead of choosing the easy way out and being a criminal, he fought against Fate and became a superhero. A lot of people are inspired about this, and believe that even if they have a dark past (like a drug or drinking addiction) they can change their life around.Batman strictly follow his principle – Never kill anyone. He believes that no one has the rights to end someone’s life. Even when many tried to convince him that killing the bad ones is the only way to stop them, he never gave up on his principle.Ra’s Al Ghul: “Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share”Batman: “That’s why it’s so important. It separates us from them”.Batman is also inspiring because he’s one of the founding members of the Justice League. He’s standing next to beings who are revered as gods. But does he cower or show any signs of being uncomfortable. No. He stands up to them, and even talks down on them, and they often listen. This inspires people, because no matter if you’re a nerd, you can stand next to jocks or people who play sports as equals.But you must be thinking, gee this guy talks a lot about DC Super Hero Heroes, he must love DC right hahahahaWRONGLet’s talk about my boy, Spider Man over here.People like Spider Man why? Because he’sBut do people relate to Batman? Are people billionaires, or at least millionaires? Are they super genius who can solve almost any problem? Can they create gadgets, as well as machines and cars and tanks? Are they a head of their company? Can they learn countless martial arts?NO.Spider Man is relatable, because he’s like US. Back in the 1960s, Stan Lee decide to create a risky move. He decide to create a teenage superhero not as a sidekick, but as a loner.Back in the day, teenage superheroes had to be sidekicks so it could appeal to younger audience because most writers don’t know how to write a story where a teenager could act independently, and it could boost the mentor’s sales. They also thought that a teenage superhero wasn’t a good idea, and could give them a bad reputation.Stan Lee was like SCREW THAT. Just because you’re a teenager doesn’t mean you aren’t qualified to be a superhero. Just because you’re a boy doesn’t mean you have to be a sidekick. Spider Man was a teenager, when he would react to danger, he would react what a teenager would react. A teenager wouldn’t look at a bad guy and say “Pfft. This guy is nothing. I could do this all day.” No, a teenager would be like “oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit.”In DC, you had Batman. you had superman. you had all these superheroes who were MEN, who all children could aspire to, and all the children could be men and superheroes if they eat their vegetables or something like that. A nerdy kid would read that and be like “oh dang. I want to be like that. Except I’m not because I’m just a boy who’s a loser and don’t have any chicks.”Spider Man came along and say “Hey nerdy kid. you too can be a superhero because you’re just like me.”Super Man may be an alien, but did he had to worry about acing his classes? Super Man became a superhero when he first got a job. Did Batman have to worry about curfew? Batman does this superhero thing all night! Does Bruce and Clark Kent have to worry about asking girls out? No, because Clark already have a girlfriend, and Bruce is a playboy. Not many comic readers are playboy, or have girlfriends. Spider Man was what every superhero was. He had to study, but he can’t because he’s too busy fighting crime. he has to worry about money issues, and needs to find a job. He has to contemplate whether he should use his 20 dollars for his bus pass, his lunch, or to use it for web shooters.Every human being has struggled with doing the right thing at some point. Every human being has had problem in life bombard them to the point they aren’t sure what to do. People like spidey because he shows us ourselves in a way that shows we can overcome the mundane if we don’t give up. In fact, Peter’s first job was at the Daily bugle, where his boss doesn’t even like Spider Man, so Peter has to take pictures so that his boss can publish Anti-Spider Man news. talk about bad luck. But does Peter complain about it? No. He has to push on and keep on doing it because he is self-less and he needs to do it not for him, but for his aunt. He also gets underpaid, but has to deal with it.Peter parker gets bullied at school, but he can’t fight back or else he will risk his identity out. He can’t seem to make that many friends because he’s an introvert. If you think of your typical teenage comic book reader in the 1970’s, Spider-Man hit all the right buttons.Finally, people like Spider Man because of his attitude. Even in the face of danger, peter quipps not because he finds it funny, but because he’s nervous so he’s trying to relieve tension. That’s what a teenager should react. When Batman and Super man meet a bad guy, they often react with confidence or without emotion, just wanting to get the job done. when Spider Man meets a strong super villain, he is nervous, but he uses humor to disguise it. People also like Spider Man because it’s more colorful and unique and Batman and Superman. Spider Man also learns martial arts too, which some people could relate to.So now that I got that out of the way, the million dollar question. Which one do I prefer. DC Or Marvel? or which one’s better.Like I said, it all boils down to the reader’s perspective. Do people like heroes that inspire people (Batman, Super Man) or do people like super heroes that relate to people (Spider Man).In fact, this was point out in JLA/ Avengers.When the Justice League arrived in the Marvel universe, they were shocked and dismayed at the Avenger’s efforts to improve their Earth.Super Man is EXTREMELY angered by this because even with all the powers, the Marvel super heroes have failed to improve the Earth’s conditions. He feels that they haven’t been doing their job correctly.When the Marvel heroes got the Ultimate Nullifier away during a skirmish, Super Man says he doesn’t respect them at all.Similarly, when the Avengers arrived in DC Universe, they were shocked and in awe of how futuristic the DC Universe is, and surprised how beloved the super heroes are, compared to the Marvel universe where everyone hates mutants and blames super heroes for destruction.Captain America is furious about this because he believes that Justice League are treating the civilians like public. He believes they are treated like Gods, and believes that superheroes should protect people’s freedoms, not demand people’s adoration.on one hand, I do understand why Super Man is ticked off. It seems that the Avengers aren’t doing their job right. There are so many drug dealers, so many people that are in poverty, so many people that are corrupt. He believes that the Avengers aren’t doing their job to the fullest ability. But the issue is that the Marvel universe is more cynical than DC Universe. The public hate the mutants because they’re not normal, they’re like abomination. But in the DC universe, everyone accepts superheroes.And for captain America, I understand why he’s ticked off. His ideals are that everyone should have equal rights and be treated equally. He believes that being a superhero is for people to not be scared for them. He believes that being a superhero will help the civilians be at ease so they won’t be afraid of danger, because they know the Avengers will arrive. He doesn’t agree with you should be a super hero because of the public will adore you. That’s not what being a superhero is about. It’s about saving people, not making you popular. He doesn’t like how, in his perspective, the Justice League are like fascists, and they are considered Gods.In conclusion, people prefer Marvel because they have characters that are more relatable. People prefer DC because they have characters that inspire you. But there shouldn’t be which one’s better or not. I mean, if DC and Marvel super heroes can hang out, I am pretty sure Marvel and DC fans could hang out.","1,797 followers",Brannon Sells,2.3K,415,8.1M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Moon-Girl-really-the-smartest-Marvel-character

But you can’t seem to fathom how Fremen might have diversity in their skin color.I mean… If the Fremen are aliens that come with different skin colors like blue, purple, pink, green… you probably couldn’t care less. But you immediately become uncomfortable and want to know WHY when Fremen might have real-world skin color differences, like you know, from brown to beige.Sure, fine. Let’s talk about sci-fi people’s skin color.Possibility number 1: the original Fremen people have diverse skin colors before they migrate to Arrikas. There’s no reason to believe Fremen are racially homogenous people, to begin with.Possibility number 2: At some point in their history, a genetic mutation created lighter or darker skin people. And since Fremen aren’t fucking racist asshats, they treat their people equally regardless of their skin color.Possibility number 3: The sand cocaine randomly impacts people’s skin color. Some people ended up becoming darker, other people end up becoming lighter. Oh, that’s too much? But cocaine-powered interstellar traveling isn’t?There’s no reason for the Great Houses to be (predominately) white. There’s no reason for the Fremen to be (predominately) black or brown. There’s no reason for any of the groups to be “racially homogenous”.Because RACE IS NOT BIOLOGICAL. Skin color is biological, nose shape, eyelid folds, those are biological. But race is a social construct.Unless the Dune world shares the same fucked up history as 17th-century colonialism, scientific racism, and the transatlantic slave trade, race as a concept does not exist in that world.",3 followers,Feifei Wang,1.1K,9.2K,112.9M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-powerful-OS-for-programmers

Now, the operating system cannot be modified and you have a lot of RAM to do things.Finally, add a second hard (or solid state) drive to your computer that contains your information, and a third solid state drive that backups that information upon request. Just in case of ransomware.Now you’re fine. The operating system is fine, because it cannot be changed, no matter what you do (or the virus does). Worst case scenario: It removes your files on the primary drive and you can restore from a backup.Or just remove the secondary information storage systems, and have everything in RAM. Got a virus? Reboot, and it’s gone! Along with all your data, but still!This may be very impractical, but at least you can access the Internet. And maybe memory dump on a USB to extend sessions.OK, now here’s the Prevention method. It offers the most security, and the most like a normal computer, but requires much better specs.Every application that connects to the internet runs in a separate lightweight operating system inside a virtual machine. You can access the files on that virtual machine from your computer, but the virtual machine can’t access your files. Worst case scenario, you lose your files, and need to reinstall the virtual machine(s) (the OS will hopefully do it for you!). The operating system cannot be modified, so it is fine.So, basically, it is incredibly easy to build an operating system that cannot be affected by any attacks or viruses; just make an unwritable disk! However, protecting the files on your computer is up to the user.The problem is not making a box unopenable; it is making it openable to those who need to open it.You can also prevent internet downloads entirely, by keeping them inside a virtual machine permanently. This will make it impossible for the main computer to be affected by viruses.Here’s how secure you can get:This will prevent USB and/or internet downloads affecting anything but each other. Self-contained apps will be fine.…and that is the closest you can get.",8 followers,Nicholas Hayes,4.2K,4.1K,1.5M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-powerful-OS-for-programmers

It classified systems into layers and levels based on compliance with their model. The model set out eight ""levels"":Level D - minimal protectionNetworking came along inDo note, the Orange Book and it's companions were replacedAnyway, the point is, there's a theoretical construct for how an operating system could be constructed to insure that nothing unintended actually executes. The devil is in the details, though, and it's ponderously difficult to actually accomplish. Note the really, really big ""break"" is between the level B and level A systems - B is based on measured performance, A is based on ""Verified Design"" - you have to more or  less mathematically prove that your code does what it's claimed to do. That's challenging for upper-level CS sample problems; it's nearly impossible for a whole OS.I led a team in the 80s that worked on a B2 level ""interpretation"" ofThere's a ton of work in the space, as there's a huge amount of DoD money and sensitive enterprise customers with big bank accounts willing to pay for it.

34,"Under popular computer architectures, I will contend that it is not possible to make a system 100% resistant to viruses and attacks.  Separating good and malicious software is a matter of opinion, not engineering.  There is nothing that a virus or attack does that might not be the realm of a legitimate program.All you can do is reduce the threat surface.  A lot of that comes down to defining acceptable and unacceptable behaviors and acting accordingly.For example, even if Apple iOS were 100% resistant to viruses and attacks, someone dropping signed malware into the App Store would still be ablUnder popular computer architectures, I will contend that it is not possible to make a system 100% resistant to viruses and attacks.

When leaving my PC, I just push a button and my PC is no longer connected to the internet. If I forget, it turns off by itself after a time. This, of course, does not work with WiFi. I also have used every anti-virus available and found Malwarbytes to be far superior to any others. I one time knew my PCwas messed up and tried two well known anti-virus products.
