You know we call ourselves 中国, which is ‘central country’ in English. Can you see the idea here? We are at the centre of the world, everyone else is surrounding us, we are the most important ones, something like that. So, at this time, USA is the centre of the world, of course we need to and have to compare with USA, to see how far away we are behind USA, and what areas we need to put our efforts on, and how are we gonna to accomplish the goals in order to surpass USA and become the centre of the world.Secondly and more importantly, the simpler logic is that if you desire to improve yourself, you got to learn from others who are doing better than you, right? You can't make you better by comparing with someone who's far far worse than you, that is no point.Furthermore, to those who know China so less, I got to tell you that China is not just comparing with USA, in Chinese customs, there are only two nations in the world, one is our country 中国, another one is 外国, called ‘foreign country’ in English. So in reality, it is not China vs USA, it is China vs the rest of the world.That is why you can see that we compare China with Japan in the field of environment, and then of course we get a conclusion that we China is not doing good enough in the area of maintaining environment friendly, in this case, Japan represents the rest of the world, and hence, we China is behind the world, we got to work more on this area.And still we compare our technology industries with Germans, once again, Germany in this case represent the whole world, then we still feel we got more to learn from the world.Of course we will never compare ourselves to NK or Iraq or some country in Africa.Why do we always compare ourselves to USA?

Now apart from being an awesome ship from an awesome movie (the last act kind of goes off the rails but it's still great.) This ship could be shown in just about any “realistic” sci-fi show and I, personally, would believe it 100%.I think it's the design that does it, as well as showing us that, aside from the sophisticated AI, nothing about this ship is over the top, or unbelievable. It's engines are just normal, rocket fuel powered engines. They have sensors to send and receive radio and data transmissions, and even go so far as to tell us their range eventually makes them useless. The ship has an onboard “oxygen garden"", where water is recycled, and food is grown for the crew, which in turn provides the necessary oxygen they need for the trip, both too and from.

Here’s a shot from the show showing what the ship might look like:This one is cheating, for reasons I won’t say because … spoilers. But this was a fun little miniseries, that reeled me in and then just sort of went all over the place, but the ship did a lot of things right. Better I think than Discovery since it is possible that all that stuff onscreen might actually fit inside it, and more advanced because it’s designed to be a generational ship for travelling a long way over a very long period of time, whereas Discovery’s mission took them to just Jupiter. I say that because they show a lot of shots of it, and a lot of schematics onscreen. The design of the ship plays into the plot of each of the parts of the series in different ways.Firstly, instead of spinning for artificial gravity, it used acceleration. So it sped up until it started reaching the end of its engines’ efficiency, and then it would flip around and slow down for the rest of the journey—always maintaining 1G. That’s a cool thing, but it meant it had to have giant engines to keep up velocity during the middle of the journey. Oh and the engines worked by making a lot of little nuclear explosions to drive the ship forward. This idea came from a real idea that NASA was looking into called project Orion. Whether it would be possible to generate constant 1G thrust, well, maybe if there were lots and lots of little explosions. The setting though is that everyone was from the ‘60s, and it was 50 years into their journey. And at the time, this would have been plausible.Secondly, it used water to prevent radiation from reaching the crew. Lots of water. Now, the weird thing is while they talk about using water to block radiation, when you actually watch the show, the water doesn’t seem to be in the right places for this. Like the little swimming hole the people can go to is in the middle of the ship instead of the outside, and the front/top of the ship has what appears to be a big glass or plexiglass window. That’s a bad design in general because it wouldn’t be thick enough to protect them, but I guess, for their purposes it sort of works—but I like that they point out the water is useful for this, even if I don’t get to see it being there.The other thing that is a tad annoying is that while the bottom of the ship is all pretty plausible, most of the action happens at the top where the elite live, and that’s like a fancy hotel plopped on top of what otherwise would be a mostly functional vessel. The effect of this is that there are decks that are just rows of livestock, and tight galleys where food is prepared, and then this little 6 or so storey area where everything is nice. The ship is essentially a skyscraper, so whenever someone has to run, they can only go so far and then they have to move vertically. All the luxurious spaces have tall ceilings, but are tight horizontally. They made a lot of effort to make sure the thing fit inside itself.The other thing that was interesting about it was that the creators of the ship (both in and out of story) were very concerned about the psychology of the folks on it. As a generational ship 50 years into its voyage, a lot of the crew never saw Earth, and there’s this concern that there may be no future for them when they arrive at the destination. So the ship creators gave them lots of little things to distract them from this, and while a lot of people want to look at the engineering, I think having distractions is important. And this is a realistic issue.There is some tech that shouldn’t be there for a ship launched in the 1960s, so it’s implausible that the concept of the show could have happened, and without spoiling it, there are some other things that the crew should have figured out, and tech that seems too good for its time.Related warning: This show was cancelled early, and while it starts out promising and intriguing, the hasty wrap up will bother you if you try to get into it. Also, they break from plausibility to introduce a character with “magic” powers when they were flailing around trying to keep financing.

52,"Q: Which science fiction spaceship is the most scientifically credible?Putting aside the MAV in The Martian, which is basically lifted from Bob Zubrin’s pro Mars Colonization crusade, I would say Discovery (XD-1) in 2001 A Space Oddyssey and Leonov from 2010.Both these spacecraft use rotation for artificial gravity and nuclear power with some unspecified crazy high ISP plasma drive. Both appear armored against radiation. Both segregate the crew from the reactor. Both are slow as hell, but the Leonov, which is faster, must use aerobraking and in-the-field refueling. Neither are quite to scale,Q: Which science fiction spaceship is the most scientifically credible?Putting aside the MAV in The Martian, which is basically lifted from Bob Zubrin’s pro Mars Colonization crusade, I would say Discovery (XD-1) in 2001 A Space Oddyssey and Leonov from 2010.Both these spacecraft use rotation for artificial gravity and nuclear power with some unspecified crazy high ISP plasma drive.

53,"So many awesome answers. Personal favourites go out to all the mentions of basically everything from Expanse, Starfuries and the Babylon stations from B5 etc.Another Orion inspired design is from the anime Knights of Sidonia (yes it’s an anime but definitely sci-fi).TheSo many awesome answers. Personal favourites go out to all the mentions of basically everything from Expanse, Starfuries and the Babylon stations from B5 etc.Another Orion inspired design is from the anime Knights of Sidonia (yes it’s an anime but definitely sci-fi).TheUpdate: According to the wiki there is a *sigh* gravity device that maintains gravity when the engines are off (which is a let down and makes it less scientifically credible as a design but if we ignore the never seen gravity device and imagine the engines are on and creating gravity it still makes the design work).When the ship changes trajectories to avoid an incoming threat the g-forces are brutal and there is a horrifying scene where the inhabitants are thrown about (they all wear harnesses to attach to secured railings in these kind of events).It uses a vertical layout whereby the central chamber is hollow with a massive vertical city dominating the central sections.Looking at the layout the water section appears to be at the top of the ship which is an interesting choice (good for forward protection I guess). But no protection from the ships engines (possibly not highly radioactive). However, the lower levels are mostly uninhabited automated food/machine factories. One interesting/awesome point to note, there is a magnetic accelerator cannon that runs 28km out of the 29km length of Sidona, and the rounds are stupid big and have to be countered by the engines to prevent recoil damage.",11 followers,Michael Brescia,749,1.3K,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Chinese-keep-comparing-China-to-the-USA-when-China-still-hasnt-put-a-man-on-the-moon-something-the-USA-did-49-years-ago
