3,"Mostly because he was the senior astronaut (selected with Group 2 in 1962; the other two were Group 3), and, unlike Aldrin and Collins, Armstrong had already been a mission commander. He had also impressed NASA management with how cooly he handled a serious in-flight emergency on his Gemini flight. “Hours in space” was a secondary consideration, if that.",0 followers,Peter Loftus,503,3K,2.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-YouTube-channels-for-learning-growth-and-development

All three men were excellent and demonstrated that each of them were at the top of their game for the mission. Previous time in space was not a guide really as the different missions 8, 10 and 12 in the Gemini programme had various different lengths and objectives.Image: Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin…Collins demonstrated that he had excellent piloting skills and carrying out various maneuvres such as extracting the LEM and walking in space, which were both skills he used in his one previous flight of Gemini 10. He was the back up pilot for Apollo 8 which meant normally he would have flown on Apollo 9, however he had a back injury, which meant he was deferred to Apollo 11. There were some emergency scenarios that the astronauts had not trained for, but the crew had written procedures and Collins had studied these in detail. If Mike Collins was driving your ride home, you could be confident that in the event of a problem, you were in safe hands.Image: Collins in the command module…Aldrin was super smart, being the first astronaut with a doctorate in science. His doctoral thesis was on Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, so he had an unparalleled understanding of space flight and the LEM systems on top of his Gemini 12 flight experience. This knowledge was tested to the limit during the Apollo 11 landing, where he was able to make several calls including spotting that checking the altitude was initiating some of the 1202 alarms. Throughout the landing he can be heard reading out vital data to Armstrong even though at one point the computer display went completely blank.Image: Aldrin descends from the LEM to the moon…Armstrong however was the best choice for commander because he had demonstrated on two previous occasions that in unpredictable situations he would make the right call. In Gemini 8 he had saved the spacecraft, when a thruster jammed and put the craft into a fast spin, seconds from unconsciousness he was able to regain control. This incident meant that the mission was cut short from its initial planned 3 day length. Later in training, the ‘flying bedstead’ trainer that the astronauts used to practice landing, malfunctioned and he was able to eject at just the right moment.

Only two other Mercury astronauts, Cooper and Schirra had been in the program as long as Grissom. Cooper was not all that highly regarded and never got an Apollo mission; Schirra commanded Apollo 7 and quit NASA afterwards.Neil Armstrong was possibly the best test pilot NASA had and that’s saying something. He’d already proven his calmness under fire many times in his career, as a Korean War combat pilot in the Navy, as a test pilot, as commander of the near-disaster Gemini 8 mission where he saved the day with a virtual last-gasp maneuver.The Apollo 11 mission had first been offered to the Apollo 8 crew of Borman, Lovell and Anders, the first men to orbit the moon. However, without even consulting with the others, Borman turned it down. When Armstrong was offered the command spot he was also told that Buzz Aldrin would either be the command pilot or the lunar pilot. Armstrong was then offered his choice of two other men, Mike Collins as command pilot or Fred Haise as lunar pilot. Either choice, Aldrin was going most certainly because he was the only PhD holder among the astronauts and their resident expert on orbital maneuvers. If something went wrong with the orbital rendezvous, NASA wanted their top expert on the scene. I believe the biggest reason Armstrong chose Collins over Haise was that Collins was also a trained test pilot whereas Aldrin, who was a Korean War ace, was not. If the Eagle got into trouble, they’d need Columbia to attempt a rescue and no doubt Armstrong wanted the strongest pilot available as Command Pilot if that happened. That meant Collins. So, Aldrin got to be the 2nd man on the Moon and the odd-man-out Haise was lunar pilot for the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission.I don’t know if it had any role in the decision but temperamentally, Armstrong was the perfect choice for being first man on the moon. He was a very private person, uncontroversial, very taciturn. Aldrin on the other hand was already well into an alcoholism problem before the moon mission (he stopped drinking a few weeks before the flight). His own mother, mentally unstable, killed herself after learning Buzz would be on the moon landing. Aldrin was in and out of rehab and mental hospitals after his return from the moon and I doubt he would’ve shouldered the acclaim and fame of being the first moonwalker as easily as Armstrong. Most likely, he would’ve killed himself or drank himself to death at some point. Instead, he got serious about rehab and is in his 90s, the only surviving member of the Apollo 11 crew. Not being the first man on the moon probably added 30 years to his life..","3,591 followers",Mark Shulmann,2.4K,2.2K,34.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-YouTube-channels-for-learning-growth-and-development
6,"Because he wasn't. Pete Conrad was initially chosen as the future commander of Apollo 11 when he was originally picked as backup commander of Apollo 8.But let's make things simpler first: there were two main reasons: precedence and coincidence.All the Apollo comanders in the initial missions had previous command experience. Armstrong had already commanded one mission (Gemini VIII) while Aldrin and Collins hadn't. He had precedence. He outranked Aldrin and Collins. It was only with Apollo 15 that an astronaut without previous command experience commanded a mission.The other reason - coincidenceBecause he wasn't.

Armstrong had already commanded one mission (Gemini VIII) while Aldrin and Collins hadn't. He had precedence. He outranked Aldrin and Collins. It was only with Apollo 15 that an astronaut without previous command experience commanded a mission.The other reason - coincidence - is a bit more complex.Back in those days, Deke Slayton was the chief of the astronauts and the guy who picked each astronaut for each mission. He implemented a rotation system for Gemini and Apollo in which the backup commander in one mission would be the prime commander three missions later. Slayton had full confidence in all of his veteran astronauts, especially the ones that had already commanded at least one mission. He believed that any of those veteran astronauts could be the first man on the moon. Absolutely anyone of them.This rotation system meant that whoever was chosen as backup commander of Apollo 8 was poised to become the prime commander of Apollo 11.And the person chosen for backup commander of Apollo 8 was Pete Conrad. Neil Armstrong was chosen as backup commander of Apollo 9, which would place him as prime commander of Apollo 12, not 11.Now one thing happened in August 1968 that changed everything. Grumman, the builder of the Lunar Module, anounced they wouldn't be able to deliver a LM that year. It would have to wait until 1969. That meant NASA would have to postpone the Apollo 8 mission so it could fly with a LM. But NASA didn't want to do that. Instead, they decided Apollo 8 would fly all the way to the moon without a LM.The problem was, the crew for the Apollo 8 mission was already well ahead in training with the LM, while the crew for the Apollo 9 hadn't trained as much. Sending the crew of Apollo 8 without a LM would be a huge waste of training. So what NASA did? They swapped the crews. The original crew for Apollo 9 would fly on Apollo 8 and vice-versa.Here’s where everything changed: when the Apollo 8 and 9 prime crews swapped places, so did their backup crews. That means Pete Conrad, who was backup commander of Apollo 8, wouldn't be prime commander of Apollo 11 anymore. Instead he would command Apollo 12. And Neil Armstrong, backup commander of Apollo 9, wouldn't command Apollo 12. He would command Apollo 11.And all that happened after Deke Slayton, the guy who picked each astronaut for each mission, realized none of the people he actually wanted to be the first man on the moon was available.He wanted Gus Grissom, but Grissom died. Then Slayton went after Frank Borman, but Borman said there wasn't enough time to train to command Apollo 8 and then immediately move to Apollo 11, which was much more complex. Then Slayton asked Jim McDivitt, but he also said he couldn’t train for Apollo 9 and 11 in a row. Finally Slayton decided to just let the rotation system work, which would initially place Pete Conrad in the command of Apollo 11.But when Grumman anounced the LM wouldn't be ready and NASA decided to swap the Apollo 8 and 9 crews, the future commander of Apollo 12 became the future commander of Apollo 11.And that guy was Neil Armstrong.In other words, Armstrong wasn't chosen to be the first man on the moon. It was pure coincidence that placed him in that position.If it was just for time in space, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell had logged many more hours. Both had already commanded missions too. But in the end the rotation system and LM delays defined everything.

See was initially assigned as Armstrong’s junior on 8, so Armstrong, Borman and McDivitt were likely considered the steadiest of the lot. The failure and premature abort of Gemini 8 was no mark against Armstrong. Though he (and his pilot, Dave Scott) acted commendably during the emergency, they were test pilots and this was expected of them. Regardless of the outcome, Armstrong had commanded a mission and was indisputably senior to the ’63 astronauts.Collins was one of the stars of the ’63 class - the first to receive a crew assignment, as backup to Jim Lovell on Gemini 7, which put him in line to be pilot on Gemini 10. The mission was typical of the standard plan for the last five Gemini missions (3 days in space, dock with Agena, boost to higher orbit, spacewalk). It was the first to achieve all these milestones in one (6 had been forced to rendezvous with 7 rather than dock, 8 had aborted immediately after docking, 9 was unable to dock with a non-Agena target that lacked an engine anyway).Aldrin was a certified genius, but wasn’t well liked. He was not initially selected for Gemini - 12 would normally have been crewed by Stafford and Cernan, who instead found themselves on 9 after the prime crew (See and Bassett) were killed. Suddenly a new crew was needed for 12, and that was when Aldrin finally got his shot. Gemini 12 was the most successful of the lot, largely due to Aldrin’s suggestions after studying the previous flights. The mission was extended to four days, Aldrin took greater care and more rests during his spacewalks, and handholds and other elements were added to make his EVA tasks easier.But Collins had flown first. That put him in line for a prime Apollo slot earlier - Apollo 9, to be precise, while Aldrin was backup for Apollo 9 and expected to fly on Apollo 12. The crews of 8 and 9 (and their backups) ended up switching, so that Collins would now fly 8 and Aldrin 11. Collins had a herniated disc in his back and dropped out of 8 - he would be back in the rotation on 11 alongside Aldrin, with Armstrong as commander.Now, why did Collins have the CSM slot and “have to” stay in orbit, while Aldrin “got to” land on the Moon? Again, because Collins was senior. The CSM pilot was effectively second in command - partly because all three crew needed his training to get home, and partly because on Apollo 7 and 8 (flights without Lunar Modules) the putative LM pilot didn’t have a LM to fly, so that job went to the junior man in the crew. (He acted as engineer, while the CSM man acted as navigator.) Because the Commander did the flying in the LM, the LM pilot even","14,827 followers",Krister Sundelin,1.1K,23.7K,88.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Neil-Armstrong-chosen-as-Apollo-11-commander-when-the-other-two-had-considerably-more-time-in-space-Collins-had-73-hours-Aldrin-over-80-and-Armstrong-only-around-14

They knew they were long but not by how much. They had Michael Collins attempt spot Eagle on the surface as he passed over on each orbit. If they could determine exactly where they landed, they could calculate when Eagle had to launch in order to rendezvous with the command module.The rendezvous plan called for Eagle to launch into a lower circular orbit behind Columbia. Lower orbits go around the moon faster so Eagle would slowly catch up with Columbia. They had a rendezvous radar on the lunar module that could spot the command module from a long way away. Once the predetermined angle was reached between the two craft, the lunar module did the final burn to raise its orbit to match the command module on the other side of the moon. It all had to be timed so the lightning would be right and both craft could communicate with mission control. All but the last docking maneuver was done by Eagle so that none of the fuel reserves on Columbia would be wasted as they were needed to get them home. Eagle’s resources would not be needed once the two craft were docked after returning from the moon.","35,110 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,8.3K,12.3K,142.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Neil-Armstrong-chosen-as-Apollo-11-commander-when-the-other-two-had-considerably-more-time-in-space-Collins-had-73-hours-Aldrin-over-80-and-Armstrong-only-around-14

No one to back him up except Mission Control, and he had to be an expert on all the spacecraft’s systems and scientific and technical tasks to be accomplished on lunar orbit (which were extremely numerous; the CMP didn’t just hang out and wait for the LM to return).Most importantly, if the LM was unable to achieve the desired altitude on liftoff due to a malfunction, the CMP would have to perform a very fast and challenging rendezvous maneuver to retrieve them - again, completely solo.So no - while Collins and the other CMPs wanted to make a landing as much as anyone, and most hoped for their own subsequent missions as CDRs, it was very far from ‘disappointing’ for any of them to be assigned as CMP.

But,Image: Neil Armstrong (left) and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin (right) practicing lunar landing procedures in the Lunar Module simulator, probably in May or June 1969. Be thankful that the shot is in Black and White, as I’m pretty sure the colors on Armstrong’s shirt would be pretty garish to the modern eye.In addition to the other excellent answers, I would add the following insight (at least, I hope it’s insightful).Most people just don’t get what astronauts from that generation were like. They were ALL highly intelligent, superb pilots, cool under pressure, highly analytical, and brave as lions. But, within those parameters, there was lots of room for variation. Long term relationships are built on compatibility of interests and temperament; Armstrong and Aldrin were about as different as two astronauts could be. Armstrong was the ultimate technical test pilot type. Precise. Cool. Skillful. A master of the machine he commanded and of its capabilities. He had little use for theory—he was there to take his machine out on a mission and make it do what it was supposed to do.Aldrin was more of a prototype for the scientist/astronaut who would be a mainstay of the shuttle missions. Sure, he was a capable and aggressive fighter pilot, but he also had a graduate degree in orbital mechanics and did his thesis on the theoretical basis of space rendezvous. He was very much at home with theory, higher mathematics, orbital mechanics, and other highly technical subjects. He was more of a “thinker” and Armstrong was more of a “doer,” with the understanding that both men were both outstanding thinkers and doers—it was a matter of intellectual/temperamental emphasis. One of the best illustrations of the difference is that Armstrong described his view of the lunar surface as “beautiful” while Aldrin called it “magnificent desolation.”The differences between these two men appear very starkly in the debriefing transcripts (I can’t find the link right now—I’ll try to come back and insert it later). Armstrong had more useful information about the performance of the spacecraft, what it was like to fly the LM, how maneuverable it was, how easy it was to control the rate of descent, and so on. Aldrin had more detailed observations about the lunar surface, how the dust behaved, how much the soil (regolith) compacted, the apparent color of the stars and the Earth, how far he could see, what the shadows looked like, and other observations of more interest to scientists than to future pilots of this particular class of spacecraft.Another stark difference is the extent to which Aldrin was comfortable as a public person and liked attention while Armstrong stopped doing public appearances and signing autographs as soon as he was able to get away with doing so. Armstrong even instructed that he be buried at sea, presumably because he did not want his grave site to become a shrine (of course he had served in the Navy so this theory could be wrong). But, you can see how different these men were. It is no surprise that they did not become buddies.[Revised 13 January 2018—extended the discussion a bit, reorganized the text, made some editorial changes, added a bit of additional information, added image and caption.]","3,591 followers",Mark Shulmann,1K,2.2K,34.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Neil-Armstrong-chosen-as-Apollo-11-commander-when-the-other-two-had-considerably-more-time-in-space-Collins-had-73-hours-Aldrin-over-80-and-Armstrong-only-around-14

He may not have been best buds with every astronaut, but I don’t know any who refused to work with him.For the most part, astronauts were professional first, friends second.

19,"Yes. They had this:That yellow-and-black-striped handle is the forward hatch vent valve, one of two identical valves in the LM that could be used to vent the atmosphere to space (The Command Module had two similar valves, plus valves under electronic control.)If I were in a spacecraft in a truly hopeless situation—that is, I’m down to minutes of air and have tried everything and there is simply no hope of recovery, here’s what I’d do.Yes.

A few minutes later, I’d be dead, but would be long beyond caring. There would be no feeling of asphyxiation, as that choking feeling is caused by an excess of CO2, not a lack of oxygen.This is how the ladies in my story “For All Mankind” finish up after saving the Earth, and I think it’s what real astronauts would have done had it come to it. Buzz Aldrin has said as much on numerous occasions.It’s also how Buzz Aldrin has answered this exact question, many times over the years in interviews: “Why would be need a poison pill when we’ve got vacuum on the other side of the door?”If you like space, you might enjoy my",5 followers,Jake Williams,9.9K,3.2K,76.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Neil-Armstrong-chosen-as-Apollo-11-commander-when-the-other-two-had-considerably-more-time-in-space-Collins-had-73-hours-Aldrin-over-80-and-Armstrong-only-around-14
