Well, first they offered to make a special for the Quora community and they are very interested in getting feedback from Quora users and learn what other features you would like to see.Secondly, you can trade the 500 most popular stocks like Apple, Tesla, Facebook and the most known cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BAT, Commodities like oil, corn or gold and Forex 24/7 around the clock and with 0 trading fees on their platform. No other platform has that, because trading stocks is closed during the night and comes with lots of restrictions.But how do they do that if that’s so difficult?They create synthetic assets that allow you to hold the contract to a stock or even a fraction of a stock without actually having to physically own it. This allows them to bypass the current restrictions of liquidity problems and stock market openings and closes. Very smart in my opinion.They are also a legit company that resides in Austria and that is backed by Tim Draper, a billionaire and Crypto enthusiast. That is a very good combination.Ok, but how do I get that $200 now Marius!Well, you need two friends for that. Here is what you need to do:This is a total of $124 for around one hour of watching videos and answering a quiz.You are welcome, always at your service.Do you know other ways or airdrops where you can earn $50 in crypto quickly?

It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI as it’s falling from point 1 to point 2. Now the question is “Why the heck it the price going up but the RSI falling down?”.Well this is called Divergence. The real reason that this divergence showed up here is that the big (smart) money pulled out of the market at point 1 (Either all of the big smart money or a big chunk of it). Then after point 1 the price decreased for two weeks as you can see on the chart. Now that the big whales are out, the small fish came swimming and put their money in so the price goes up to point 2 but there’s a difference between price reaching point 1 and price reaching point 2. The difference is that for example 10 rich whales invested 10 billion dollars in bitcoin so it reached point 1, then they pulled out their money and the small fish came to play so 100,000 normal people invested 10 billion in bitcoin and it rose again to point 2. Do you see the difference? 10 rich smart whales don’t panic, they know what they’re doing, but 100,000 average traders who are looking to make a quick buck will panic with the first sign of danger. so from point 1 to point 2 those big whales pulled out of the market so slow and subtle that those fish didn’t suspect a thing. They kept buying the overpriced bitcoin and the whales were happy to sell at the top. One red candle shows up, the fish panic and sell like crazy and the rest is history.That divergence is the real reason why the prices dropped but there’s no reason to panic. Heavy drops are good for the market. The funny part is that now while the fish are panicking and selling their valuable assets those whales would enter again and buy the cheap coins to get ready for the $100k bitcoin (remember bitcoin dropped from $20k to $3200 to get ready for the $40k, $50k and $60k.",0 followers,Glen Boston,704,71,1.7M,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-cryptocurrencies-less-than-20-I-want-something-that-is-in-its-infancy-yet-shows-potential-like-Bitcoin

Yet, this is far from the end of the drama.Many online sources will have pointed out, Bitcoin’s price went from around S$1,200 in December 2013 to the lows of $200s in May 2015. More recently, BTC nosedived from $20,000 in December 2017 to lows of $5,800 multiple times this year.As we near the 10-year mark of Bitcoin, the speculative bubble has in fact been declared dead over 300 times on one counter. The question that many people then ask is, “What next?”What is a financial bubble?First, it helps if we understand what constitutes a bubble, why it grows and why it pops.A financial bubble describes the price of an investment that rises so sharply beyond its intrinsic value such that when people discover the true value, which is significantly lower, it triggers a massive sell-off that causes prices to plummet. The bubble has thus popped with prices falling as sharply as it has risen. Bubbles grow as a result of people’s unrealistic expectations and overly hyped up valuations.Photo by Julie Laiymani, Unsplash.In the growth phase, there is usually an overly optimistic and exuberant view towards the value of the asset. There are a number of contributory factors — lack of proper valuation measures, investors’ contagious euphoria, manipulators pumping the market.Be it the Tulip Mania, the Dotcom bubble, or the housing bubble, they all manifested signs of a misguided and hyped up investors market. Likewise, the cryptocurrency market had its phases of rapid growth where investors sentiments were overly positive.Side mention: There is a similar sense of optimism in the US stock market with an ongoing bull run that has lasted almost 10 years — a one-way growth, albeit a slow and steady one.Pop The BubbleBack to the crypto-bubble, the 2014 decline in Bitcoin prices can be largely attributed to the closing of the Silk Road, followed by the collapse of Mt Gox. The more recent bubble burst is probably due to the unsustainable ICO (Initial Coin Offering) fever.The housing bubble was held loosely by subprime loans; the Dotcom bubble was sustained by overly valued tech companies. These all came crashing down when the market realised that they have just bought the hype, and that the assets that they have acquired are in fact worth lesser.Of course, it is easy to tell on hindsight what went wrong, and how we should have seen it coming. There and then, what was going through the minds of investors before the pop?The Visionaries See The GoldOne tell-tale sign of a bubble that many people speak of is when your dentist, your hairdresser, your cab driver, or a random stranger from the road asks you if you have invested in ‘it’. When everyone starts to see the vision, you are no longer a visionary.Interestingly, cryptocurrencies are so complex that there are multiple dimensions for these visionaries to emerge. That is to say, the bubble grows, then bursts (or should I say, corrects), and then grows again with a new speculative story angle.The 2013 growth was built on the belief of a digital cash that is not governed. The 2017 growth was built on the same belief of a universal, decentralised, digital cash but what is more, smart contracts and blockchain applied to many industries.It should come as no surprise then if the next crypto market growth will be founded on current “applications” of universal money and smart contracts, but with a newly added story angle.Whether it is mass adoption by the banks, mainstream adoption as a traded asset, industrial adoptions for Internet-Of-Things (IOT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), these are all possible frames that suggest that cryptocurrencies can bring in that next bucket of gold. These are what the crypto visionaries of today see and might be also why they are still HODLing.So, Buy Cryptocurrencies?Having read all that, you might be waiting for some recommendations, or a call-to-action. And nope, I cannot guarantee that the market will grow again.What I do see though is that real work is being done across many different projects. Many of them will fail but some will pivot, and a few will be wildly successful.If and when they do, their fruits of labour will benefit all of us at little or no cost. It is just like how we have access to the Internet, to information on the World Wide Web today — we users will benefit and it will not cost us a bomb to use these services.Hence, you do not have to be an investor to reap the benefits of decentralisation and digital, secured tokens. You do not even need to buy them now, especially if you cannot stomach the risk (all investments come with risk by the way).If you do decide to buy some cryptocurrencies, it might be wise to read up on the technology and also on risk management because these will probably help you preserve your capital in the long run. Or you can simply pick up a copy ofWhilst most financial bubbles collapse and end, cryptocurrency is a non-conforming bubble. The crypto-bubble will grow again, because there is so much about cryptocurrencies that the layman do not know about yet, and there is so much potential to spin up something to create yet another market cycle.The best investment you can make is not monetary but investing in knowledge and learning.","99,872 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-know-a-way-to-get-free-cryptocurrency
