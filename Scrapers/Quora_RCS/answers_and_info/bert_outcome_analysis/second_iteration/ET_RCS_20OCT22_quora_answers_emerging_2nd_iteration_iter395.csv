The forces humanity can harness are bi or multi directional. They can move things around and squeeze things but there is always an escape route that can't be plugged effectively or if there is no escape route there is no way to add fusable material after the original sample has fused.Only gravity provides us with a force that is self fusing and self feeding at the ...","220,154 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

A nuclear weapon only requires about a microsecond or less. A power plant requires long term continuous operation with control of the output.Fusion also has another issue that is great for nuclear weapons but terrible for power plants.The high energy neutrons from fusion are great for splitting ordinary uranium in the tamper and radiation case of a weapon which is typically responsible for as much as 70 percent of the yield.They are the bane of existence for a power reactor. They rapidly degrade the structural integrity of materials and render them temporarily highly radioactive.So even if you succeed in creating a stable fusion plasma or imploding enough fuel capsules with a laser array you face the problem of preventing the neutron flux from turning your fancy reactor into a pile of radioactive waste.These problems are so difficult that many experts believe that barring some way to harness gravity like electromagnetism fusion power will remain a pipedream.","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

This was a real contest at the time, and both technologies were tried and each had some commercial success. At the time, some early auto customers might have been skeptical that a vehicle powered by thousands of small explosions inside the confined volume of an engine block would be safe and there was doubt that an engine based on producing thousands of carefully timed explosions would be reliable and hang together and be practical in the long run. Over time, the public came to feel that internal combustion engines, even though they depend on thousands of small explosions, can still be practical and safe, and the Stanley Steamer, and other model continuous burning steam powered vehicles, were abandoned as not as efficient.In the next couple of decades we may see a revisitation of the debate over smooth burning Diffuse Plasma Magnetic Confinement Fusion versus Inertial Confinement Fusion featuring a succession small controlled fusion bursts of between 100 - 250 GJ per shot. It is a harder job to keep reliable containment of a plasma at fusion conditions on a magnetic confinement device like a large tokamak that does a continuous plasma burn - the containment tends to fail and the reactor has to periodically be restarted. ICF fusion has already been demonstrated to reliably produce energy on demand (in fission ignited fusion - first-time every-time).","220,154 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

So keeping it confined with powerful magnetic fields is the primary challenge.The problem is that plasma isFluid dynamics, the study of gases and liquids in motion, requires very powerful computers to model with fine enough detail to be useful. This is why supercomputers have proved so essential in fields like aerodynamic design and weather prediction.Now, try to imagine how challenging it is to model a fluid that experiences turbulence and convection and all the phenomena that gas does, but is moving far faster, is far hotter, and is simultaneously influenced by and creating electromagnetic fields and electric currents. The mind boggles.Still, progress is being made. Some very smart people are chipping away at understanding how fusion plasma works and how to control it, but as you can see, they have their work cut out for them.Edit: To elaborate a bit since this is getting views, the success of magnetic confinement fusion is often measured with a metric called the “triple product.” This is confinement time x density x temperature. All of these are of course important. Temperature and density both affect your power output; higher densities and temperatures yield more energy per cubic meter, which is important as far as getting more energy out than you put in.So, why am I focusing on confinement? Heating the plasma isn't difficult, it's keeping it hot (which means keeping the most energetic nucleii from wriggling through your confinement fields). And higher density also requires stronger confinement fields. So both density and temperature are contingent on keeping the plasma contained. Stability is more important than field strength, too: instabilities can build and overwhelm the strongest fields. Hence the importance of understanding the minutiae of magnetohydrodynamics, and the incredibly complex modeling and math required.Again, progress is being made. Confinement times used to be measured in fractions of a second, while today fusion plasma (not just plasma but plasma undergoing fusion) has been confined for over 100 seconds at a time.","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production

Though their understanding of nuclear power is very poor.There is some slow change in Washington with Generation 4 reactors getting more recognition. Currently, there may be no detailed planning that would be needed to get approval for a reactor. There is not support from industries and businesses to get to the proposal stage. Generation 4 prototypes need to be built as the next major step in the US.Applications for licensing is very expensive and complicated. Current licensing policies are based on current reactor technology and getting approval for a generation 4 reactor would be even more complicated.I think the Chinese will be able to continue without further US support. China has started the operation of Gen 4 gas-cooled reactor using pebble bed fuel. The pebbles are made from heat resistant carbon and silicon materials that are unlikely to melt. If cooling, power or pumps fail these reactors can remain safe by using natural airflow. The pebbles are routinely checked as they go through the system. When checked they can be easily returned to the reactor or be replaced if damage is suspected or a risk. The reactor does not need to be turned off for refueling. The pebbles are easily replaced or returned to the top of the reactor as other pebbles empty from the bottom. The longer the pebbles last the more fuel is burnt and less waste is produced. No metal fuel rods that could melt are needed. And no high pressure water is in the reactor. The fuel spheres, pebbles can tolerate more than twice the heat a fuel rod. Meltdown are highly unlikely.It is also likely that China is about to complete a Molten Salt Reactor/ MSR, that also has no fuel rods or water. The fuel is mixed with the salt coolant. The salt/fuel mix can be safely drained from the reactor at any time into safe cooling tanks. Overheating will automatically drain the salt before any meltdown. The salt has an unlimited lifespan so fuel can remain in the reactor until most of the fuel is burnt. Including the radioactive products produced from fission. Leaving minimal waste. Potentially salt reactors can run on nuclear waste from current PWR reactors. Without expensive separation of the toxic products. MSR reactors should use up far more waste than they produce. No need for expensive metal fuel rods or pebbles.China also holds the record for fusion reactors. Operating a research reactor producing plasma at twice the heat of the suns core for 100 seconds.China is also building a number of advanced water-cooled reactors from different countries. India plans to build over 50 nuclear power plants.

They can also fail catastrophically, but well-designed and located plants are very unlikely to do this.If we want to get serious about halting climate change, we absolutely should consider researching and building next-generation nucleaThey produce toxic and radioactive waste and spew it into the air, poisoning the environment, sickening people, and causing climate change.Oh wait, that’s coal plants.What I meant to say is:They produce significantly smaller amounts of toxic and radioactive waste than coal plants, and that waste, while difficult to deal with, is very contained within the plant.

They are, at present, the most powerful plants we can build and they do far less damage to the environment than fossil fuel plants.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.5K,996,155.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-nuclear-fusion-been-viable-for-large-scale-energy-production
