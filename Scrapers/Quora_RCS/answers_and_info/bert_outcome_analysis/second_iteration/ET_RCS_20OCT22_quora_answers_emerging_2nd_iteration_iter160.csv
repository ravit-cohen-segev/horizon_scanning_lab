0,"1,500W for 24 hours is about 36kWh per day.Our 6.5kWP grid-tie solar located in Thailand produces about 21kWh per day on average, so for 36kWh you would need around 12kWP of solar.If you can’t do net metering you will need enough batteries to store most of that energy, say 750Ah of 48V LiFePO4.You would also need a suitable MPPT charge controller (probably several) plus either a grid-tie, hybrid or off-grid inverter dependant upon your situation.To be honest I’m not convinced that crypto-mining using solar is really viable. You’d be better off using that solar to power your home and saving on1,500W for 24 hours is about 36kWh per day.Our 6.5kWP grid-tie solar located in Thailand produces about 21kWh per day on average, so for 36kWh you would need around 12kWP of solar.If you can’t do net metering you will need enough batteries to store most of that energy, say 750Ah of 48V LiFePO4.You would also need a suitable MPPT charge controller (probably several) plus either a grid-tie, hybrid or off-grid inverter dependant upon your situation.To be honest I’m not convinced that crypto-mining using solar is really viable.

1,"Well, let’s break this down, shall we?Texas hates the idea of government regulation and federal oversight, so they built their own sandboxed energy grid and privatized the whole thing…meaning it’s a for-profit endeavor. You see, American conservatives think business and private enterprise can do basically EVERYTHING better than the government for lower cost. So what was the result of this?Increased (and defiant) investment in natural gas, crude, and coal (carbon-based) energy production. Although ERCOT is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, it still exists to make money — nonprofit does not mean it does noWell, let’s break this down, shall we?Texas hates the idea of government regulation and federal oversight, so they built their own sandboxed energy grid and privatized the whole thing…meaning it’s a for-profit endeavor. You see, American conservatives think business and private enterprise can do basically EVERYTHING better than the government for lower cost. So what was the result of this?Increased (and defiant) investment in natural gas, crude, and coal (carbon-based) energy production. Although ERCOT is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, it still exists to make money — nonprofit does not mean it does not turn a profit…and there are plenty of other Texas utilities you can invest in to make money. Because of this relentless pursuit of fiscal efficiency, they didn’t “waste” money winterizing their assets because, you know, Texas doesn’t really get THAT cold…right?Well, all it took was ONE minor cold snap and the whole social structure of the state collapsed. What’s more, because their power grid isn’t overseen by the government (or has limited oversight anyway), and don’t actually answer to anyone in Austin or Washington, no one knows how to hold anyone accountable for this. Republicans, as expected, don’t give a shit. As the former mayor of Colorado City, TX said, the state doesn’t owe anyone anything…figure it out yourselves. And now, because all of these private utilities and power companies are, you know, PRIVATE…supply and demand kicks into hyperdrive. Demand far, far exceeds what they are able to supply. So now the price of electricity in Texas is apocalyptic. These people who didn’t freeze to death or die of carbon monoxide while sleeping in front of their natural gas appliances now will have seriously absurd electricity bills for power they use. $10,000 a month is not out of the question.Ahhhhhh, it’s conservative nirvana!",0 followers,Anushree Burade,5.8K,144,1.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-solar-power-system-would-I-need-to-run-a-1500-watt-crypto-miner-24-7-My-area-has-an-average-of-4-1-peak-sun-hours
2,No.There is not a single coherent grid across the US. We saw last winter that the Texas local grid was not resilient to cascading failures. The California grid has problem handling its frequently overloads with only the minimum necessary shutdowns.,UNKNOWN,Aheli Bal,1.5K,600,13.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-would-a-catastrophic-failure-in-the-US-power-grid-affect-cryptocurrencies
3,"Falling costs come first, efficiency improvements follow a different and slower track.Falling costs come as production becomes more standardized and automated. This is a continuous process. This will continue, and may slow a bit as present methods reach the leading edge of production technology.Efficiency of the pv panels evolves with R&D, which is brains plus trial and error plus money. I remember a news article in 1977(!) declaring an impending plummet in pv prices (so, so expensive back then) because “someone"" had invented a way to spray the cell substrate into existence from a spray can.

Call it a pre-internet meme scam.Anyway, a quantum leap in efficiency will take a real leap like that one was supposed to be for cost reduction. And it likely will occur in the coming decade. One day you will read about a breakthrough which both boosts pv cell efficiency by double and halves production costs. Then you'll know we've arrived. If it's true.
