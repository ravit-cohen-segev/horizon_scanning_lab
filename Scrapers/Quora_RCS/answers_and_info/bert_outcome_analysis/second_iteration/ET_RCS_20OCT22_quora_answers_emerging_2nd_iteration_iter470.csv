That game got 7,000 download daily on its peak and I sold it to an investment firm. That money allowed me to buy a newer laptop and from then I could make games much faster and endlessly.I kept making games non stop and eventually even got a game onto Steam, which took 1–2 years to make! During this time I hired professional coders and developers to help speed the progress. However I kept making more games and more platforms and now I have another game on Steam which I plan on perfecting over the summer and publishing it.Here is my current workstation. I love using laptops and though I understand the power difference I still prefer them over desktops.But after I kept growing I even got featured on National News and that boosted the interest and increased the downloads by a bit. But it also boosts your morale and keeps you going so make sure you share your work with others for free marketing and awareness.As I mentioned earlier I started as one person on a laptop and now have dozens of games published and working on the second one with Steam.Here is a picture of my first game Apartment 666 ( in game play).Here's a sample of my second game on Steam I plan on calling it “The Cemtery”.","1,366 followers",Shahmeer Chaudhry,1.2K,334,1.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-employees-at-high-performing-divisions-of-game-development-companies-not-start-their-own-companies
1,"No.Generally they don’t need a lot of hands early in new game development. That’s because the design isn’t completely clear yet and things are still changing quickly.When development ramps up after about 1/3 into development and the dust has settled, they generally need more hands. Near the last third of development they need the most people for all roles, but especially test.It depends on the game, the studio and the current staffing. But generally early in development, they don’t need a huge team yet. Once they know what they’re building, they’ll start hiring. That could be a few weeks or moNo.Generally they don’t need a lot of hands early in new game development.

They get publishing deals that pay on a monthly milestone. This is why many of those studios do full layoffs at the end of the project (and before the next project is signed) - which, coincidently, is why we LOVE DLC so much. Having to keep a chunk of the team working for 3–6 months after shipping - with pay - is a great feeling of job security.",1 follower,Chris Nash,526,5K,30.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-employees-at-high-performing-divisions-of-game-development-companies-not-start-their-own-companies

You can have much more reliable jobs and live much more comfortable lives.You should just enjoy playing video games and go into finance or banking or something horrible that makes you enough money to play lots of video games in your off hours.Those of us who make games, we do it because we won’t be happy doing anything else.

4,"There is a misunderstanding at the heart of this question - that objects in space are cold.  At a distance of 1 AU from the Sun (Earth's orbit), an object can be up to 150 C on its light side and as low as -150 C on its dark side.  The Sun coats everything at that distance with about 1400 watts per square meter.And the Sun isn't the only concern.  Any equipment that uses electrical power is generating heat.

On the ISS, for example, there are vast radiators that reject heat to space and through those radiators and all along the truss flow pipes of ammonia and inside the vehicle flow pipes of cold water, around each module and through cold plates that are attached to each computer or other heat generating mechanism.  When a pump fails, we have to start unpowering those computers and equipment to prevent massive overheating of the ISS.So, if we put superconducting servers in space, we are going to have to surround them with thermal control systems.And we haven't even begun to discuss the complications of operating computers in the high radiation environment of space.

6,"Oooh, one of my favorite space marine topics!I see a lot to unpack around this question. To get to the heart of it, we’re going to have to discuss the case of firstborn space marines—the ones before the primaris marines—first. Once we’ve done that, the primaris part of the answer will fall out pretty quickly.There’re more more differences between space marine “tanks” and the Astra Militarum’s tanks than the tabletop may make immediately apparent.The first fewOooh, one of my favorite space marine topics!I see a lot to unpack around this question.

Once we’ve done that, the primaris part of the answer will fall out pretty quickly.There’re more more differences between space marine “tanks” and the Astra Militarum’s tanks than the tabletop may make immediately apparent.The first fewHere are the data sheets for the Predator, the standard space marine tank, and the Leman Russ, the standard Imperial Guard tank.Let me draw your attention to a couple of things.On top of this, space marine armored firepower just doesn’t hold up to the Imperial Guard’s armored firepower. The standard Leman Russ outguns the standard Predator Destructor in all roles by a significant margin—the difference between a tank cannon and a high-caliber autocannon. The Predator Annihilator achieves better firepower against hard targets by mounting a pair of lascannonsbut there are Leman Russ patterns thatand others with significantly greater anti-armor firepower, like the Leman Russ Vanquisherto say nothing of the the Guard’s arsenal of tank destroyers.The same is true for all space marine vehicles compared to their Guard equivalents. Whirlwind rocket artillery tanksare faster than Basilisk self-propelled gunsor Manticore rocket launchersbut far shorter ranged and don’t hit nearly as hard.Vindicator assault gunsare faster than Leman Russ Demolisherbut not as tough and mount the exact same gun, except that the Leman Russ version can fire it better on the move and has superior auxiliary weapons.You can argue that space marines have access to tougher, more heavily armed vehicles in the form of the Land Raider.But the Guard equivalent of a Land Raider is one of that various Baneblade patterns, which is—again—slower, tougher, and better armed.Sure, they’re rare, but so are Land Raiders; a whole chapter would be lucky to have five. (What about things like the space marine Felllblade, you ask? Well, nobody knows how to make those anymore, whereas Baneblades, while rare,If you’re about to object that a Land Raider isn’t really aOf course, this is all by design. Roboute Guilliman specifically wrote the Codex Astartes to neuter the overall combat power of the space marine legions by breaking them up into tiny little thousand-man chapters. They’re very capable commando formations, but they’re not an army. Even the ones who specialize in things thatWhich is precisely why—classically speaking, anyway—they operate only light tanks like the Predator and infantry fighting vehicles.But that just flips the question on its head: whyThe answer to that, like a lot of 40K lore questions, really comes down to a scale beyond that of the tabletop—even beyond that which can be adequately represented by large-scale versions of the game like Apocalypse. 40K lore doesn’t actually make a lot of sense unless you imagine a scale of game in whichA lot of players object that space marines are inadequately represented on the tabletop in the name of play balance, such that space marine players take what would be crippling losses even when they win a scenario. And to some extent that’s true, but the bigger issue is that standard 40K tabletop games require equal, or at least aAnd that, of course, is not how space marines fight.It’s not the wayAgain, there’s nothing space marine-y about that. That’s howA force’s ability to achieve local superiority is dependent upon their ability to move combat power around the battlefield. Let’s go back to those 2,000 points of space marines against 2,000 points of something else. How do the space marinesAgain, this is all basic stuff. If you want to fight efficiently, you’ve got to be able to move large amounts of combat power around the battlefield,WhatBut it’s not just the speed of the light tanks that increases space marine mobility. It’s the fact that theyThis is where the tabletop, and even Apocalypse, really kind of drops the ball (unless you’re playing an Apocalypse game with a stupendously big footprint). Because space marine tanks can beYou can’t do this with a Leman RussAnd that’s a really big deal, or it’sThis mobility is the real reason space marines field the tanks they do. Sure, their tanks are light and comparatively lightly armed. But they canAs the old saying goes, a tank in the Transporter claws is worth two in the bush.Addendum: Okay, so … what about primaris marines? After all,And yeah, they do. But the reason for that is that Roboute Guilliman is, well, kind of a techno-snob. He wanted an army to lead in a new Crusade, and because he’s Guilliman, he figured a million new-model space marines was somehow the best way to do that.Not, you know, upgrading the vastly larger army he alreadyYou know, the ones he had broken up into tiny little commando chapters specifically so that theyLook, all of the Primarchs have their blind spots.

9,"In lore, not sure in game, marines have much faster reflexes and sharper senses than ordinary humans, making them better at it, and I imagine it’s also partially a holdover from the great crusade, when the astartes legions were line troops rather than special forces, with the Imperial Army supporting them rather than the other way around.
