At that time, there were many pro-American factions within the CCP, not only within the Party but also quite a few intellectuals outside the Party who supported the United States.If Obama is given another eight years, it is really possible that China will be exterminated by the United States. This practice is very clever. The United States did not invade China, but the United States keeps exporting values to China, which will constantly subvert the Chinese people's views on the Communist Party and the Chinese government. Similar to the color revolution.In China, the pro-American faction has a special name called ""public intellectuals""（公知）, which is a neutral word in itself, but many pro-American people call themselves ""public intellectuals"", and now this group is almost equal to the treason group in China. At first, it was regarded as the light of civilization, but now it is regarded as a traitor to treason.But don't underestimate the pro-Americans. Many of them are rich, hold important positions in China, and have contacts with the United States. They are really likely to subvert the country. After Trump took office, Trump's successive trade wars and scientific and technological wars against China strengthened the Chinese Communist Party's determination to resist the United States and strengthened the Chinese people's determination. The former pro-Americans have become people abandoned by the times.* Trump forced China to embark on the road of further industrial localizationOnce China didn't have many high-tech products, so it could only complete basic assembly. With the development of China, China has continuously increased the research and development of high-tech products. But Trump sees the danger that China may bring. Therefore, various restrictions and attacks were imposed on Chinese enterprises. Trade war and science and technology war started three years ago.If it weren't for Trump's fierce offensive, Chinese enterprises would still have illusions about the US government. It is precise because of the various unequal treaties listed by Trump that Chinese enterprises have further realized the ideas of the US government. Now all Chinese enterprises regard the core technology as their life and are determined to overcome it. The idea of Chinese enterprises has been supported by the CPC and the Chinese people. It is very difficult to tackle technical problems, but abandoning fantasy to tackle technical problems will surely succeed one day.* Trump and Pompeo constantly confronted China on Hong Kong and Taiwan issues, which accelerated China's management of Hong Kong and now accelerated the process of China's unification of Taiwan by force.Former American politicians are very talented people.First of all, they know that Hong Kong and Taiwan issues are the core issues of China, and secondly, they know that Hong Kong and Taiwan issues can become a bargaining chip against China when necessary.China also knows what the US government thinks.Therefore, instead of taking over Hong Kong substantively, the CCP has given Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. This is because the United States does not confront China on the Hong Kong issue. Before Trump took office, the CCP did not accelerate the deterioration of the Taiwan issue. On the contrary, before that, the CCP was vigorously promoting cross-strait exchanges. As the United States, they admit the fact of one China, but they have a vague attitude on the issues of Hong Kong and Taiwan in private. This practice is used to check and balance China.The American model once made it very difficult for China. On the one hand, the Chinese government cannot completely realize reunification. On other hand, patience is the only way to exchange for friendly relations between China and the United States. Only China-US friendship can promote China's construction and development. The United States is also very smart. On the one hand, it uses Hong Kong and Taiwan to check and balance China; on the other hand, its friendly relationship with China can also benefit the United States.But Trump broke the balance when he came to power. Trump underestimated the CCP's bottom line on Hong Kong and Taiwan issues. Trump believes that as long as China is completely suppressed, China will definitely bow its head. If Trump doesn't do this, maybe China will really bow its head.It's like if you want to kill 10 people, the best way is to threaten them with guns and say, ""You kill each other, and the last one who survives will not be killed"". At this time, these ten people will kill each other. If you point a gun at 10 people and say, ""I will kill you."" The final result may be 10 people pouncing on you and killing you.China is a nation with strong patience. As long as the Chinese can live, they will not riot easily. But if the Chinese can't stand it, there will be an uncontrollable counterattack.After Trump broke this tacit understanding and consensus. China can't endure any longer.First of all, China promulgated the National Security Law in Hong Kong. Now Hong Kong is an isolated island. All those who tried to make Hong Kong independent were all trapped in Hong Kong. Because Hong Kong is surrounded by Chinese territory, airspace, and territorial waters. The CCP can arrest these peopl...",0 followers,Ezio Yao,788,209,5.9M,https://www.quora.com/Does-China-prefer-Donald-Trump-in-2020

5,"I think so. But Chinese government can’t say so to avoid ‘interfering’ with US election. If you look at Chinese social media’s posts, you might conclude that contradicts to my assessments because there are a lot of anti-Trump’s talks due to his attacks on China like China virus. The key question for China is will (a) the rise of China inevitably leads to US’s containment? or (b) US recognize the complexities of US & China’s relationships are both competitive and cooperative and engage accordingly?I think Xi prefers non-confrontational scenario (b) but is preparing for (a).

As the negative views of China continue to grow in US, it looks like (a) is inevitable. With a cold war type of relationship, it unfortunately becomes a zero-sum game. In that case, I believe China would rather pay the short terms price in exchange for long terms success. The following are my reasons why China favors 4 more years of Donald Trump:(1) Republicans vs. Democrats(2) Transactional vs. Ideological BasePeople may disagree with my arguments by pointing out that Trump actually imposes tough sanctions against China high tech companies like Huawei and SMIC. That is the the same contraction when he favors relationship with Putin while impose tough sanctions on Russia. My opinion is that there are China hawks in Trump’s administration like Wilbur Ross, John Bolton or Peter Navarro believe in tech cold war to contain China. Trump is taking advantage of those sanctions as bargaining chips. A good example is Trump commented that he could intervene in the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou if it helps the trade deal negotiation. He does not care that implies US is holding hostage for ransom money! To Trump, he does not think of moral principles much. If a deal is good enough, he can let go those sanctions.(3) Trump’s Pacifism(4) Damage to Global Alliance RelationshipsThe hardline former Trump’s National Security Adviser, John Bolton, recently said in an interview that he is not going to vote for Trump. I am not a fan of Bolton, but he said 4 more years of Trump will do so much more damage to US alliance relationship to the point of irreversible.(5) Leaving Multi-Lateral organizationsTrump withdraw from TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) which is a free-trade zone that specifically excludes China. Trump does not believe in free trade and he probably does not understand Obama’s China containment strategy either. Then he withdraws from WHO in the middle of pandemic crisis which makes no sense to anyone. The withdraw from Paris accord makes China becoming the climate change leader. He actively undermines WTO, NATO and UN to the point that US is consistently out voted on issues related to China. Trump’s actively leaving or undermining multi-lateral organizations is becoming a perfect gift to China.Conclusions",1 follower,Mary Lynch,1.5K,7.2K,11.4M,https://www.quora.com/Does-China-prefer-Donald-Trump-in-2020

9,"China didn’t ask for this trade war, Trump started it so that he could appear tough, but it backfired for several reasons. First, he’s an idiot who doesn’t read or do research and never listens to his advisers except Stephen Miller. Mr. Art of the Deal started imposing tariffs on Chinese goods without realizing that to force them into a trade deal he needed leverage. He already pulled out of the TPP which lost us about a dozen countries who would have stood with us against China’s unfair trade practices, and he didn’t seem to know that the US is more reliant on China than China is on the US.

He already pulled out of the TPP which lost us about a dozen countries who would have stood with us against China’s unfair trade practices, and he didn’t seem to know that the US is more reliant on China than China is on the US. We outsource a good chunk of our labor to China, but a lot of the goods they were buying from us can be imported from other countries without the tariffs. Trump’s administration is filled with incompetent sycophants, President Xi’s government may be ruthless, but far from incompetent. They knew exactly what retaliatory tariffs would hurt Trump’s voters the most, so they went after the agricultural industry. Farmers lost their soybean market and their other commodity exports are down 40%. Even if a trade deal was reached, China wouldn’t go back to buying US goods at the same volume as before the trade war. Trump has to worry about reelection, among other things, President Xi doesn’t. It’s unusual for a GOP administration to oppose free trade, but like I said before, Trump is an idiot. China can wait this out until a mentally stable president represents the US, which shouldn’t be too far away, but the damage caused by Trump’s trade war may be permanent for farmers.Imagine growing up on a farm that’s been in your family for generations. Imagine working on that farm since you were a kid and continuing to work on it as an adult knowing that as long as the weather doesn’t get too bad, your hard work will be rewarded come harvest time. Then imagine Trump starting a trade war with our biggest trading partner and because of retaliatory tariffs, it would cost Chinese importers 15–25% more to buy your goods. You can lower your prices and say goodbye to most of your profits or have no market to sell your goods to. Chinese importers don’t really care if they get their soybeans from you or Brazil or Russia, they’ll go wherever they can get a better deal for the same quality product. Now imagine the money from the subsidies is running out because you used it to maintain your farm, the bills are piling up, and you have no other source of income. Eventually you may have to sell the farm that your grandparents used to work on because Trump is an idiot.

Trump has not done such friendly measures with China and has used a blunt tariff strategy in opposition with China. This was countered with a well placed tit-for-tat strategy by China targeting Trump’s voting base.His policies have appeared to be erratic and unreasonable towards China by other G8 countries, as evidenced by an overall European sympathy for China’s stable, rational foreign policy measures and economic partnerships. European response overall has been towards common strategic alignment on policy regarding China, without sidetracking either the US or China, as well as hoping US-China tensions do not increase.Although Biden’s political campaign has focused on being as tough or tougher on China, his prior track record during his time as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and leading Senate’s efforts to have China join the World Trade Organization would suggest this as a 180 degrees departure from his previous history (not that Trump hasn’t done 180 degrees departures before - he used to be a Democrat).

They know because of changing demographics in the US and the willingness of the younger Americans to embrace socialism have resulted in a political war that has accelerated the slide to an avalanche. They believe the winner will be the ever more aggressive progressive socialist left and the looser will be the conservative American that built America who will become irrelevant.They know no future president will ever have the will power or be stronge enough to take the punishment they will face if they chose to challenge the progressive left not that they ever would be inclined to. They will be most likely minority presidents who will spend our remaining wealth on internal socialistic programs, certainly not the military, and will not focus at all on worldly affairs.So China sees their future as the leader of the world because of Trumps last gasp presidency that will result is a US that will be irrelevant in the world in the near future.",0 followers,Bill Leidy,2.8K,1.2K,3.5M,https://www.quora.com/Does-China-prefer-Donald-Trump-in-2020

So if you observe a light wave from your couch or from an airplane or from a spaceship, it will always be traveling at the same speed relative to you. This result was counter-intuitive, since according to Newtonian physics, the speed you are moving at should impact the observed velocity of what you are observing, eg your tv might appear stationary from your couch, but to someone traveling 300 mph in a plane above, the tv looks like it's moving backward at 300 mph.The only consistentThe Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 showed that light has the same speed regardless of your reference frame.

So it's not that we know for sure that nothing can travel faster than light, it's that the best theory we have for predicting physical behavior at high speeds yields results that are very difficult to interpret at speeds above c, and that no one has yet observed any object moving faster than c. That's not to say that tomorrow someone couldn't measure something moving faster than c, and we would have to re-evaluate our prevailing physical theories.",201 followers,Max Williams,3.1K,1.4K,3M,https://www.quora.com/Does-China-prefer-Donald-Trump-in-2020

The equations had no way to account for the motion of the observer—they seemed to say that no matterParallel to all this physicists had been trying to learn more about light, and the prevailing theory by the mid to late 1800s was that light was a wave, and based on what they knew about waves, they were starting to come up with all sorts of weird hypotheses about light and the medium that was hypothesized to transmit it. (What we knew about waves was that they needed aThe medium postulated to transmit light was called theBy the late 19th century experimentalists were performing experiments that should have been able to measure the aether as the Earth moves through it, but their experiments kept coming up empty. The most famous is theMeanwhile, in 1905, Einstein published hisSpecial relativity showed that as one approaches the speed of light (relative to another observer) the energy required to accelerate further increasesSo Alice and Bob get fed up with each other and decide they're going to have a duel with tachyon pistols. The rules are thus: Each duelist will board his or her superadvanced spaceship and, on the count of three, accelerate away from each other for ten seconds. They will then turn (without stopping, that's an important technicality), and fire their tachyon pistols at each other.Alice, filled to the brim with loathing for Bob, boards her spaceship and waits for the count. One … two … three and she's off at some substantial fraction of speed of light. She counts down ten seconds, turns and fires at Bob.But since Bob and Alice have been receding from each other at high speed, Bob is time dilated in Alice's frame of reference. So when her clock says ten seconds have elapsed, only five seconds have elapsed for Bob. When she fires her magic instantaneous tachyon pistol, it hits Bob's spaceship when his clock reads five seconds.Enraged that Alice fired early, Bob turns and shoots right back at her. But since they've been receding from each other at high speed, Alice is time-dilated in Bob's frame. So when he fires at the instant his clock reads five seconds, only two and a half seconds have elapsed for Alice. Bob's aim is better than Alice's, so his shot hits her spaceship and kills her … seven-and-a-half seconds before she fired the shot that caused Bob to shoot her back.Faster-than-light anything and causality cannot coexist.Now the thing is, you’ll recall at the beginning of this answer I was specific aboutIn 1935 Einstein published a paper in collaboration with Podolsky and Rosen (the famous EPR paper), which at the time they thought was a nail in a coffin for quantum mechanics.

It means light coming at you from a flashlight you aim at yourself, and light coming from a flashlight moving at nearly the speed of light itself, BOTH move at c. So does light emitted from a flashlight moving away from you at nearly c. That’s remarkable! And it lets us do a thought experiment.You want to move at c. You get into your rocket and you fly along a laser fired from earth (obviously moving at c relative to you when you took off). You accelerate up to 0.5c, and measure again… but c is always c. The laser is still moving away from you at c! You get annoyed and accelerate up to .99c relative to earth. STILL the laser light seems to move away from you at c. You realize you’ll never catch it. You’ll never even get fail to catch up to it LESS. It will always be moving away from you at c, because c is the speed limit of the universe, the speed of massless things.So how could an observer on earth see you moving at .99c, nearly as fast as the light, but you see it moving away from you like you’re standing still? Simple. speed is distance divided by time. Since the speed is always c, but if light is moving less distance away from you per unit time as observed from earth, time must be slowing down in proportion.So if you go to 0.99999c, and earth sees photons just barely inching away from your ship, and you see them zipping away at c, it’s because time has slowed down immensely for you.",0 followers,Ron Brown,711,8.6K,36.8M,https://www.quora.com/Does-China-prefer-Donald-Trump-in-2020

It was so much fun to create small command line programs and implement various algorithms. In my opinion, C is great to understand the concept of programming and C++ for OOP. These two are such great languages for systems programming and I wouldn’t be wrong in saying without C, there is no operating system.However when it comes to web based applications level programming, I find some qualities of C/C++ to have significant scopes of improvement:1. Low level-ness - both C and C++ are compiled directly into machine level code as binaries unlike Java which compiles to bytecode and C# to MSIL, which makes them runnable on any machine on any OS. But portability is way harder across operating systems for C/C++ because every machine is different and so you need have binaries compiled for specific hardware and OS which is cumbersome. For example, you need to think whether your code is POSIX compliant. Just because it works on Windows doesn’t mean it works on Mac/Linux.2. Lack of an industry grade 3-tier stack (framework)- this is probably the top reason why C/C++ is not used much in web development. J2EE and Spring are just two of the many stacks built to code with Java. With jsp for front end, Java for business layer and jdbc for database operations in J2EE, similarly ASP for web pages , C# for business layer and ADO for database ops in dotnet framework, Django for Python, Rails for Ruby, MEAN and MERN for javascript, there isn’t one for C/C++. So you would end up building the components first before you build the tool.3. Syntax - I particularly found c++ to be overwhelmingly detailed about the syntax - you have to be pretty careful with a single space sometimes. As you dig deeper, you will get to know when string is better than const char* and vice versa.4. Playing with pointers - if you grew up with C++, you would be either super happy that you have control over an exact memory address or quite confused about generous usage of pointers. You could easily crash your app if you missed an asterisk (*) because the memory address you needed vs the one you de-referenced to would be different altogether.one more because, well… pointers!5.
