We have exactly zero working fusion plants. The ITER Tokamak is most likely to succeed in creating sustained fusion. It has a million components, might light up in 2040 and the million components include no electrical generation bits. When you have something so complex that it has a million components, the odds of it ever being economically viable in any earthbound generation perspective is vanishingly unlikely.After that, we get to the one GW. Nuclear reactors ended up standardizing around a GW for a variety of reasons, but mostly because that was a useful scale for boiling water to generate electricity. There were some smaller ones and some bigger ones, but the likelihood is that if we ever get fusion working economically to generate electricity, it will end up being in that scale. At 90% capacity factor, the nuclear industry average, it would generate about 7.9 TWh in a year, so that’s okay. There are about 450 nuclear reactors running in the 30 countries that built them generating around 10% of the electricity we currently use, so one fusion reactor would produce about 0.02% of the electricity we use globally.As for the all of it model, we have a really amazing fusion reactor parked ‘nearby’. It’s actually 93 million miles away and it’s just sitting there bathing the world in free energy every day. Without it, the Earth would be a lifeless ball floating in space. We can capture the energy it sends us with incredibly cheap solar panels, and we’ve built about 3 billion ...","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-energy-would-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-hypothetically-produce-How-much-is-it-in-comparison-to-total-global-energy-consumption-today

How much will it cost to operate the plant? How much to maintain it? How much to retire it when it has completed its useful life? There is no free lunch.The myth that other technologies plummet in cost in the same way as computers ignores the laws of physics, chemistry and engineering. Yes, the computer I used in college, which filled a room and cost millions. That computer cannot hold a shadow on the computer I am using now. That was a 32 bit, 2 MHz IBM System 360/40 with 32K memory. This is an Intel with 4 64 bit processors operating at 2.5 GHz, with 16 GB of memory sitting on my desk. This computer cost about 2,000 dollars.In the 1950’s nuclear fission generation was SOLD with the representation it would be too cheap to meter. That was based solely on the really low cost of fuel. Even now the fuel cost is less than 2 cents per kilowatt hour. But the rest of the costs are from 30 to 50 cents in addition to the fuel. The plants started at 2 Billion/Milliard dollars, then 4, then 6, and for the 4 units the Obama Administration conned the utilities in Georgia and South Carolina, 8 and still rising, while the general contractor has bankrupted.For a short time I had a temporary job for Diablo Canyon with 2 units. When proposed they were supposed to cost 2 Billion each. By the time they went into production they cost more than 3 each, and then about 2 Billion more for the 3 rate cases to put them in the power bills through the California Public Service Commission, Rate Case, Son of Rate Case, Grandson of Rate Case, about 2 Billion dollars added and paid by the customers.[In some countries, such as the US, a Billion is 1000 Million. In others because a Milliard is 1000 Million, Billion is a Million Million. My Billion follows the US convention.]","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-energy-would-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-hypothetically-produce-How-much-is-it-in-comparison-to-total-global-energy-consumption-today

Once you have a reactor you can use neutron bombardment to make Plutonium 239 from Uranium 238 (the rest of natural uranium, called depleted uranium after processing). U238 is known as a fertile material. Thorium 232 is also fertile. It produces Uranium 233 when bombarded. Thorium is more abundant than Uranium, and U233 is not especially good at making bombs out of, so people have proposed using Thorium as the next big power source for that reason. People who build atomic bombs don’t particularly like the idea of shutting down power plants that could make bombs easily if need be. Reactors that convert fertile materials into fissile materials are called Breeder Reactors.Think of gathering wood for a fire in a rain storm. Some of the wood is dry most is wet. You carefully sort through the wet stuff in your tent and pull out the dry. You start a fire. You then stack the wet wood around the fire, and dry it. Same idea here except instead of heat and water, we use neutrons and nucleii.All release 82 trillion joule range per kilogam.So, dividing 5.528*10^20 Joules by 82*10^12 Joules/kg obtains 6,471.46 tonnes per year of Uranium.Japanese researchers have worked out how to extract Uranium from the oceans, and that should be enough to build large nuclear power plants on the oceans that fuel themselves. Wastes can be processed by plasma extraction and a lot of them can be used in medicines and secondary power sources. That’s better than throwing them away mixed in with non radioactive materials. Anything radioactive could be blasted with a laser, the materials separated isotopically, and the pure materials used in a wide range of ways safely. In the end by the time we’re done with it, its less radioactive than the stuff we started with, we put it in a glass brick and drop it in a trench in the ocean.Westinghouse developed a high temperature sulphur iodine process that breaks water down into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be used to make carbon dioxide into carbon (coal) methane (natural gas) and octane (oil). It can also be burned. This process is 50% efficient. So, to make enough hydrogen requires 13,942.92 tonnes per year of Uranium to make enough hydrogen to replace all the fossil fuels we use. Since were extracting Uranium from sea water we can use the waste heat to make fresh water enough for everyone.Fusion reactors have been built. They’re called hydrogen bombs. They consist of Lithium-6 which is 7.5% of all naturally occurring Lithium. Lithium-7 is the balance - and Deuterium also known as Hydrogen-2 with an extra neutron. 1 in 3180 hydrogen atoms is Deuterium on Earth. As in the case of Uranium there is enough Lithium-6 and Deuterium dissolved in the ocean to keep a fusion reaction running using this process - called the Jetter Cycle after Ulrich Jetter who discovered it in 1947. In 1952 the first Hydrogen Bomb was detonated. The process remains secret largely but we start with neutrons bombarding Lithium-6 and that makes energetic tritium along with helium. That tritium hits deuterium and makes helium and you get your neutron back. So basically you put lithium-6 deuteride into a molten salt reactor and mix it with stuff like Beryllium that makes neutrons from alpha particles and Boron that makes alpha particles from neutrons and you have a nice little reactor without high temperatures and pressures. This was rumoured to be one of the products of Project Sherwood back in the 1950s. Though that is not open right now.Of course we can use hot fusion techniques to fuse Lithium6 and Deuterium as well.207.156 trillion joules of energy are released for each 750 grams of Lithium 6 and 250 grams of Deuterium. So,5.528*10^20/207.156*10^12 = 2668.52 tonnes per year. Double this to make hydrogen as before and fresh water. Self fuelled from the ocean. Waste product is helium. No long lived actinides to process — also no nuclear medicines, radioisotope generators and other useful things — so I see a mix of reactors being most beneficial.100 floating platforms off the coast of every country, begin opration. 20 of them are fission. 80 of them are fusion. Each 360 GW. They have a hydrogen powered tunnel boring machines that dig underground from off shore, and connect every city on Earth.

National City Lines [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy ] - Phillips Petroleum and General Motors colluded to buy up the tram lines and interurban lines across America and run them out of business in order to sell more motorcars. Studies done at the time showed that 2/3 of post war America would never buy cars if they had easy access to street cars and interurban for less cost. They also showed that electrically driven trams powered by power lines running over the tracks would always be less expensive than individual motorcars with complex internal combustion engines. The investment in and crashing of the tram and interurban system of the USA would triple auto and fuel sales and was well worth the losses incurred.On Nov 1, 1952, the US Atomic Energy Commission in conjunction with the US Department of Defence detonated the first hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike [ https://youtu.be/h7vyKDcSTaE ].This bomb used lithium-6 and deuterium to promote the Jetter Cycle. [ https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdf ] Here neutron flux was used to convert Lithium-6 to Tritium and Helium releasing 4.8 MeV of energy. The energetic Tritium scattered off the Lithium-6 remaining and fused readily with the Deuterium producing another alpha particle (Helium) and an energetic neutron. The neutron can interact with any of a variety of heavy nuclei to produce many more slow neutrons to create a large reaction from a small spark.By March 1, 1954 a ‘dry’ hydrogen bomb was detonated, Castle Bravo [ https://youtu.be/b5tmkna-k-U ]. Here the system was made very compact and easier to build.By 1956 a ‘fission free’ hydrogen bomb billed at the ‘Humanitarian H-bomb” because of its lack of radioactive fall out which used only lithium-6 deuterium was built.At that time people wondered if it might be possible to build tiny fission free ‘nuclear hand grenades [ http://media.restraint.org/2009/03/fusion_microcapsule.jpg ]’ that would be detonated in a thrust chamber to produce rocket thrust for a massive interplanetary rocket [ https://youtu.be/xYoLcJuBtOw ], others wondered if it might be possible to contain the jet of plasma in such a way to produce electricity directly using MHD with these inertial confinement [ https://www.nap.edu/read/18288/chapter/4 ] units.By 1954 Lewis Strauss, Atomic Energy Commission chair, reported to the public on the results of classified research associated with Project Sherwood a wide ranging study of fusion technology. Princeton University had looked into hot fusion under this program using their Stellarator. Being unclassified it was widely reported in the press.Meanwhile, weapons labs had looked at Lithium-6 Deuteride with a neutron multiplier like Zinc-64 that took a long time to undergo a (n,2n) reaction, so could not be made into an explosive but could sustain a continuous reaction.

The area of the brain that got damaged in Gage’s case was the left frontal lobe. He did however have major personality changes. He was ill-tempered, proliferous in his use of profanity, no longer stuck with plans, and treated others poorly. Gage’s friends found him “no longer Gage”.Image:Image: Images in clinical medicine. The tale of Phineas Gage, digitally remastered.Removing parts of the brain does not result in the consequences we expect. The brain has an amazing ability to rewire itself to perform completely different tasks when necessary. Bradley Schlaggar, a pediatric neurologist, transplanted the visual cortex from an embryonic rat’s brain into the brain of a newborn rat, in the area of the somatosensory cortex (responsible for such bodily sensations as pressure and temperature). Once the rat was an adult, autopsy revealed that the transplanted visual cortex was operating as the somatosensory cortex.Leah Krubitzer, a professor of psychology, performed a different experiment which demonstrated this amazing ability of the brain. She removed large pieces of brain in newborn marsupials. Autopsy of the marsupial adults revealed their brains had adjusted by creating the identical structures, in the same areas as a normal brain, but they were smaller so as to fit into the tinier space.Left and Right Brain HemispheresSo let’s start with removing a hemisphere (half the brain). It is hard to believe that we can even live with half a brain. However Elena del Peral does and unless she told you she had half a brain you would not know. She is a friendly, bright, fit young woman who attends college and works at a childhood cancer foundation and is on the dean’s list.Image:In utero she suffered a left-sided congenital stroke. She was diagnosed because she began to suffer severe seizures due to the fact that the diseased tissue from her left hemisphere was sending electric storms across her corpus callosum (the part of the brain that allows for left and right hemisphere communication). The doctors decided to perform a hemisphectomy (removing half of her brain).So what does the research tell us about removing half a brain? Studies of intelligence and behaviour were made before, and after hemispherectomy for infantile hemiplegia. Results showed that patients made gains in intelligence after loss of half of the brain, however behavioural changes occurred and remained consistent over many years.Image source: www.cartoonaday.comRight Hemispheric DamageLeft Hemispheric DamageSo let’s look at damage or removal at some of the major parts of the brain:Cerebral CortexThe cerebral cortex is the outer layer of tissue that covers the cerebrum (the part of the brain that includes the frontal, occipital, temporal and parietal lobes). It is composed of grey matter (mostly cell bodies), as opposed to the white matter below it (myelin sheaths of neuronal axons). It is highly folded, resulting in a much greater volume of the brain surface area in the confined volume of the skull. The corpus callosum (a thick band of nerves) connects the right and left cerebral cortex sides.Below are images of the lateral and medial areas of the cerebral cortex.Image: Lateral surface of the cerebral cortexThe cerebral cortex is responsible for most “higher order” or intellectual brain functions: thinking, reasoning, judging, planning, voluntary movement, and overall behavior.Injury to this area of the brain impairs judgment, dramatically changes personality, and results in problems with behavioural inhibition, focus and attention.Image: Medial surface of the cerebral cortexThe cortex has three distinct parts:Thus damage or loss of this particular area of the brain results in specific losses associated with the area of the cortex described above.ASource: London Natural History Museum:Cerebral Cortex FunctionsCerebral Cortex Injury ProblemsFrontal lobe:Image courtesy:The frontal lobe is responsible for helping us understand the thinking and experiences of others, and helping a person understand how to respond and behave appropriately in social situations. In autism and chronic post traumatic stress disorder the highway between the limbic system and the frontal lobe does not function properly. This results in a weak theory of mind for autistics, and an inability to process and let go of the trauma for people with PTSD.Image: James FallonThe frontal lobe has been divided into “cool” cognitive aspects of executive functions, (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and the “hot” emotional/motivational aspects, (ventral and medial regions).Damage to the the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex results in disturbances in intellectual abilities (intelligence) such as problems in time-line sequencing of behaviour, problem solving challenges, problems in planning, and working memory defects (known as metacognitive executive dysfunction syndrome).Damage to the ventro-medial region results in impairment in being able to inhibit impulses— both emotions and behaviour.Image:Damage or removal of this area of the brain is known as Dysexecutive syndrome. This results in deficits in recognizing facial and vocal emotional expression (which supports the weak Theory of Mind in people with autism spectrum disorder).Furthermore, executive skills are reduced. For example, research has looked at set-shifting ability in neurosurgical patients with localized excisions of the frontal lobes. The patients had a deficit in the ability to shift their attention from something that had previously commanded their attention, or to move to something which had previously been irrelevant.Frontal Lobe FunctionsFrontal Lobe Injury ComplicationsTemporal LobeImage courtesy:A temporal lobe resection is a surgery performed on the brain to control seizures. The procedure involves removing brain tissue in the lobe to remove the seizure focus. Most often the anterior and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are involved.Kolb & Wishaw (1990) have identified eight principle symptoms of temporal lobe damage:Occipital LobesImage courtesy:Located at the back of the brain—and thus are not particularly vulnerable to injury—the occipital lobes receive and process visual information. The occipital lobes also process colours and shapes. Whereas the right occipital lobe interprets images from the left visual space, the left occipital lobe interprets images from the right visual space. Damage to the occipital lobes can permanently damage visual perception.The Peristriate region of the occipital lobe is involved in visuospatial processing, discrimination of movement, and color discrimination.Occipital Lobe FunctionsOccipital Lobe Injury ComplicationsParietal LobesImage courtesy:The parietal lobes can be divided into two functional regions:Individuals with damage to the parietal lobes often show striking deficits, such as abnormalities in body image and spatial relations. Parietal lobe damage disrupts shape, size and color identification, and distance perception.Left parietal lobeRight parietal lobeBi-lateral damageSpecial deficits (primarily to memory and personality) can occur if there is damage to theLeft parietal-temporalTheParietal Lobe FunctionsParietal Lobe Injury ComplicationsCerebellumImage courtesy:Known as the ‘little brain’, it manages movement (but does not initiate it), maintain posture and balance. It also controls fucntions like attention and language and the regulation of the fear and pleasure responses. It receives information from the sensory systems, spinal cord, and other parts of the brain, and uses it to coordinate movements. It allows a person to perform rapid and repetitive movements like running.You can live without a cerebellum. Some rare conditions exist calledCerebellar hypoplasiaCerebellar agenesis:Cerebellum Brain FunctionsCerebellum Injury ProblemsBrainstemImage courtesy:The brainstem is connected to the spinal cord, and is responsible for controls unconscious functions (respiration, digestion, and pulse). Three structures comprise the brainstem: the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The midbrain controls eye movement and focus. The pons sends signals back and forth between the cerebrum and cerebellum. The medulla oblongata controls respiration, blood pressure, pulse rate, and digestion.The brainstem is responsible for vital survival functions,thus damage is often fatal. People who survive brainstem injury usually require assistance with simple physical functions like breathing and regulating pulse.Brainstem FunctionsBrainstem Injury ProblemsSource:The Limbic system is primarily responsible for our emotional life, and has a lot to do with the formation of memories.Limbic SystemDamage to the Limbic system may cause:Corpus CallosumThe Corpus Callosum is the area of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres. It was well know due to Split Brain Syndrome, where it was cut to prevent severe epilepsy. Damage to the area interrupts the steady flow of information between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. When cut it prevent the left hand from knowing what the right hand is doing and visa versa.And just for fun, you can test your self.

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble?
