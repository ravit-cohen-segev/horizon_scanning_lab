1,"It can't be done. It has almost no plot, little characterization, and almost no dialog. Any effort to fiddle with them would just detract. The movie is an extravaganza of cinematography, and since Kubrick has already done it, there's no point in doing it again.","7,266 followers",Ken Fishkin,564,1.9K,12.8M,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-super-computer-like-HAL-as-shown-in-2001-A-Space-Odyssey-exist-in-real-life
2,"According to Wikipedia:HAL's name, according to writer Arthur C. Clarke, is derived from Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer. After the film was released, fans noticed HAL was a one-letter shift from the name IBM and there has been much speculation since then that this was a dig at the large computer company, something that has been denied by both Clarke and 2001 director Stanley Kubrick.

As it happened, IBM had given us a good deal of help, so we were quite embarrassed by this, and would have changed the name had we spotted the coincidence.""IBM was consulted during the making of the film and their logo can be seen on props in the film including Pan Am Clipper's cockpit instrument panel and on the lower arm keypad on Poole's space suit. During production it was brought to IBM's attention that the film's plot included a homicidal computer but they approved association with the film if it was clear any ""equipment failure"" was not related to their products.","45,920 followers",Steven Haddock,691,25.5K,341.8M,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-super-computer-like-HAL-as-shown-in-2001-A-Space-Odyssey-exist-in-real-life
3,"No. Don't touch it - it's already a masterpiece. Some films just shouldn't be remade, and that includes any directed by Kubrick.CGI would only make it look dated in a few years, whereas the effects shots of the original still look like the future.","2,740 followers",Kieran Begu,551,161,11.3M,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-super-computer-like-HAL-as-shown-in-2001-A-Space-Odyssey-exist-in-real-life
