3,"As Caulley Johnson stated, the answer is “no”. When I was a nuclear engineering student, one of my professors stated that commercial fusion power is at least 50 years away. Nearly 40 years have passed since that time, and I still believe it would be 50 years away, though quite a bit of progress has been made. The leap from fusion experiments to commercial production is pretty big. Some of the materials used are not available in huge quantities, such as Beryllium, so coming up with containment materials in commercial quantities may take more effort.The larger part is two-fold.

One is providing designs that need to be approved by a country’s nuclear regulating agency, which can take many years. Second, the idea of unlimited power is, to be frank, “pie in the sky”. When nuclear power was first being used back in the 1950’s, the catch phrase was that nuclear power would make electricity so plentiful it would be “too cheap to meter”. This was also a “pie in the sky” statement. After all, electric utility companies are commercial, for profit businesses. They won’t stay in business for very long if they end up giving away the power they produce for free. Another piece is that an earth-based fusion reactor plant is not like the sun and would not be able to produce unlimited energy. The earth-bound fusion process has some similarities to the fusion process in the sun, but there are also quite a lot of differences, e.g. the temperatures needed to ignite fusion in a small fusion reactor on earth is significantly greater than on the sun. As Mr. Johnson notes, the cost of a commercial fusion reactor, at least initially, would be quite high, and I agree. Back in the early days of nuclear power in the US, you could build a 1000 MW(electric) nuclear power station for $300 million by the early 1970’s. Today, that price tag is $15 billion and counting. Plus, initially you get a 40 year operating license, so you have to pay off the initial investment plus all the costs of operating a nuclear station for 40 years and make a profit. In today’s market with cheap natural gas, and with many electricity markets in the US being deregulated (competition among electricity generators) building and operating a new nuclear power station is not economically feasible in much of the US. At this point, the same would be true of a commercial fusion power station, so finding a non-government company to build one would be difficult. And any project of this type to built by a government entity, frankly, would likely be poorly managed with massive cost overruns, legal suits, and end up like the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository and never get built, but will waste many 10’s of billions of tax dollars. This is a pessimistic, but realistic view.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-scope-for-nuclear-engineering-in-Australia-What-kind-of-nuclear-engineering-medicinel-or-anyother-Requirements-for-the-job-What-about-salary

9,"Probably not. Why? For the same reasons that Fukushima’s reactors failed: TEPCO**. Its corrupt, dishonest, and frankly incompetent management. They decided to put all the backup generators in the basement because it was cheaper to do so. This, even after they had been told *prior to* construction and had promised that they would *not* do so. They were fully aware of the problem of common mode failure, and still they chose to do so.

They also built a seawall which they knew was inadequate to handle a magnitude 9 quake. On the other hand, it is true that they believed that only an 8 was likely. Unfortunately, they ignored the fact that they were along a subduction fault. However, it is also true that they knew that it was statistically unlikely that they would get that magnitude quake right in a spot which could and would generate a 40-45 foot tsunami.The entire plant survived the quake just fine. The reactor scrammed just fine. Just exactly as GE had designed it to do. Problem was, they had a station blackout immediately because the outside power failed from the quake, thus they were immediately on their own internal power - with the diesel generators in the basement because the reactor had automatically scrammed. (It would have been better if it had just kept running. If even one reactor hadn't scrammed, they would all have survived.) That was fine until the wave struck, and flowed over the seawall like it wasn't even there (which, as a practical matter, it might just as well not have been), and then continued to flow, right into the basement - Duh. Diesel engines just aren't designed to work under water. End of emergency backup diesel-powered station power. Fortunately, they did have sufficient backup batteries to keep the coolant pumps running for 8 hours, sufficient to disperse most of the residual decay heat (the fission stopped when the reactors were scrammed, and the remaining heat was being caused by the decay of the fission daughter-products which were left over). Then they got into trouble. After the water in the parking lots subsided, they frantically went out and salvaged the batteries out of their cars so that they could at least run the instruments. Not enough to run the pumps, but at least they could do a few things. These guys (the station operators, NOT the TEPCO management) were truly heroes. BTW, not entirely surprisingly, they were also a bunch of electricians, too… so they knew how to hook up all those car batteries, etc.OK, that said, the very same managerial corruption, greed, and incompetence would still have led to an ineffectual seawall, and backup power failure for diesels which still would have been sequestered in the basement, etc. But what would have followed would have been totally different with a LFTR instead of the BWRs (also applies to PWRs).First, in BWRs and PWRs (Fukushima was all BWRs, a 1960′s design. Early and primitive, but very reliable unless something went catastrophically wrong… like a total station blackout w/o backup power….) you have solid fuel. The fuel pellets are stacked in a hollow rod made of Zircalloy, hence the term ‘fuel rods’. This is a Zirconium alloy which works very well in *very high* radiation environments. Unfortunately, when it gets very, very hot, and it is in contact with steam (don't ask why, too much to explain reactor dynamics here. Just accept that it was in contact with steam rather than water at assorted points), it reacts to form Zirconium Oxide and Hydrogen gas. Hence, you get large quantities of hydrogen gas, and it has to be vented from the reactor vessel because otherwise it pushes the water level lower, exposing more of the zircalloy to steam rather than water, making more hydrogen gas, etc. (Which is what happened at TMI, but they didn't detect it because a warning safety tag happened to cover up the red idiot light that was supposed to warn them that the water level was dropping too low…) And, for the exposed rods, steam can't cool them anywhere nearly as well as water, so they tend to *really* overheat, and the zircalloy, in addition to generating hydrogen gas with great abandon, melts. As does the, by now, very thermally hot fuel. Hence the term “Meltdown”. Oh, and BTW, at Fukushima, instead of venting the hydrogen up a pipe exiting the building and simply venting into the atmosphere (as they did at Three Mile Island, and yes, that meant that very small amounts of radioactivity was released, but a far better solution than keeping it in the building…), at Fukushima they merely vented it to the inside of the building. There it mixed with the nitrogen and oxygen in the air, and floated to the top of the building and accumulated. Anybody here remember the Hindenburg? Well, it eventually happened, and the roofs of the reactor buildings blew off. And, no, contrary to that breathless imbecile, Nancy Grace, they did NOT have a nuclear explosion. They had a hydrogen gas deflagration, which you may regard as basically a ‘gas explosion’, in effect, but it was actually not a detonation. Blew off the tops of the buildings and made a mess and complicated all sorts of stuff, but didn't, in and of itself, release any radioactives which had not already been vented.Meanwhile, back at the Thorium ranch, yes, they would have scrammed the reactor. Yes, they would have lost power. Yes, they would have run out of battery power; yes, they would have had to snatch the car batteries, etc.; but then what? Well, not much, actually:Worst case? Lets assume that somehow the reactor vessel failed - a great big split right down the side. The intensely radioactive molten salt leaks out the side. Assuming that it didn't congeal immediately and seal the leak (which is reasonably likely for smaller cracks which don't tear the vessel wide open), it would flow right down to the concrete catch basin below it, which drains right down into the cooling tank more or less directly below that. Where it cools and solidifies, and then sits there until they turn on the heaters and pump it back up into the <repaired/replaced> reactor vessel to restart it and resume power production.Most realistic case? Power failure. They are able to keep the fan on the drain pipe going and then at some time later, they restart it and go back to producing power … after they make whatever repairs are necessary, either locally for station power, or to the transmission lines out to the grid.Slightly worse case? They run out of power and the drain pipe fan/cooling stops. The salt plug in the pipe melts, and the molten salt fuel drains down into the drain tank and shortly solidifies. There it sits until they turn on the heaters and pump it back up into the reactor vessel to restart power production.Oh, you say, but what happens when the tsunami floods into the drain tank. After all, the drain tank has to be in the basement, and, well… right. The molten salt is denser than seawater, and drains down to the bottom of the drain tank where it solidifies and sits there until you turn on the heaters, etc., etc.But wait! Won't that contaminate the seawater and release it into the environment? Well, yes, to a very small degree. Much, much less than what has and is happening with Fukushima, but a little bit. Until it finishes solidifying. Did I mention that the solidified LFTR fuel salt is essentially insoluble in water? It’ll just sit there in the drain tank for the next million years or so, until the drain tank erodes away. So, you’ve got plenty of time to work on it… Anyway, back to our story: It sits there until you reheat it, etc. But, for a short time you would have boiling water on top of it which could carry off small amounts of radioactive salt mixture until the molten salt crusts over, which effectively either vastly reduces or simply terminates the erosion and carrying off of the salt by the steam produced. Not long thereafter, the entire charge solidifies and the residual heat (primarily from the fission byproducts, which decay fairly rapidly - typically within hours - days) dissipates and the whole chunk thermally cools. Still radioactively hot- some from the U-233 (generally pretty weak alpha, but a touch of beta decays) but more significantly, gamma from the U-232 (which emits pretty hot gamma). It is this gamma which makes it unsuitable for use in bombs. (By the time you isotopically extract the U-232 from the far more prevalent U-233, you can make your own bombs out of U-235 or Pu-239 much more easily.*** (Again, this isn't a treatise on nuclear particle / isotopic dynamics)So, still not pretty, but far, far less consequential than what happens with solid fuel reactors.Fukushima had two major problems which account for the disaster which it is. (Not to sugarcoat it…) : 1) really bad management at TEPCO, and 2) it was a solid fuel reactor. Even so, even with that, it would still have turned out just fine and would have long since been restarted and humming right along producing power but for #1. The reactor and associated equipment survived the quake and even the ensuing tsunami just fine. It was incompetent management at the top which doomed it to a meltdown by guaranteeing a common mode failure for *all* of the station emergency backup power generators. NASA and Westinghouse and GE spend inordinate amounts of time and lose lots of sleep at night trying to dream up and identify ever conceivable common-mode failure possible.Yes, that same management would have created severe problems with an MSR reactor, but with massively fewer consequences, all of far lesser import.NB: I am, in this response, assuming that you are referring to a LFTR - which is not merely a molten salt reactor, but is a molten fuel reactor. Technically, you could use molten salt as the coolant in a solid fuel reactor, and you could use solid Thorium or uranium or assorted MOXs as the fuel. Thus it would be a MSR, but the buzz is actually about fluid fuel reactors, which has the fuel in the form of a fluid. The typical proposal uses a FLiBe salt to contain the Thorium Fluoride salt which is fertile, and upon bombardment with thermal (as opposed to fast) neutrons, converts into Uranium-233 (after a few, relatively quick, intermediate steps), which is fissile and constitutes the actual ‘fuel’ because it is busy fissioning. The U-233 releases just sufficient neutrons when it decays to both fission another U-233 and to hit another Thorium, at the same time it is releasing the heat from that fission.** Tokyo Electric Power COmpanyFor a complete in-depth look at what happened at Fukushima Daiichi, go to:https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/iaeabooks/10962/the-fukushima-daiichi-accident*** Plutonium has much the same problem. U233 when utilized in a gun barrel bomb design, in which a sub-critical mass, say 20–30% of a critical mass is shot down what is essentially a gun barrel (works just fine for U235, and was the design used in Little Boy at Hiroshima) into a ‘pit’ of another sub-critical mass, say 80–70% of a critical mass, thus completing a critical mass when they plunge together, just doesn’t work very well. It tends to fizzle. So, instead of a ~20KT bomb, you get something that heats up very rapidly and blows itself apart before it can go critical. The problem is that even very small amounts of U232 contamination results in lots of neutrons buzzing around, which means that different parts of your mass are fissioning at different times, which heats things up quite nicely, thank you, with the result that the ‘bullet’ and the ‘pit’ start fissioning at different times which doesn’t give you a ‘good’ explosion. Instead, you get something which is equivalent to a dozen or so tons, not thousands of tons. So, your explosion covers only a small area. A good fertilizer truck bomb can do that, and do it for a lot less hassle. But, it would be dirty, so it would contaminate things, but it’s not going to blow up a city. Also, you would need a industrial strength processing plant to purify the U233 to separate out most of the U232. Takes lots of industry and lots of money. Incidentally, your U233 thieves are not going to be real happy about life because they got a whopping good dose of gamma, and probably aren’t feeling too well. Finally, you’d have to tune your reactor to produce very high grade U233 (ie, very pure with very low contamination of U232), which they simply won’t do in commercial reactors. Easily monitored, also.So, how to get around the problem? Same way you do with Plutonium - you build an implosion device. Remember Fat Man? The big spherical shaped plutonium bomb used on Nagasaki? Much more difficult to fabricate. A lot more difficult. You’re talking state actors, not common garden-variety terrorists. And by the time you’re talking state actors, they have better ways to build nuclear weapons than using U233.OK, sports fans. Quiz in the morning. Be prepared to discuss beta+ and beta- decay, and its relationship to production and decay of U-232. Also explain why the shell orbitals lead to a relatively stable Th-232 with a half-life of 14.5 billion years, slightly longer than the age of the universe. Finally, explain in detail why it is easy to separate the Uranium salts from the Thorium salts to recover the Uranium daughter products, what the daughter isotopes are, and why this reactor (a LFTR) is a breeder reactor, distinguishing the reaction of the U-233 from a mere catalyst.Simple!
