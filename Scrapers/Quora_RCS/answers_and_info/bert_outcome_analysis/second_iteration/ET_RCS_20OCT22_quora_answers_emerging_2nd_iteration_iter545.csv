It was designed by Shoji Kawamori, a qualified aerospace engineer and a modern doyenne of mecha anime. Is the VF-1 a jet fighter ? But of course !In form it is a smaller, single seat F-14 Tomcat, featuring thrust vectoring instead of rear flight surfaces - very avant-garde in 1982 !Delightfully, it too is a carrier-launched fighter, and the ‘hero’ fighter as flown by two of the main characters also features the famous skull-and-crossbones imagery of the US Navy fighter squadrons that have used this - VF-17, VF-61, VF-84 (who flew the F-14 at the time) and lately VFA-103 - The Jolly Rogers. In Macross they are known as ‘Skull Squadron’, a very suitable alternative label.Its also a fighting robot suit (and thus a Variable Fighter) and the reasons for this become apparent during the series - it is a military one….of course, this is not required for a space-borne jet fighter, but for a theoretical exercise, its a really well fleshed out one….Despite having gas turbine engines, they operate in space rather well. As Major Roy Fokker states to Hikaru Ichijo ‘With thermonuclear engines we can fly anywhere !’There is one fundamental permitting the Valkyrie in space, as an example of the concept : It literally has a thermonuclear fusion drive of very high specific output. In terms of propellant, such an engine can use anything as reaction mass - sea water, beer, Chanel No. 5, jet fuel, hydrogen - basically whatever is at hand. In Macross, the ship apparently snares some chunks of the rings of Saturn to use as its own reaction mass….This is the obstacle to making such a thing possible - we have literally no clue whatsoever on how to miniaturise this type of technology sufficiently to permit this kind of flight envelope.The Valkyrie itself is a fairly lyrical fantasy of fighter, in terms of its capacities - many of which we would need to solve - and cannot, as yet !* Made of a material called ‘hyper carbon’ provided by what turns out to be space alien technology gleaned from the ASS-1 (aka the Macross itself), its aircraft-thin skins apparently have the strength of main battle tank front armour !This is vital to the overall performance envelope of the craft, for combat - and transformation !They are also tapped for the computer controlled vernier thrusters in space which give the VF-1 the ability to be super manuverable in space combat - the beast can literally fly in the manner of an atmospheric fighter in space by these means.Where Star Wars fighters appear to do so ‘by magic’ which is not really acceptable to an enthusiast, the VF-1 at least has a solid reasoning behind its performance envelope.However, thanks to the American Space Shuttle program, a lot of the problems of ‘an aircraft in space’ have actually been solved !1. Aircraft tyres suitable for use in space have been developed and proved - this would be a significant consideration if it had not been solved.","99,875 followers",Alcatraz Dey,714,1.4K,68M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-work-would-it-take-to-modify-a-jet-fighter-to-be-able-to-function-in-outer-space

I wouldn’t go as far as saying this! I just can say I’ve written this question directly to Dassault and they never answered, in fact, they probably can’t answer themselves : at the present day, this material still hasn’t reached industrial production : it’s only made in small laboratories at astronomical costs, thus, mass production in factories has been added to the list of EU industrial priorities, then you have the politics and economical factors : if you end spending €1–2B per aircraft and you need 500 units to replace French, German and Spanish fighters, forget it, won’t happen!Other point making me think it to be feasible? France invented the Ramjet and the Mirage-III’s competitor, the Nord 1500 Griffon-II :already had a turbojet/ramjet combo engine in… 1957 !!!! You can see here how the turbojet was fit in the middle of the ramjet :Nord-Aviation was later merged with Sud-Aviation to create l’Aérospatiale, later renamed to its main product’s name, the Airbus.French are also accustomed at another type of dual propulsion : adding a rocket engine : using it, Mirage-III could reach 23,000m altitude or getting a serious boost when into a dogfight, this has surely helped more than once Israeli pilots facing MiG-21 which was supposed superior, at least on paper:In the early 50’s, French S.N.C.A.S.O came with the SO-9000 Trident as a supersonic jet fighter proposal. It had 2 turbojets on wingtipsand…An interesting project in the late 00’s is (was) the Adebaran space launcher to be used from a Rafale, in simple or trimaran versions :What is in fact interesting is… You have a 4t space-rocket, the trimaran weighting 12t (Rafale can take off with 12t under the 3 main hard points on condition to have only half internal fuel and do the complement from a tanker once airborne).From there, we can easily consider that, as FCAS is to be obviously bigger than Rafale, it may carry e.g. 4 of the Aldebaran 2 stages launchers, start by going hypersonic using ramjets, then use the 4 rockets to propel itself into space, moreover, the 1st stages may keep a little fuel and carry a warhead and the 2nd stage may carry a warhead too, so what allows you to enter space can also be used as weapon for space-borne strikes.Now, at the present day, what I’m writing here is pure Sci-Fi. All I do is pointing that if it is decided to make the Dassault/Airbus FCAS a “fighter plane [to] go to space”, since the necessary technologies are available and the two companies are no rookies when it comes to space-vehicles, added to the characteristics Dassault CEO spoke about, it is absolutely feasible for FCAS to become the 1st space-fighter, unless USA, Russia or China come with a “black-project”, and, again, at the present day, it’s banned by the SNT, but USA seems on the brink of violating the SNT due to the spread of A2/AD systems. If USA does so, be sure that we’ll end with a new arms race and all big boys will want a new toy…",UNKNOWN,Shinano,2.2K,362,3.1M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-work-would-it-take-to-modify-a-jet-fighter-to-be-able-to-function-in-outer-space
6,"Defense planners have realized that top speed is not that important. Fighter jets only flare up their afterburners when they are trying to escape a situation. It is simply far too inefficient to travel with afterburners blazing. An aircraft using afterburners consumes approximately 8x the fuel when compared to subsonic flight.

Overwhelm the enemy by massive numbers, use that strength and quantitative advantage to acquire an unassailable foothold that overcomes enemy resistance. (The Nazis, for instance had a definite qualitative advantage in equipment over the Soviets yet lost nonetheless).After the 1970s, Russian fighters relative to their western counterparts were:So what’s going on? This all looks quite impressive, so how are they actually falling behind?The answer, is that the US fighters over the same period had:So , essentially in the theatre of actual war fighting, US fighters would win before the Russian systems even had a chance of pressing home their advantages.NOTE: Russians did have BVR and other assorted capabilities at the time, but their missiles and their AWACS weren’t as reliable and were more prone to fall prey to electronic counter measures relative to western variants. They also lacked targeting pods and precision guided munitions capable of achieving parity in terms of reliability compared to their western counterparts.An Su-27 Flanker:An F-16 Fighting Falcon :F-16 shooting down a moving drone with its Sidewinder missile:Edit: 1 k upvotes! Thanks everyone !P.S: Unfortunately too many posters don’t know the difference between a valid criticism and personal insults. It’s a tragedy, there were a lot of valid points people were raising that I am more than happy to discuss and to correct, if needed. But apparently they couldn’t do that without also magically being able to deduce what my ‘‘intents” were in writing this. And so they levelled false accusations as to why I wrote this post in the first place. So let me set the record straight.I have openly stated that I am a commercial pilot with an interest in military aviation. I could be wrong on a number of things. Maybe even partially wrong on everything. Unless America and Russia were to engage in an actual all out air war, there will always be differences of opinion on this question.Everybody here has a right to point out what they feel are my mistakes or errors and reference facts to support their view. What they don’t have a right to do, is to accuse the other person of deliberately lying and having bad intentions in order to deceive. Especially when you are in no position to ascertain my intentions, seeing as how you are unacquainted with me outside of a few random posts on the internet.Everybody is encouraged to do their own research on this topic, and to examine whatever data they can. Including data of actual engagements, whenever these warplanes have seen use, which they often have, via 3rd party country stand offs. Don’t just blindly take my word for it, or anybody else’s.There, I hope I’ve now made it clear to everybody that I have no intention to ‘‘deliberately deceive” anyone here. OK?

I say such moves is actually necessary since a decline is inevitable, it might soften the landing by about 7–10 years. Essentially, a superpower like the US cannot falls too hard for fears of collateral damage to the international community. We might be avoiding a planatary size recession in this case. Most of the damage should be localized to the US and those heavily dependant on it.On China’s side, they are on the rise. These tarrifs, bans, sanctions etc, are required for them to go through. It allows for a learning process and to ractify their weaknesses and dependancy issues. I’m quite sure China as a whole can withstand this and come out stronger than the US is currently in a few years. From here onwards, regardless of whether ZTE survives this, China will be looking into processes to close the loop on where they are lacking. And the chinese seldom repeats their mistakes.On another point, it’s not that the Chinese cannot retaliate to such bans effectively, they can. If the chinese really wants to retaliate in kind, they can just ban the sale of rare earth to the US or to the major chips manufacturer in the US. After all, they produce 90% of the world’s supply.Would the US have the ability to produce their own supply or find a cost effective subsititute if it comes to that? Sure they can, but just like how ZTE is affected, it will take quite awhile to have sufficient infrastructure and scale to do that. I estimate it to be about 5–7 years. Meanwhile global economic and technological advancements will come to a screeching halt.In the end we do want someone better at absorbing shocks and more responsible than the current superpower to replace their position if the current one is already inedvitably failing.

They’ve been calling for structural change, upgrade in manufacturing and domestically grown technological standards for many years. It had been a tough sell. Now, it’s an easy sell.China also got rid of most its bubble in stock market and real estate. Especially the real estate, the private real estate providers in China all have USD debt. Because of the depreciation of CNY, those providers have been taking a huge hit. They have to refrain from fuming the real estate bubble in China.With some CNY depreciation, China was able to mitigate the stress on its export sector while at the same time get rid of its CNY debt. When Yuan depreciate, China exchanged USD to CNY to pay off all the CNY debt. The deleveraging process is almost completed by now. When the Yuan appreciate for a few month (the war was on hold at the time), China was able to exchange some CNY to USD and pay off some USD debt.US’s new visa policy also makes sure more talents are moving back to China. It is much easier for China to attract talented scientists and engineers. The provincial governors in China had been pulling out all kinds of tricks, from providing free housing and child-care to granting seed money to tax exemption. They are serious about hunting talents, and it’s working especially now that US is being such a dick.The Belt & Road program also got a great boost. Other countries are not only joining, but also taking initiative in designing and proposing new projects. Even Italy, a G7 member, signed on to Belt & Road this year.The internationalization of RMB was a tough going, because dollar worked so well before. Now, with all the sanctions and the trade barrier set up by US, it’s much easier to push for a second international currency. Since those countries are eager to import to China, they are starting to take RMB.What has the trade war did for US, so far?More bubbles in stock market and real estate.More national debt.Worse trade barriers with Canada, Mexico, EU, Japan and China.Worse sales in agriculture and oil.More debates between whatever parties and a gazillion democrats running for president.Some wake up call for US companies that instead of just being in China, they should have some part of their production lines in many different countries (anywhere except the high-labor cost counties like US), to mitigate the tariff risk.

Blaming the Japanese, Mexicans, Chinese, and other foreigners for domestic woes ingratiates politicians to excitable elements of the electorate and helps them direct voter anger away from their own records. It has become a kind of quadrennial tradition ever since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debate took centre stage in the 1992 election.Trump: “Our trading partners are cheating us, bilateral trade deficits are hurting the U.S. economy, U.S. negotiators have done a bad job with trade deals, and higher tariffs would help the U.S. economy.” Politicians often get criticized for flip-flopping, as they change their policy positions over time in an attempt to please voters or interest groups. On tariffs, Donald Trump has not flipped or flopped at all. As president, he is implementing the exact same policies he has talked about for years. Unfortunately, they are bad policies, based on a misreading of history and a misunderstanding of economics.In the 1800s, governments used tariffs as a primary source of revenue. Administratively, it was easiest to collect taxes on products as they entered a country, so for most countries tariffs were a main source of government funding. However, over the years governments found other alternatives, and tariffs as revenue became less important. Tariffs were also used to protect domestic industries. Other groups were hurt by this: U.S. consumers, who paid higher prices; and U.S. exporters, who were hit with retaliatory tariffs imposed by our trading partners. The infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs just after the start of the Great Depression disaster led Congress to delegate some of its power over trade to the president, so as to avoid constantly caving in to special interests. Giving the president more power over trade was successful for a while. However, there was a flaw: It only worked if the president supported trade liberalization. Most presidents did, at least to some degree, but now we have a president who genuinely believes it is good policy to give special interests what they want. Steel and aluminium producers get protection from competition; and farmers get subsidies to make up for the harms they suffer in the tariff war. All the while, consumers and taxpayers pay the price.Now we have testimony from farmers who are suffering from the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Mexico, Canada, the EU, China and others; manufacturers facing higher steel prices due to the Trump administration’s steel tariffs; and lower- and middle-class consumers who will soon notice price rises in their basic necessities as the administration’s tariffs on Chinese products increase. Tariffs encourage the deflection of trade to inefficient producers and the smuggling of goods to evade those tariffs; such distortions reduce welfare. Furthermore, consumers lose more from tariffs than producers gain, so there is deadweight loss. The redistributions associated with tariffs tend to create vested interests, so harms tend to persist. Broad-based protectionism can also provoke retaliation, which adds further costs in other markets. While the imposition of a tariff can reduce the flow of imports, it is unlikely to change the trade balance unless it fundamentally alters the balance of saving and investment. Tariff increases lead to declines of output and productivity in the medium term as well as increases in unemployment and inequality.In his writings, Navarro makes five distinctThe impossible-competition argumentIn ‘Death by China’, Navarro and Autry wrote that “China has stolen millions of American manufacturing jobs” and that “if we had held onto those jobs, America’s unemployment would be well below 5%.” In writing this they confounded macroeconomic factors and trade issues. In May 2016, five years after their book was published, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7%, and it has continued declining ever since. This is really scapegoating China. And during the same period, real U.S. income (real GDP) increased by 26%. All this occurred despite the worst recession since the Great Depression! The value of the goods imported from China is also often exaggerated. According to research done at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the proportion of American consumer expenditures that go to China, including the value of the Chinese inputs incorporated into what’s produced in America, is 1.9%. This is because Chinese goods occupy a big share only in relatively small categories of consumer expenditures (such as clothing and shoes, or furniture and household equipment), and because two-thirds of what Americans consume is composed of domestic services—such things as health care, education, and housing.Navarro’s “externality” argument is remarkably shoddy. Outcompeting producers is not technically an “externality,” but the normal result of a free and flexible economy where “creative destruction” occurs. If the result of competition is considered an externality, everything in economic life is an externality and the concept becomes useless. In the Schumpeterian world of Chinese commerce, it is death by competition for literally hundreds of start-ups within the country.The fairness argument: “Unfair” trade is not free trade and is destroying the American economy.Perhaps what people resent is competition based on allegedly unfair advantages that create a “non-level playing field.” This fairness argument may be the foundation of all other protectionist arguments, in the general public and among politicians. It’s an important argument that needs to be addressed. Intellectual property theft can be dealt with, through the WTO and ordinary courts, even Chinese courts. “American IP owners have in recent years enjoyed increased success in enforcing their rights in Chinese courts,” Stanford law professor Paul Goldstein has observed. Even the USA didn’t give a hoot about patents in its early years and up until 1989 when it decided to adhere to the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. From mid-2005 to late July 2018, the yuan increased in value 18% against the dollar, even counting the 8% drop since April 2018 when American protectionism started battering the Chinese currency. A national state cannot undervalue its currency for very long because doing so requires an increasing money supply, which generates domestic inflation and exerts an opposite effect on the currency.As for the lack of labor and environmental regulations in China, why should that be an issue? There were no such regulations in America and other Western countries when they started growing during the Industrial Revolution. Are rich Western producers (including trade unions) now going to dictate such regulations in developing countries? This sort of fairness looks rather self-serving and unfair.In general, low wages in poor countries are not “unfair.” It is because of their low wages that they have a comparative advantage in some economic sectors. Advanced countries have a comparative advantage in sectors more intensive in capital—including the human capital of specialized workers. This is a conclusion of the theory of comparative advantage that Navarro ignores. If the Chinese government is more mercantilist than the U.S. government, for whom is this unfair? Certainly not American consumers, who obtain cheaper goods thanks to the hapless Chinese taxpayers who pay the subsidies. It is not unfair for American consumers to get bargains on goods from China or other developing countries. It is not unfair to let private firms, wherever they are, compete to satisfy consumers. What is clearly unfair is to use the power of government to protect a small number of American producers, like the 2,400 American workers (at most) occupied in manufacturing washing machines, plus the shareholders (not all American) of the few domestic washer manufacturers, to the detriment of 97 million American households.The trade deficit argument: The U.S. trade deficit is a serious problem that reduces gross domestic product and indicates unfair trade.The trade deficit is a false problem originating from a faulty economic analysis, a statistical confusion, and a sort of logical prank. The economic error is to assume that a trade deficit is bad in itself. The United States had a regular trade deficit—or, more precisely, a merchandise deficit—until the Civil War, and a surplus during the Great Depression and the two world wars. There is nothing intrinsically bad about a global trade deficit, which implies that net foreign investment is coming into the country. Also, there is nothing intrinsically good in a trade surplus, which implies that net capital is leaving the country. A trade deficit, however, may be bad when as is currently the case in the United States, it is due mainly to high federal budget deficits that attract foreign purchases of Treasury bonds, but this cannot be attributed to the fault of foreign investors. The logical prank comes from begging the question, what is the problem with a trade deficit? It reveals unfair trade practices, answer protectionists. But how does a protectionist determine that trade is unfair? By observing that it results in a trade deficit! What sort of baloney is that?The retaliation argument: Retaliatory protectionist measures are justified against protectionist countries; such retaliators are the real free-traders.The retaliation argument claims that protectionism and retaliation against a mercantilist country actually promote “real” free trade. Some people go so far as to say that the protectionists in the Trump administration are free-traders at heart. Such beliefs are contradicted by their own actions as I illustrated in my answerSo we are now actually watching the effects of tariffs on domestic consumers, absolutely self-detrimental. Any trade is beneficial to all trading partners; otherwise, one party would walk away from the exchange. Individuals and private bodies should be left free to make their own bargains. The goal should not be to stop China from growing but, on the contrary, to not interfere with its people as they become richer and freer, just as Americans simultaneously do. Tariffs are short-term gains for politicians in exchange for economic pain, possibly long-term, for nearly everyone else, a standard result of government interventionism.The national security argument: Protectionism is required for reasons of national security.The national security argument is really just a protectionist excuse. If steel and aluminium are security issues, so are food and clothing – soldiers don’t fight naked and go hungry. It is trivially true that any foreign country that becomes richer could represent a more serious military threat because its government can extract or requisition more resources for war purposes. But it is no less true that wealthier people are likely to be less willing to go to war because they have more to lose economically. Thus trade can help prevent war. Making pariahs of the Chinese will harm, not improve, national security.But isn’t Chinese industrial policy a great threat? No. It is an error to believe, contra economic theory and history, that the controlled enterprises in a country dominated by a communist government can constitute a grave danger for efficient capitalist enterprises. The threat to the U.S. economy posed by the Japanese turned out to be greatly exaggerated. If China isn’t backsliding and its producers make advances in freedom and economic efficiency, then that is good for all of mankind.“Protecting” U.S. manufacturing is probably as outdated from a national security viewpoint as it is from a narrower economic viewpoint. Remember that in America as in other advanced countries, two-thirds of consumer expenditures are devoted to services. Another reason why the proportion of employment in the manufacturing sector has beenNavarro and his like-minded coterie are motivated by military fears and nationalist emotions. His arguments are not based on economic analysis. The trade deficit is caused by federal profligacy, in which case the solution is to solve the root cause of the problem. To obtain better results, one ought to apply a two-pronged approach: file complaints against China at the WTO under the various provisions that apply here (China is under greater obligations than most countries, as per the terms of its accession), and negotiate new rules in a multilateral agreement with China. An important part of the negotiation is that the United States and its allies have to be willing to give something. A one-sided deal is difficult for any country to accept, and this is certainly the case for China, given its history with unequal trade treaties with Western countries. For example, in exchange for China lowering its tariffs, the United States and its allies could agree to abandon the special, more onerous, calculation method used for China and a few other countries when setting anti-dumping duties. And recognising China as a market economy as promised. United States should also be negotiating trade liberalization directly with these same trading partners. The preferential trading arrangements that result would put China at a disadvantage and put pressure on it to liberalize. Unilateral tariffs have led to Chinese tariffs in response, but tariff liberalization could put pressure on China to pursue its own liberalization so as not to be at a disadvantage. That would have been a better strategy.It is possible to push China in the continued direction of reform. Think about the progress it has made since 1978. But reform in China will not happen with a trade policy that slaps tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and turns allies into foes.Thanks for A2A.","4,651 followers",Muhammed Borhanuddin,1K,148,16.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-work-would-it-take-to-modify-a-jet-fighter-to-be-able-to-function-in-outer-space

29,Yes it will be.Only highly skilled people getting 30–40 LPA in 5–6 yrs of experience and their count is less.Still Lots of people are not switching or working on the less salary so it will always be choice of cheap labour.No other country can provide this much amount of cheap labour in the world so Indian IT industry will always be the first choice.,0 followers,Sandeep G,2.9K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-much-work-would-it-take-to-modify-a-jet-fighter-to-be-able-to-function-in-outer-space

Let me share the analysis with you. It's pretty interesting…I was in Singapore, which was a client location. I was there for training for ~20 days and returned yesterday. Below is the image we clicked with the team on my last day:I am in the middle in a blue shirt.So, the thing is, I am a replacement for one of the team members, who is leaving for another opportunity. The person was working in Singapore and fresher at the time of joining. We got to know each other a lot better and are good friends now. I am hired in India by a KPO to work for them. I have experience of six years. For the analysis, I am converting all my currency numbers to INR.So, definitely I am not expensive to them (even at Rs. 28,00,000).Second case:Now, my point is, that in this world of globalization, boundaries should not decide the compensation. Especially where the work is virtual. That is why the salary in India is growing faster because they are underpaid. I expect this to continue until the parity between them is matched. Of course, the expenses would increase accordingly. That is why inflation is high in countries like India, compared to the USA. So, until the packages are matched… the growth in salary should be higher (at least than that of the employees in the developed economies). One day it will be matched and I estimate that it can take ~30–40 years.Hope you got my point.P.S: I want to share my thoughts but don't want to come to the front. By hiding my identity, I can share everything… and that is why I hide my face with a smile.

Rather, it’s a clever placement of 2D figures on the screen, and following perspective lines, plus some limited 3D geometry (the road lines). This was applied to vehicles too, the typical availalble hardware had graphic cards supporting “sprites”, small rectangles where you could draw something and move it very quickly, thanks to the graphic card wired functionality. So, the driven car was animated by swapping 3/4 different sprites and the the effect of an incoming vehicle was rendered by showing sprites of the same vehicle drawn in different sizes and positions.At the time, it was absolutely impressive, especially considering that it was running on hardware that was thousand times less powerful than any nowadays smartphone. In fact, I still run it with my smartphone from time to time, and obviously it has no performance problem with it, as it is also able to do do much better with frameworks like Unity.Oh, and we had game rooms where these wonders could be played in a setup like this:Which is also common nowadays, but imagine you are 16 and you’ve never seen an almost-real Ferrari that you can drive before legal age…Another example I love of 3D that is actually 2D is this:It was named Fire Trap, you had to climb your fireman avatar by coordinating two joysticks.

And then, accidentally transmitted my hack to a rival high-school, where I hear it created much consternation among faculty for an entire week!1974, Southside HS. Elmira, NY, somehow our math teacher got hold of a PDP-8/e, and started a class to teach programming in DEC Basic. At first we had to enter the bootloader via the front panel switches, then run in the half-hour of 4K papertape through the teletype reader, into the computer’s six entire k-words of memory, doing this each time the system had been turned off. Finally someone figured out that USUALLY the Basic code could be re-started (from a secret start-addr,) rather than relying on the startup stuff at the end of the papertape (an important part of this story.)The PDP-8/e had core memory. Several boads, 2K words each, iirc. If you knew how to gracefully crash the basic code, it usually could be re-started, even after power had been removed. (Plus, if you took the full bin of paper tape punch-holes off the side of the teletype, you could empty it out the window, and make it snow! )Good times.I discovered that our copy of Basic had some unknown string-array commands. LINPUT A$, inputting an entire line of text. These weren’t supposed to exist! The commands were found in the back of a manual for a more expensive Basic version. Mostly they didn’t work, but “LINPUT” was there. So was string-compare.So, I wrote a tiny program to generate wise-ass responses to system commands, and which, when running, just printed READY(crlf), as the PDP normally did when halted. Heh, by fortunate chance, the LINPUT command didn’t print any question-mark while waiting for input like it was supposed to! So, nobody would realize that my program was running. A second lucky break.Now, if you sat down at the teletype console, and typed in an entire Basic program, all your typing would be wasted (my program couldn’t store strings,) and then if you typed “LIST,” my program would say “Don’t bother me I’m busy.” Type “RUN” and it said “I can’t, I ain’t got no legs.” Plus a few others, one for each valid command.Easily defeated by anybody, just type CTRL-C. And then swear a lot, depending on how many lines of code you’d just carefully typed into nowhere.My program was only effective/hilarious for about a week, until everyone got into the habit of always hitting CTRL-C, to make sure that no joker who’d been using the system had left that f****g thing waiting for you.Months later, by fortunate chance I happened to be using the computer on the day before summer vacation. I was told to perform the last halt-system procedure before summer vacation, when I suddenly had an idea. I said “Just a sec.” I input the short papertape for my program, ran it, THEN halted the PDP-8 and turned off the power …while a Basic program was still running. (I never tried this before. Didn’t know if it would work.)[Summer vacation happens]Months later, on the first day of school, the math teacher tracked me down, and said “What was that thing you did just before we turned off the PDP-8?”Uh oh.Actually he started laughing, and told the entire story.Ours was the “football school,” while our rivals on the other side of the river were the “smart school” with all the science courses. Somehow they’d wangled the PDP-8 away from us during the summer. One of their teachers was going to present a teacher-only programming course, so they could all learn Basic language. Our own math teacher was NOT invited. By fortunate chance, the guy taking our computer had been carefully instructed in how to restart the PDP-8, so no bootloader and no thirty minutes of tapereader would be needed. He did this successfully.The PDP-8 said READY.Then he typed in his first “hello” program, and hit RUN.It said …I CANT I AINT GOT NO LEGS.Our math teacher swears that it took the other school an entire week to figure it out, and their summer course had to be delayed. The person using the computer had learned everything from manuals alone, and (by sheer bad luck) had somehow skipped the paragraph about breaking out of a running program. He didn’t know CTRL-C. Nobody else could solve the problem either, because apparently everyone else assumed he of course knew CTRL-C, and had already tried that, first thing …which he hadn’t.So yes, if you have a PDP-8/e running DEC Basic, and a Basic prgram is currently running, then if you halt the system, remove power for weeks, then restart, not only is Basic still in memory, but any Basic programs are still in there, and still running!Oldschool hacking. OLD-oldschool hacking, the master of the syncronicites. This “hack” required about eight unlikely amazing bits of luck and coincidences to first line up exactly. And, my “virus” was “transmitted” to our rival HS, by them coming in and physically taking our corememory-based PDP-8 computer away from us, so it couldn’t be used by Southside HS during the summer. Hacks via social engineering, performed by accident.Alchemist synchronicities? A Toltec accomplishment? Me and Richard Feynman, we both have the Red Dwarf Luck Virus. (So why aren’t we millionaires?)Other cool tricks, now somewhat lame…WRITING IN ASSEMBLER. In 1979 I had Conway’s Life going fast, on Altair-era Polymorphics 88 graphics. Well not that fast, on 8080 at 1MHz cycle speed, where I think a glider-gun was updating about six times per second. Also a voice-recorder, a Morse typer, even a Morse code listener (microphone to text, our 8080 home computer could understand human speech in 1979, as long as the human sounded like DAH DI DAH DI. DAH DAH DI DAH)Speaking of which, years later in 1982 I had another wonderful idea, but talked myself out of it: today called “computer viruses.”Or more specifically, why shouldn’t I write the very first personal-computer virus, then keep it secret, …so I can sell it as computer-game security software, self-installing?Infectious “Sony rootkits” of 1982.I bought a used Apple from a guy at work. On the APPLE-][-plus, I realized that if you have a custom-modified master-disk, which when loaded, can sit waiting, and then modify any other master-disk placed in the drive, then soon all Apple disks now have your code. It spreads worldwide, kinda-sorta like a “disease,” but this disease …is for home computers! Perhaps give away free Apple games to various high schools, to “infect” entire distant cities!And if your silent, unsuspected code is always watching for illegal copies of a certain video game, it can take action. It could even beI was just at the stage of doing 8080 dis-assembler on the Apple-][ OS when, I realized I didn’t want to become the famous person who invented the “home computer influenza.” Every computer-owner would be spitting on my grave (after they’d killed me slowly, hunted down by a crowd of Apple users equipped with tiny needlenose pilers. And soldering irons! They’ll kill me with cold, dirty soldering irons. With dull tips.)Eventually that title went to a high-school kid in ?1986?, who did exactly the same thing with the OS on his Apple-II+. But he let the thing get loose and start spreading through his school, rather than keeping it quiet like I’d been planning to do, nor selling the whole “virus-spread rootkit” concept to all the major game-companies of 1983.The “IBM PC” soon appeared, everyone started writing viruses for it, and the rest is history.So, I got lucky and took subconscious warnings seriously, and really dodged a bullet there! More like, dodged thousands of bullets …and also the tips of those cold, unsharpened soldering irons.[1] Are there any other “hacker” stories involving the PDP-8? I’ve yet to encounter one. I did hear that the Rochester NY planetarium back in the 1970s was run by a PDP-8. I wonder if they got up to any shenannigans with it?

I must admit... it was really cool.When I emerged from my basement, I went off to college, and, well, the Internet kind of made this whole thing look a bit silly, but it wasn't there for me when I needed it... when I needed a friend.NOTE: The really fancy BBS's had multiple modems, with simultaneous users, who sometimes could chat with each other, but I couldn't afford that for mine.",697 followers,Devi Prasad Khatua,25.1K,74,1.6M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-Indian-IT-industry-will-remain-a-choice-for-cheap-labour-as-people-are-frequently-switching-and-reaching-30-40-LPA-with-5-7-years-of-experience

Blitz on the Vic 20The Vic was a shared Xmas gift for me and my older brothers there was only one paddle to play, two games and the other one was 2player only which needed 2 paddles, we had plenty fights over it… I was an avid reader too, I would read everything I got my hands on, one day waiting for my turn to play I read the manual, it had full programs I could type in myself 🤔 instantly I was hooked on it… I'd spend hours (causing more fight) typing these programs into the Vic but we had no tape deck or disk driThe first game I played started my love affair with computers and development….

Eventually I made a clone of the very game that got me hooked in the first place and since then my programming kinda begins and ends with web languages, I know stuff like c and python but I dont get the same joy creating things with it","114,981 followers",Daveed Phoenix,7.3K,9.9K,159.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-work-would-it-take-to-modify-a-jet-fighter-to-be-able-to-function-in-outer-space

A silly game where the main objective was to beat everyone in challenges and grab the crown as a final challenge. Customizing the character as players leveled up or spent some money for things here and there like the battle pass.It seems that Fall Guys gets little content here and there, such as new skins for example.
