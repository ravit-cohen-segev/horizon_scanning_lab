0,"I think the key reason is to allow the spaceship to do a full round trip per Synod, rather than one way legs per Synod.The radiation argument is weak. Enough shielding will have to be provided anyways. Radiation is mostly a matter of keeping the levels under a certain limit. Cumulative exposure over many months isn’t an issue. I know some will disagree but empirical evidence shows that’s not the issue.

We have been stuck in low Earth orbit since the demise of the Apollo program in the early 70s, and the early promise of space exploration and colonisation has failed to materialise.Musk aims to break this cycle and introduce a new era of rapid development and expansion that will not only push mankind outwards, but enthuse people and fill them with a noble goal that is outward looking, instead of stagnating and turning ever inwards.We have two alternatives, reach out and fulfil our potential, or turn inward and slowly die.",152 followers,Tom Alexander,11.5K,160,3.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Elon-Musk-proposing-a-plan-to-speed-up-spaceflight-to-Mars

6,"Is it safe that SpaceX puts 29 engines on its Super Heaver booster? Yep.In the Apollo era, NASA officials were aware that the Soviets were, as many early scifi authors had foreseen, attempting to build a large rocket with a whole lotta little engines:NASA didn’t need to do this because they had the mighty F1, which the Air Force had started down the development process five years before NASA existed.So NASA officials liked to say that far from increasing redundancy as you would naively assume, having more engines just increased the chance of failure.Come again?Well this wasn’t entirely wrong.Is it safe that SpaceX puts 29 engines on its Super Heaver booster?

Having more engines does indeed increase the chance that one engine will fail, and if the failure of one engine has the result of damaging critical hardware nearby, that would be bad.That was the case, in fact, with the Soviet N1 rocket which had the unfortunate distinctions of having caused one of the largest non-nuclear explosion on Earth up to that time. But the N1 suffered from a number of handicaps that must be considered.First, the engines for the N1 were radically innovative, but designed and built in a hurry and on a relative shoe-string by a design bureau whose previous experience was limited to airplane engines. The American F1 on the other hand was modestly cutting edge maturation of the basic engine design used by the V2 rocket during the war and by Goddard before it. It was much bigger and better, but was not nearly as radical a leap, and it was started more than five years earlier and well funded.Second, the technology to adequately monitor and control the coordinated firing of so many engines simply did not yet exist. The Saturn had no more than five engines on any given stage, a much more manageable control problem in which even limited manual intervention was possible.Third, Soviet industry and engineering talent had been decimated by World War II and Stalin’s purges before it, and the repercussions from all that were far from mere history at the time the N1 was designed and constructed. At the same time, American industry and engineering talent had benefited immensely from the war, and multiple ways we Americans are far too eager to interpret as inherent superiority.So yeah…between the Saturn V and the N1, more engines definitely increased the odds of big rocket go BOOM! Which the N1 did time and time again.But at the very same time NASA was extolling the virtues of larger, fewer engines, combustion instability in the giant F1 was never fully understood or solved, and every Apollo launch prior to Apollo 14 experienced POGO oscillations potentially dangerous to the mission, and addressed by simply shutting the first and second center engines down early (and then earlier). Subsequent analysis suggests that at least as late as Apollo 13, the first stage center engine may have failed, and its only good fortune that prevented catastrophe.Also at the very same time, the FAA was requiring four engines on long distance trans-oceanic airliners, specifically for redundancy.A 707 or 747 can fly on two engines. Not well, but well enough to reach an airport. Of course, having four engines increases the odds that one of them will fail, and airliners have crashed in the past because of damage caused by the disintegration of or fire caused by a failed engine.That’s why since the late 1950s, most airplane have hung their engines in pods below the wings. This is inefficient, but it eases maintenance and increases isolation in the event of a failure. Over the years, manufacturers have also found ever more effective ways to shield engines with lightweight armor and enable them to fail gracefully instead of catastrophically in the even of damage in object ingestion.So now, half a century later, Space-X is building a Saturn class launch vehicle around a platform loaded with comparatively small, comparatively radical rocket engines, and you are more than justified to wonder, “is that safe?”Well, lets consider a few differences between then and now.Put all this together and yes, not only do I think its safe to put engines on a Super Heavy booster, I think it provides redundancy and a number of efficiency and other advantages.","35,110 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.1K,12.3K,142.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Elon-Musk-proposing-a-plan-to-speed-up-spaceflight-to-Mars

We know that 30 engines is too much (N1 rocket), so that’s why SpaceX stopped at 29.Note: while this is tongue in cheek, I really would not be surprised if this were the ACTUAL reason for having 29 engines on SuperHeavy.

On a space rocket, failure of even one engine out of 30Each engine is an immensely complex thing, with lots of plumbing, valves, and turbopumps. Each of these devices works under incredible thermal and mechanical stress. And failure could manifest not just as “the engine gracefully shut down”.

You know, all these nasty things that eventually lead to explosion on a launch pad.To this day, no successful design involved such a number of engines.USSR didn’t have an engine that could be close to the American F1 in terms of thrust and efficiency, so N1 had total of 30 smallerNow the bad news: out of 4 N1 launches,Now, if you analyze these failures, there are two main root causes for that:Of course, one could counter these by the following arguments:In any case, I genuinely hope that Starship first stage with all its 30 engines would work flawlessly.

I doubt this guy had any martial arts experience at all, he just knew that he was a man and that she was a female with long hair. I have seen this so many times in my almost 50 yrs. of life.But in all honesty, any martial that teaches you all of these ridiculous combinations to do and you don’t practice them hard sparring are useless. You’ll learn 1000’s of techniques in a style like Krav Maga but you don’t practice those because you are wearing gloves when you do spar or might not even spar at all. So, the hole poke to the eye technique with a chop to the throat and kick to the sisters is all fantasy and doesn’t work the same on one person as well as it might another. Steven Seagal learned this when he told Gene Lebell he could escape Genes rear naked choke and Steven pooped his pants. True story.When you see a Krap Maga martial artist get their ass kicked by a practical martial artist in JJJ/BJJJ or a boxer/Mui Thai fighter that is why. Techniques are simple to practice and easily mastered after a short amount of time.Believe it or not, martial arts can get you beat up even worse. A lot of places instill over confidence in people because they got their black belt in Krap Maga, and they go out and get whooped real bad by someone that just wrestled a few years or learned a few boxing techniques. Realistic technique works a lot better than advanced technique because you only have to practice them a few hundred times before they are practical.

Everyone has to agree with me, or they’re stupid.”However, I do understand why people say that traditional martial arts aren’t effective.Now, this is what I HEAR from other people who fight or modern martial artists, so please don’t try attacking me.In some traditional martial arts, they make people bow in a fight to show respect to each other.There’s nothing wrong with that, but it works in a dojo. In a real fight, there’s no such thing as “honor.” The opponent will do ANYTHING to win. The opponent isn’t going to bow and get into their stance, ready to fight. No, the opponent is going to actually fight dirty to win.If a traditional martial artist is going to bow in a street fight, the opponent isn’t going to bow. The opponent is going to see that as a sign of weakness, and strike first.I think the second reason why people don’t look fondly on traditional martial arts is2) Traditional martial artists can’t take hits.Now, in my opinion padding does help for beginners who are trying to learn how to fight. A good teacher wouldn’t just force people to attack the beginners without protection so the beginner can “man up” and be a badass.However, the problem is that most traditional martial artists don’t have padding, and can’t take hits. Most traditional martial artists are so used to the padding, that when they go in a real fight, the second they get hit by a rookie, they’re down for the count.You guys may think “oh, I can shake off a hit from someone. It’s a hit, I can handle it.”As someone who got in a fight one time in high school and only won by luck, I can gurantee you. Getting hit HURTS like hell. If the person is going to hit you in the arm, I can gurantee you that most of the public aren’t going to “shake off the pain.” No, most of us are going to only think about the throbbing pain, and will probably call off the fight.There’s a reason why the only sparring fights in martial arts I consider at least a bit better and closer to reality are these ones.Even though they’re wearing gloves, at least they’re not wearing armor like padding. It’s more accurate, and they can at least build more pain tolerance.People say that most traditional martial arts don’t allow “full contact” sparring, or heck most traditional martial arts don’t allow people to spar to know how its like in a fight.Most traditional martial artists don’t like to spar with other people because they can “hurt” their opponent. But modern fighters argue “Isn’t that the point of self-defense or at least martial arts? To teach people how to defend themselves and defeat the opponent so they won’t attack again.”That’s what I hear from most modern martial artists talk about traditional martial arts. Don’t know if its true, but it’s what I hear.The third reason why people don’t like Traditional Martial Arts3. They don’t really teach effective martial arts, or are mcdojosA McDojo is a school that only cares about money, and doesn’t teach people how to fight. Most traditional martial arts fall victim to mcdojos (although mma schools may have some mcdojos).But people keep on saying that traditional martial arts don’t really teach effective self defenseDoes anyone see the problem? The guy one the right could easily hook the guy on the left when the guy on the left is doing his “self-defense”.That’s the thing, most opponents wouldn’t just punch and let their fist hang in the air so the other person can do self defense. The opponent will not just do one move, and that’s it.(Don’t know if my answer will be collapsed for this) but look at this gifYou see that person with the boxing gloves? He’s not doing one move, and that's it. He’s doing multiple moves, and being unpredictable. Now, it might not be accurate to real fighing, but at least its better than the opponent doing one punch, and letting their fist hang in the air.That’s the problem most people have with traditional martial arts. In modern times, street fighters are going to do a combo move. They’re not going to keep on spamming the same move, or just do one move, and be done.Now, I may not be a great godly fighter like Chuck Norrisor a skilled martial artist like Bruce Lee or Donnie YenBut I can easily tell you that being in a fight is actually very scary. Movies make being in fights seem pretty badass, but trust me if you were in your first fight you might be scared out of your mind, and be unfocused.Now, I don’t really look down on any martial arts. If you think Tai-Chi is effective in martial arts, or Caiopera is effective in martial arts. Go ahead, it’s your opinion.

I’d suggest that smoking at least 1 gram of ice and 2 grams of cannabis per day for at least 12 months would get you well on the way.I’d also suggest taking take LSD at least twice per week and other drugs such as ketamine, MDMA, cocaine, and synthetic cannabis whenever you can get your hands on them.Drinking copious amounts of alcohol on a daily basis would probably also help.It’s really important that you stop eating foods that contain essential nutrients for brain health - fruits, vegetables,I think the first step would be to begin taking large quantities of illicit drugs on a daily basis.

Just stick to McDonalds and KFC.Just to be sure, I would do my best to avoid sleeping as much as possible. Each time you feel tired, smoke enough ice to stave off the lethargy and keep yourself up for another hour or two. You will obviously get to a point where you can longer stay awake from time to time, just do your best to keep sleep to a minimum.After around twelve months, a combination of drugs, alcohol, lack of nutrition, and lack of sleep, should have you pretty ready, so it’s time to start googling terms such as “flat earth proofs”, “fake moon landings”, “the holocaust hoax”, “Eric Dubay”, “9-11 hoax”, etc.I believe by this stage your mental state should be quite open to accepting a flat earth and other drivel you will find on the net.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,838,45.5K,294.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Elon-Musk-proposing-a-plan-to-speed-up-spaceflight-to-Mars
