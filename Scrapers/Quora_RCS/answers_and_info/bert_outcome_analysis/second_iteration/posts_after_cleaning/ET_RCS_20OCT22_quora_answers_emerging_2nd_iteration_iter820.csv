A. M!!Some people really don't have a life.She then looked through the camera and saw a robot in front of her house. The robot seemed to had a package.She pressed the open bottom for him to come in.He came and left the package on the floor.Arsinoe: And what is this supposed to mean?, is it for me?Robot: A birthday gift for Ms. Spencer from Mr. Spencer.Her brother was giving her a birthday gift! How kind of him.Arsinoe: Thanks for the delivery.And with that the robot left.Arsinoe was actually very excited now.“Well, maybe this 25th birthday won't be as shitty as I thought! “And with that she opened anxiously the package. The package transformed from its small size in the beginning to something huge and when it opened, Arsinoe was now dying from excitement, she“what the actual f- “How could her brother Sky do something like this??“That jerk knows perfectly well how much I hate robots! ”She was about to call and tell him that she was planning on throwing that piece of trash right were it belonged to, when the robot suddenly started speaking.“Hello Madame, what's your name?”*He sounded veryArsinoe: My name is Arsinoe and sorry but you are going straight up to the trash.Robot: But why Madame, you just met me.Arsinoe: Stop calling me Madame! My name is A-R-S-I-N-O-E, get it? And you are here because of an accident.Robot: What kind of accident?Arsinoe: Today is my birthday, and my brother gifted you to me….Robot: But that's wonderful! Because-Arsinoe: Only that I absolutelyRobot: Madame, please I don't know what problem you have with robots, but I can assure you that I am different and-Arsinoe: That doesn't change the fact that you are still a robot, get out!Robot: I promise to do whatever you tell me-Arsinoe: OUT!Robot: I'll be a friend to you-Arsinoe: I SAID OUT!Robot: I can help you at work-Arsinoe: OUT!!!! - Wait, what, really?Robot: Yes, I already have a chip installed in me, and I also know where you work, your time schedule, your colleagues, the personal information of your boss-”NO WAY!!”: she thought.Arsinoe: OK. Forget all that I said before. You can live hear and you need a name….. OK…. So from robot…. - Robert. Yea Robert, how's that?Robert: I think that's awesome.The next days and weeks Arsinoe got learn that her brother Sky, specifically built Robert for her. He knew perfectly well, through what his little sister was going through and that was his way to try to help her.And Robert wasHe transformed her absolutely messy bedroom into this.Robert did everything. The cleaning, cooking, washed all the dishes, cleaned her office, dried and prepared her clothes, bought groceries etc.“ He is actually really helpful”Since the house became much more cleaner than before, Arsinoe had more time and space to concentrate, she started to eat healthy and was being successful at work!Arsinoe went to the library one day, just to read. Something that before she would haveShe opened a book wich showed how people used to live like 170 years ago in 2020.“Hmph, those primitivesThen on one page of the book, there was a task for a contest.Is you could tell the people (for example a friend) of 2020 what life is like in 2190, what would you write? A short Essay is appreciated.The best and most accurate text will win a very special prize.“She went home and asked Robert what he thought about it.Robert: I think it's a great idea, Madame Arsinoe, you are very creative when you want to.Arsinoe: I don't know if I should take that as a compliment, but hey I'll give it a try. I've got nothing to loose right?Robert: Absolutely. And I will help you as much as I can.So with that Arsinoe started to write. She would write every single day, at every single free hour she had. If Robert didn't warned her that she had to eat, bath and sleep as well, she wouldn't have done any of those.One day, some 3 months after Arsinoe had giving her text to the jury inspectors a letter came to her house.Dear Ms. Arsinoe Spencer,We are very glad to tell you that you have won the contest with the best and most interesting story on “ Tell your friend from 100 years ago how you live”.Please come to pick up your prize as soon as you can, and if you want to and don't mind, you could read it out for all the other participants in the contest.But you are absolutely not forced to.Thank you very much for your wonderful story.With best regards,Your Jury team.Unbelievable.She had just won!!She couldn't believe it!“OfBut before that, like every evening she had chess match against Robert, and like every eveningRobert: Madame Arsinoe, the result is already 107-0, maybe you should give up…Arsinoe: NEVER!!They continued for 30 more minutes until Arsinoe couldn't bear the embarrassment any more and went to bed.Arsinoe: RobertRobert: Yes Madame Arsinoe?Arsinoe: I hate you.Robert:The next day she rushed to the contest site, and proudly took her prize. (a 6 day trip to Mars for the next month).She stood in front of everyone and started to read:Hello dear friend or whoever you are from 170 years ago.You are surely very interested in knowing what the future will look like right?I would be too, and honestly the conditions you are living in your time are very unpleasant to say the least.But let me tell you that the future looks much brighter!These are just some of the things that will exist.Super skyscrapers:Earth-scrapers:Underwater cities:Personal flying drones replacing cars:3D printing of houses and furniture:Flexible, smart walls and 3D printed Michelin starred meals:Virtual meetings:Home medi-pods:Colonisation of space:The Internet has revolutionised the way we communicate, learn and control our lives.There are towering megastructures, as well as sub-aquatic cities and transportation via advanced flying drones – some of which could be strong enough to transport entire houses on holiday.""Just as the technology driving the Internet has spread to smartphones and smart homes, the smart home revolution is destined to spread to larger communities and countries. By simply turning lights and heating off when we don't use them, we can reduce emissions. By being able to better monitor and secure our homes, we can reduce crime. By better monitoring the habits of aging relatives, we help them to achieve greater quality of life.Unfortunately, you are most certainly dead by this time so you won't experience any of these.But don't worry, we have our lives in control!!Good luck with yours!Best wishes,Your distant friend Arsinoe.When Arsinoe finished the crowd applauded at her heavily.She felt very proud of herself. Like never before in her life. Her entire family and friends were probably looking at her!She looked into the direction of Robert and smiled at him.He winked back.When everything was over, Arsinoe went to the roof of the event to gather some time for herself, to think.Robert had really changed my life, I wouldn't be here today without him, but also I have to thank Sky. He noticed at least that something was wrong with me.Arsinoe thought about her life. What did she wanted to do? What was her goal in life? What was her future? She definitely didn't wanted to live for ever alone. She had Robert, but… She needed a family.Maybe Robert can help me?She said with a little grin in her face.She looked across the city from above.And then decide to head back.Full of hope for the future.","6,448 followers",Michael Soareverix,600,373,6.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-future-on-Earth-will-look-like-in-100-or-200-years

Most countries have modernized and ""3rd world"" countries (in the sense of poor countries) have modernized. Network access is free for all, and considered a base right of all people.Smaller countries have combined into unions to promote more trade. These unions are more like the EU than the US model. The EU itself has become fully federalized, with the capital in Brussels.The UK is still independent from the EU, but has closer ties to the US. It's become a republic after abolishing royalty and peerage.The US has peacefully consumed Canada, after Quebec Independence (our third try at annexing Canada. This time it's their idea). There is a motion to annex Mexico, but that will happen later (not in the next 100 years).Populations of China,India and other Asian countries have stabilized to a slow growth rate. Africa is still a mess. Too many people, and too much fighting. The population of the world is at 15 billion, and growth has slowed, though not stopped.The middle east - Numerous attempts at founding an islamic caliphate have failed, but still there has been a consolidation of countries, and the movement is still alive.Computing:Massive parallel processors on a scale that can't be believed. Everything is networked, even throw-away items. Even people - our bodies are biological networked computers, and we use the new technologies to attach ourselves to the network. This leads to breakthroughs in communication, VR, medicine, etc. Wireless human networking becomes eerily like magic (telepathy, healing, etc).Transportation:Automobiles are being replaced (slowly) by mass transit. But fleets of electric drone pods are getting more popular as well. Just call one, and it will arrive, step in and tell it where you are going, and it will fly you there and land you safely and quickly.Power:Tidal stations are supplying most of the power for seaboard cities. On the interior of the continents, there are still some nuclear plants. But most have been replaced by new types of power plants that simply harness the heat from the planet itself -- drill down deep enough (like 50,000 feet) and it gets really, really hot. However, a lot of power from steam can be generated quickly.Space:We'll have colonies on Mars and the Moon. However, not a lot of people live there, and not a lot of people even want to go. They'll grow slowly over the next 500 years, until a native born population has increased to critical mass. The Martian colony will be more successful, because of the water and air that already exists. However, people will live in fully enclosed cities, and have to extract heat from the planet itself.  Space travel will still be costly, but with privatization, the cost has come down drastically. Intersystem travel is faster, and years of travel has become months. This is still very expensive, so sending someone or something to Mars is not common. Communication satellites are placed in orbit around the sun so that colonies on Mars and the Jovian moons are able to keep in touch with each other and with Earth.Language:People will keep their national languages alive, but minor regional languages will die out. Most business and scientific communication will be done using English and Chinese.Global Warming/Climate Change:Global warming will slow, but will still be a problem. The sea levels will slowly rise, but not enough (and not fast enough) to cause any issues that can't be addressed. Places that used to get snow once or twice a year will no longer get it. However, it's undeniable at this point in time, so there are active measures to combat it.Crime:Though the rate has dropped quite a bit, violent crime is still a problem in many areas, unfortunately. There are still the haves and the have nots. Though the poor have adequate living quarters and food, our consumerism that has fostered a culture of entitlement is still going strong, and this breeds dissatisfaction. The amount of network connected surveillance (both public and private) has however, made it harder to get away with it.Media:The printed book, newspapers and magazines have completely disappeared, as has broadcast and cable TV.  These have all been replaced with on-demand content from the network. The middle-men that have been driving up the price everywhere have long since disappeared. First, it was the local providers (like your local cable company). Then the networks (like HBO, etc).  Now, producers make the content, and sell it/stream directly through a small group of massive providers that sell access to the content on consignment.Entertainment:Massive access to the web, and technology advances hav led to some new types of entertainment. The biggest would be interactive movies. These are similar to existing movies, except that they can be experienced in fully immersive 3D. Anyone can view as a disembodied viewer, or they can take the POV of any of the scripted parts. AI's run the characters. People who have a certain following (or ""karma"") can jump in and control the actors at any time. The AI will control the characters that aren't guided by actors, and will guide the plot toward successful conclusions. Actors will gain following (and money) through the voting of viewers.Education:Education itself will be ran by teachers in conjunction with AI. This will allow students to learn at their own pace. The smart kids will no longer become bored under-achievers, and those that are disadvantaged can be taught at the rate that is most helpful for them. Standardized testing (the bane of the current system) will become more fair, and people will graduate based on knowledge, not on how long they've been in the system. Instead of being told to memorize passages in a book, the students will hold conversations in VR with an active AI that can answer questions and guide them, and ensure that they know the subject before moving on.Robotics:Robotics has advanced enough that multipurpose household robots are possible, though the vast majority of people do not care or want one. Still, some smaller robots are made that most people have - small machines that sweep, mop their floors, clean up after the dog, and pick up dirty clothes and things from the floor.Employment:Most work still requires a human. However, many more automated systems have been introduced, and a single person can do the work of many. This has led to a movement that it is OK to be unemployed, especially in a household that also already has an income. More people are moving to a contractor style arrangement, where they work when required or needed, pulling small jobs from job boards, etc. Others are moving more toward part time self employment on the web - creating entertainment, articles, impromptu acting (etc).Relationships:Despite dire predictions, the legalization of gay marriage didn't cause a collapse of society. In fact, it hardly made any difference at all. In general, less people overall are getting married, and more people are just choosing to live together without contracts. Marriage in general is still widely practiced, but just not what is expected. The next marriage war was over polygamy/polyandry, and while it never actually was legalized, it was decriminalized. This made very little impact, as it was not widely practiced besides a vocal few. At this point, people just basically quit caring.Communication:Networked people and constant access by anyone to the network has made cell phones a thing of the past. Now, you can communicate with basically anyone you want at any time. This became an incredible annoyance to people, and the rise of AI assistants to handle communication requests and take messages has become the norm.Well, that's quite a bit for now. This is just off the top of my head.",991 followers,Imran Roy,5.2K,841,3.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-future-on-Earth-will-look-like-in-100-or-200-years

Although we are yet to see flying cabs around our cities, some people today do get about on commercial commuter planes:3.Electric scrubbing of floors by some sort of automated robotic machine was another prediction of life by the year 2000.

The advances and changes are too numerous, too profound, too bizarre.

AGI is Aritificial Intelligence that is on par with Human Intelligence and that can advance itself, essentially make itself smarter. It is estimated that within a day of reaching AGI, the AGI will advance itself or create a version of itself that is ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence).
