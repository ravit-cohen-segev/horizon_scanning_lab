1,"As the name itself says internet of thing's - most of the ""things"" are products powered by embedded systems for example a coffee machine, a washing machine, a embedded board connected reading various sensors etc. Now when these products are connected to each other or are connected to a central location (cloud ) through internet, the resulting solution process or solution is termed as IoT.  So the crux is, embedded system is one of the most important part of the IoT. All it need is to include a internet enabling device like(1) GPRS(2) Wifi(3) Ethernetand a cloud and you are done.

Let me give you a example. Arduino is a prime example of one of the most popular DIY board. Right? Now, plug a potentiometer or any other sensor and this can be termed as a small embedded system. Now add a GPRS shield on top of Arduino and send data to any open source cloud like the Thingsspeak , data.sparkfun and you are done doing a small IoT project.",0 followers,Tom Crosley,659,2.6K,22.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-merge-IoT-and-embedded-systems
2,"Q: What brought the theory of the Internet of Things?No such thing as the “theory of the Internet of Things”, but the idea is to place a connected computer into existing devices (or be their own device). The idea itself started probably 40+ years ago, and prior to the public internet. Mainly in manufacturing for process management and quality control using sensors and manually wired connections.Computers and network connectivity is ubiquitous in industrialized countries so the idea is to be sure these devices (all very tiny now) can be imbedded and communicate with each other.So these “things”Q: What brought the theory of the Internet of Things?No such thing as the “theory of the Internet of Things”, but the idea is to place a connected computer into existing devices (or be their own device).

Because the internet was the hottest new trend in 1999 and because it somehow made sense, he called his presentation “Internet of Things”.",UNKNOWN,Amarnath,13.1K,131,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-merge-IoT-and-embedded-systems
4,"1. At the BeginningThe Internet of Things ( IoT) does not exist for a long time. Since the early 1800s, there have also been dreams of machines that interact. Since the first phone was built in the 1830s and 1840s, computers have provided direct communication. The first radio transmission of the voice took place on June 3, 1900, described as ""wireless telegraphy,"" providing a further component required in order to build the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things growth. Computers were developed in the 1950s.The Internet was founded by DARPA (Defense Advanced Projects Agency) in 1962 and be1.

The Internet of Things growth. Computers were developed in the 1950s.The Internet was founded by DARPA (Defense Advanced Projects Agency) in 1962 and became an ARPANET in 1969. The Internet itself is an essential component of the IoT. Business service providers started to encourage the use and transformation of ARPANET into our modern website in the 1980's. The Department of Defense has made a stable , highly functional system of 24 satellites a fact in early 1993. This was soon followed by private satellites, which were put in space. Satellites and landlines provide a significant part of the IoT with simple communications.IPV6 made a remarkable intelligent decision to increase the number of addresses an additional and significant factor in the creation of a functional IoT. ""We can allocate an IPV6 address to every atom on the earth's surface and still have ample addresses left for another 100 + earths,"" says Steve Leibson of the Computer History Museum. ""Additionally we will not run off internet addresses at any time.2. Concept RealizationOnly in 1999 was the Internet of Things formally called as a term. The Carnegie Melon University was the first Coca Cola machine on the Internet of Things from the early 80s. Local programmers would connect the cooled appliance to the Internet and check whether drinks were available and if it was cold before the journey.The Internet of Things had grown in 2013 into a multi-technology system, from the Internet to wireless and micro elector-mechanical systems to embedded systems. The IoT is enabled by conventional automation (including home and building automation), wireless sensor networks, GPS systems , control systems etc.The Internet of Things consists of any computer connected to the internet with an on / off switch. This covers virtually everything you can think of, from cellular phones to building repairs to an aircraft jet engine. The data transfer can be transmitted across a network and members of the IoT through Medical devices such as a heart monitor or a biochip transponder for a livestock animal. If you have an off / on switch, it may be part of the device technically. The IoT has a vast network of ""things"" and devices linked to the internet. An excellent example of a modern Internet of Things addition can be found in Ring, a doorbell connected to your smartphone.3. New Methods to Connect DevicesConsider the phrase, ""any system that can be linked together with other devices,"" while thinking about IoT. IoT is ready for fresh and innovative concepts that can add to current tasks. Imagine an alarm at 6 a.m. to warn the coffee maker simultaneously to turn on and start brewing coffee. Imagine your printer understanding when you run low on paper and order more automatically. Imagine your wrist watch saying ""where"" you were the most effective at work. The IoT can be used to coordinate transport networks, for example. ""smart cities"" will use it for waste reduction and optimising energy usage.Actually, the IoT offers an interconnection of our devices and equipment that is almost infinite. This creative area is wide open and provides a broad variety of ways to ""link devices."" Partly because the effect of these interconnections is not well known, it may be an exciting time for imaginative individuals. IoT presents future security issues as well as opportunities. The Internet of Things is actually better looked at with an open spirit, for imagination and a protective mentality for privacy and protection.4. User PrivacyAs sensors and video cameras become more popular, especially in public spaces, consumers are becoming less aware of and have no way to avoid information collected.Many people are uneasy about the possibility of corporations gathering information on this topic and even more uneasy about selling it to everyone. Older people typically disagree with more information than young people about themselves collected, but according to one inquiry about 45% of ""all"" respondents have refused to trust organizations to use the information they collected to protect their privacy.Actually, privacy options are rather black and white. The customer is required to give up all anonymity, or the customer actually can access the service (often in an arrangement, so that people do not bother ploughing through it). This has contributed to ongoing debates on digital privacy and how best to inform consumers about privacy and data access.5. SecurityWhile measures need to be taken to ensure protection, this problem should not be surprised if it is an important concern for the growth of the IoT. Millions of computers are actually interconnected, allowing (eventually) people to hack into your coffee making facility and then access your whole network. In addition , the Internet of Things makes organizations worldwide more vulnerable to security threats. Furthermore, the use of the Internet of Things makes data sharing and privacy a problem. Take into account how issues will evolve as millions of devices are connected.This statistic shows the Internet of Things (IoT) security spending worldwide from 2016 to 2021, by segment. In 2017, the endpoint security spending amounted to 302 million U.S. dollars.
