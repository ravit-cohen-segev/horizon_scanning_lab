I feel like existing attempts to achieve consciousness in computers are still very much in the feather-gluing stage; we don't yet know ourselves well enough to duplicate whatever it is that makes us both think and think that we think.

6,"There are several extremely important real life aspects of structural engineering (steel design in particular) that are sadly not taught in school at all.It’s an old adage that says, “You can always tell a young engineer’s design - every column and beam is a different size because some computer program told him that would be the most efficient.” Over-simplifying this point, say you design a building and your program determines that the most efficient design needs one of thoThere are several extremely important real life aspects of structural engineering (steel design in particular) that are sadly not taught in school at all.It’s an old adage that says, “You can always tell a young engineer’s design - every column and beam is a different size because some computer program told him that would be the most efficient.” Over-simplifying this point, say you design a building and your program determines that the most efficient design needs one of those beams to be W16x100 and 8′ long. To fabricate that beam, the fabricator has to purchase a 20′ stick of W16x100. He cuts your 8′ beam off and the other 12′ “drop” he dumps in his bone yard. However, the cost of the entire 20′ beam is paid for by the Owner. So, as you can see, the cost of your beam could easily be twice the cost of the actual weight of the steel that goes into your building. If your design needs 2 of those 8′ long beams, then he cuts both out of the 20′ stick and he is left with a 4′ drop but again the Owner pays for the entire 20′ stick the fabricator had to purchase in the first place. If you have other steel members in your design with higher load bearing capacity, it may be cheaper for you to use a heavier member in this case selected from a more common beam size used in your building than a one-off of an odd section used only a few times.Expanding on this, say your design yields 100 beams that are all 11′ long, the fabricator has to buy a 20′ stick for each of those to be cut from and there is a 9′ drop generated from each that goes in the bone yard. You pay for it all. (Note: You are paying for the fabricator’s labor as well as the steel he fabricates. It isn't cost effective for him to cut 2′ off one of the drops and full pen weld it to another 9′ drop to get one of the 11′ beams needed…and you, as the engineer, probably wouldn't accept it even if he tried.)Likewise, think about your column splice locations. If you set a column splice at elevation 21′ above the base plate, you might be paying for a 40′ stick of wideflange member for that one column (with a 19′ drop). I always tried to set splices to yield column section lengths of 19′ or so to minimize the drop lost in fabrication (assuming the loads did not dictate otherwise of course). It's worth a call to a local fabricator to ask what lengths they can get of a specific steel section. With some odd sections, there may only be 20′ and 40′ sticks available. Other sizes may have more or fewer standard lengths available.Your design program’s material take off might tell you the weight of steel actually installed in your building, but it's not telling you how much steel you are paying for in order to get what actually goes in the building.2.The most efficient design has a safe shelf life of about 1 month. After that, all bets are off. You have no idea what is going to go on in that building after it is built. They may have a slow water leak. Chemicals may get spilled. New equipment might get installed. Equipment might get moved. Corrosive fumes might be regularly vented nearby. Things might get welded on some beams and cut off others. There may be a great long term maintenance effort…or none whatsoever. It might be inspected and repainted yearly…or never looked at again for the life of the building. You have no idea. Even with the safety factor inherent in steel design, designing to the edge of efficiency is dangerous. Too many young engineers get caught up in searching for every exception they can find in the Code to let them lighten up a steel section (thinking that will make them look like really smart engineers), but that gives you little or no margin for error for “real life” to happen. I am NOT saying to grossly overdesign your structures, but I have never understood the value in designing things right up to the bloody edge of Code allowability. Steel is cheap compared to defending your PE stamp. 10+ years down the road, if there is a failure, the first suspect is the engineer’s design and you are somewhat considered guilty until you prove yourself innocent, which can be costly (one of the reasons why we have professional liability insurance).3.Repetition is your friend. Even with piece marks on the steel, a steel erection is a complicated jigsaw puzzle in 3D. Anything you can do to lessen the complication of this erection task lowers the number of labor manhours it takes to complete the work and thus impacts the erection cost.Another area where erector labor costs are impacted is in the column splice locations. When possible, I always tried to set column splices about 4′ above top of steel of the elevated floor. This allowed erectors to set lower columns sections, bolt a few beams in place at the elevated floor to hold the column in place, and then have that steel to stand on to bolt up the column splice easily. It seems like a small thing but erectors appreciate it. Plus, it shows them you are thinking about how a building actually goes together, rather than just focusing on what a piece of paper says. The highest compliment I even received while I was designing chemical plants was when a contractor told me that I was the only engineer he had ever worked with that thought like a contractor. High praise indeed!4.Do you remember all of those drops we talked about before that are laying around in the fabricator’s bone yard? Well all of that is “free steel” for him because it is already paid for. If he can find a way to use it somewhere, it's pure profit for his business.Say you design some personnel access platforms or equipment support stands (light loads where almost any section will adequately carry the load) and your design calls for a bunch of W6x15 sections to be used. If the fabricator could use a heavier section (such as a W8x21) from his boneyard, that steel is free to him and represents pure profit. There is nothing wrong with using a heavier section as long as you don't encounter an interference with something else (equipment, piping, etc.). I always told my contractors (or the fabricators directly) during meetings immediately after contract award that I was open to proposed substitution of steel sizes on certain drawings. (For instance, I might say that substitution for all of the equipment supports and access platforms members on drawings 8–12 could be proposed and that I would review and approve them. Sometimes I might say that I was open to any heavier substitution as long as the section width and depth were marginally the same…or maybe just the flange width alone as an example). Do NOT try to get the fabricator to give you a credit just because he's using a drop. The point is to do him a favor early. It will come back to benefit you in the long run, trust me on that one.5.Take the time to just look at your overall design and see if all of the steel sizes seem to make sense on a gut level. You don't need to do hand calculations on every beam, but at least look to see if anything seems odd. Is there a relatively light beam in the middle of a bunch of heavier steel? Is there a heavy beam in the middle of a lot of lighter sections. Maybe there's a reason…and maybe there is an error in the load inputs of your design program. You will develop a sixth sense about this over your career if you regularly step back and take in your whole design from time to time.","227,120 followers",Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,510,11.9K,117.6M,https://www.quora.com/Being-a-structural-engineer-what-is-the-toughest-project-Gopalkrishna-Vishwanath-ever-designed

If a computer could calculate many quadrillions of moves per microsecond, perhaps it could find a forced draw with perfect play, or maybe even a forced win for white. My guess is that there would be many quadrillions of different ways to draw, but not a single forced win.Simpler games like checkers have been solved, but the computing power required to calculate all possible move trees for chess is beyond our current technology, and maybe beyond what the laws of physics allow for possible future technologies - at least when trying to solve it in a reasonable timeframe. However, given an incredible amount of time, like billions of years, a computer with an insane amount of hard drives could eventually create 32 piece tablebases, although I don’t know what amount of space or volume that would occupy, or if there are enough raw materials on Earth to create that much hard drive space.Currently I believe that tablebases have only been created for 7 pieces or less. Anything more than that explodes into the horizon effect, where chess engines have to limit their analysis using some sort of heuristics or algorithms to narrow their focus. By the way, a tablebase is a complete solution for a given amount of pieces. So an endgame tablebase for King vs. King and Rook can be solved in every possible variation. Even the current tablebases take up terabytes worth of space, which is pretty crazy considering how small the file size would be for some simple chess notation.The big question is whether or not chess is a forced win for white. Everything we know based on super-strong chess engines indicates that white has the advantage. But does white have an inherently insurmountable advantage with perfect play? Probably not. In chess there is always a way to weasel out of an attack with solid defense from the start.In my opinion, the vastness and complexity of chess is what makes it so beautiful. If it were solvable, it would take all of the magic away. When grandmasters draw games based on well-known theoretical openings, it is painfully boring. Draws are boring. Decisive wild unexpected strategies are interesting. Whenever a player goes into deep space nine and unleashes a counterintuitive or deep positional combination, the magic of chess is revealed. Whenever a material disadvantage is overcome with a wild ace in the hole, the magic of chess is revealed.

Assessing millions of positions a second sounds all well and good, but there are trillions upon trillions of positions and a complex queen sacrifice standing between Stockfish and winning this game as White. Those trillions of positions are merely what’s required to solveIt’s possible to prove that certain positions in Chess are bad, both practically and scientifically because, in the former case, a decent Chess player can typically, satisfactorily judge when one side has some severe disadvantage with inadequate or no compensation. In the latter case, those positions will eventually lead to a loss by force and thus it may be theoretically possible to calculate all lines to a loss. However, it’s completely impossible to verify the difference between a move that’s ‘merely adequate’ or ‘best’. There is no reason to believe that an engine preferring 1. c4 to 1. Nf3, for instance, has any bearing on which is better.The vast gulf of superiority between neural networks over traditional brute force engines and the proven deficiencies of neural networks which sometimes result in them losing to these inferior programs is sufficient to sink the notion that Chess programming is anywhere close to providing best play. One might say that there is no such thing as being good at Chess and that it’s more precise to describe one Chess-playing entity as ‘less bad’ than another, rather than ‘better.’Nonetheless. Even in the absence of the aforementioned factors that prove all Chess-playing entities are far from perfection, perfection will remain empirically unprovable because you could convert the entire universe into computer memory without being able to store every Chess position.For","50,650 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,906,4.4K,85.5M,https://www.quora.com/Being-a-structural-engineer-what-is-the-toughest-project-Gopalkrishna-Vishwanath-ever-designed
