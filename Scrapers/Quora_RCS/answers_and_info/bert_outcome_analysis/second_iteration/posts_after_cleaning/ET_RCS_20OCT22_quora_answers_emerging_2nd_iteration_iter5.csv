0,"I think your question is ill informed.Mining especially Bitcoin requires internet, electricity, and ASIC hardware to mine. There’s a physical cost in terms of space, physical cost of funds to buy, etc. Bitcoin has a finite max supply. Its a deflationary cryptocurrency that is an interesting financial experiment. It certainly has more trust from many people than the fiat money system like the US Dollar that can print trillions of dollars at will encouraging potential rampant inflation.",0 followers,Patrick Celaya,4.4K,64,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Cryptocurrency-not-generating-out-of-thin-air-Why-it-is-valuable-if-it-can-be-mined-without-any-physical-restrictions-How-having-thousands-of-cryptocurrencies-having-billions-of-dollars-value-each-are-justifiable

The depression stage of the market cycle is typified by:When these factors are present it is very difficult for the market to make much of a rally, because as soon as it does, people start to remember the times they were burned recently, and get very nervous to hold their money in the markets.This is a complete contrast to the bull market of 2017 when investors:You can start to see that these two market states are a long way from each other. The jump between them is not a fast one, it is a slow one. It has taken us about 14 months to get to where we are now, so it would be safe to assume that it would take a minimum of 14 months (usually 2–3x that amount of time) to return to a positive and optimistic state.During that time price could do anything, however, it is unlikely to start going up, without stopping.As we talked about earlier, due to the excessive risk avoidance and inability to foresee a positive future, as the price starts to increase, instead of seeing the potential for more gains as investors did in 2017 they see the potential for more and violent losses.So they begin to sell out their positions because they see nothing but the potential for future losses. This, in turn, causes the market to falter, making more people sell their positions, and then it begins to reverse completely eating up all of the gains from the previous rally.This smaller cycle plays out a number of times within the larger cycle until there has been enough increase in the price for people to start to think “maybe this time will be different” and instead of selling out early, they hold on a little longer, just to see what happens.This is the tipping point back to a bullish trend.What you need to do to capitalize right nowThe TraderRight now Bitcoin is moving sideways with sharp bursts both up and down. This is algorithmic trading (bots) moving the markets, this is only possible due to a lack of human intervention, aka, human buyers.The InvestorInvestors thrive while the markets are depressed. And right now, the cryptocurrency market is extremely depressed.As an intelligent investor your job now, in a bear market, is to find the projects that are as close to their “book value” or their net current assets as possible.When you find those projects, you need to do further research to:Then, when you know the price is low, and the project is active - you have an investment.That doesn’t mean that the price cannot go down, we all know how irrational markets are. But it does mean that there is a high likelihood that eventually the market will correctly value your investment, or better, overvalue it.When it starts to become largely overvalued, you begin to take profits and look for new investments.Right now is the first time in years that there are actual bargains available, investing safely in a bull market is impossible - investing now, is what we need to do.If you enjoyed reading this, please leave an upvote! :)P.s.Google “Boss Crypto” to see the trades, portfolio and analysis put out by the #1 trading and investing academy.",UNKNOWN,Md.

The fact that the United States has both is why most international investors feel safe exchanging goods and services via the US Dollar.This wasn’t always the case. The British Pound was the reserve currency prior to the World Wars. The British Empire’s Pound was secured by an elaborate network of Imperial supply chains and backed by the might of the Royal Navy. This made the Pound an attractive currency to conduct international trade. It was almost guaranteed that if you did business through the British Pound, that your transactions would safely reach their foreign destination.World War I and II changed everything. The Germans employed a U-Boat strategy that quite effectively sunk more British ships than they could manufacture. Combined with the amount of money the British Empire borrowed to win the wars, they were forced to essentially sell their rights as a reserve currency to those damned Yanks, in exchange for supplies (and eventually an alliance).This handover of reserve currency status was solidified in the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement. Much less known about this agreement was the brutal disagreements occurring behind closed doors between the Americans and British. British Economist, John Maynard Keynes, and American Economist, Henry Morgenthau, had yelling matches about how to transition the postwar economic system. But the Americans had all the leverage in the negotiations, and they ultimately pushed their agenda forward.This became known as theThe Bretton Woods system is built on 4 pillars:2. Bribing up an alliance - The United States then offers3. Sanctions - Sanctions are when the United States is mad at someone, but doesn’t want to go to war with them. This is how the Soviet Union was dealt with, and a tactic used aggressively by the Trump administration. The US can choose to bribe all the other countries of the world to stop trading with a rival, under the threat they will cut their access off too. They do this by preventing all USD transactions to a specific country, and using their Navy to block direct supply routes to that nation. It effectively isolates the nation’s economy, making their economy extremely fragile. The Soviet Union only survived as long as they did because they had sufficient food, water and oil resources for self sustainability. Not everyone has that luxury. Which brings us to the last weapon the US has used, and was used, to bring down the Soviet Union.4. The PetroDollar - When China opened up its market to the US network in 1974, this allowed the United States to withdraw from Vietnam. The US then turned it’s focus to the Middle East, where massive oil fields were churning out enough energy for the entire global consumption. The US then established an agreement with the Saudis in the 1970s to exclusively trade their oil exclusively for US Dollars. In exchange, the United States promised to use its military to protect their interests. It was this agreement that allowed the US to drown the Soviet economy into submission (by flooding the global market with cheap Saudi oil). But the Catch 22, was that it was this agreement that has dragged the US to fighting a religious war they have no idea how to fight.Global reserve currencies are historically rare. Throughout history, currency domination was usually established by regional powers, such as the Roman, Persian, and Han Empires. It wasn’t until the British that one national currency went global. And their currency domination lasted for only 2 centuries (essentially from the Seven Years War to the end of World War II). This forced the British throughout this 200 year period (1763 to 1945) to get involved in just about every global conflict, since every global conflict affected the stability of their currency network.The British learned the hard way that while controlling the global currency was strategically expedient, it was ultimately unsustainable. They found themselves being forced to fight conflicts that weren’t directly in the interest of their own nation. In other words, they were forced to increasingly deploy their military when there wasn’t exactly a threat to their national security, but instead a threat to their currency stability. This was expensive, costly, and eventually dragged them into bankruptcy once Japan, Germany and Italy forced them to cash out on all their protection guarantees.While it is doubtful a foreign currency, or Bitcoin for that matter, will ever challenge the supremacy of the US Dollar (at least in the near future), it is possible that the responsibility of maintaining a global currency could jeopardize the financial well-being of the United States. It is an exhausting responsibility, with global headaches and annoyances. It is why since 1945 we’ve had soldiers fighting in rice paddies in Indochina, cocaine fields in Colombia, oil compounds in the Islamic world and the jungles of sub-Saharan Africa.Sometimes I think the British conned us in 1944 when they turned over the reserve currency.Those tricky bastards.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Is-Cryptocurrency-not-generating-out-of-thin-air-Why-it-is-valuable-if-it-can-be-mined-without-any-physical-restrictions-How-having-thousands-of-cryptocurrencies-having-billions-of-dollars-value-each-are-justifiable
