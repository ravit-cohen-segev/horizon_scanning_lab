1,I understand their scepticism.They do not have a manned vehicle capable of reaching the moon. They are being asked to participate in an international mission in which essentially all the key elements will be American.The reason for the gateway is essentially a compromise due to the limitations of SLS. I respect that they may choose to take their experience and go it alone or seek another partner like China,6 followers,Mats Andersson,3.6K,19.9K,366M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-practical-uses-of-super-computing-in-government-apart-from-code-breaking

US is trying to ruin Russian aviation projects right now, just read about US sanctions which disrupted supply of Japanese carbon fiber for(these big panels are NOT solar panels, these are radiators to radiate nuclear reactor heat, necessary to run its electricity generating turbine)By the way, this video is not just the next computer graphics art, this is about a very real thing which is at least 20 years ahead of US:The main problem right now is that Russia currently has no super-heavy rocket to deliver this nuclear tug into high orbit where its reactor will be activated, so it will be launched only by the year 2030… and it makes little sense to use it for moon exploration, such slowly but steadily accelerating vehicles are best for far space.I am a big fan of space exploration but I don’t think that lunar gateway is a good idea. First of all, SpaceX Starship (if and when successful) can reach moon directly. Also, I personally think that right now manned flights to the moon make no sense at all - simply because Moon is just 3 seconds away for robot operators and rower drivers from Earth. It could be much cheaper and more efficient to invest into lunar robotics and remote exploration and construction to eventually create safe environment for humans using at least some local resources like water, building materials etc. It makes very little sense to deliver humans and everything they need to survive from our planet. Perhaps only to test equipment for manned flight to Mars… but there will be no manned landing on Mars in any nearest future despite all these bold twitters of Elon Musk… it will be simply prohibited before scientists will make sure that humans will not harm potential Mars life (perhaps underground life but nevertheless) and that returning humans will not bring any life from Mars. All what will be allowed is orbiting Mars and remotely controlling the same robots and rowers as we should have on Moon.By the way, Russia is already working on space robots, one of them, humanoid robot FEDOR even visited ISS but returned quickly, perhaps his human coworkers did not like the competition :)‘Let’s go’: Russia launches creepy humanoid robot Fedor into spaceMeet Skybot F-850, the Humanoid Robot Russia Is Launching into SpaceUPDATE 1: actually, there is some new information about Moon exploration using nuclear space tug. Yes, it will take about 200 days to deliver 10 ton payload to lunar orbit, not much in comparison with the most powerful chemical rockets. However, nuclear tug payload (a powerful radar) will get 0.5 megawatts of electricity, so this radar will be able to scan Moon several kilometers under surface. Of course this radar also can be used to scan Venus, Mars and even US military underground facilities - but this is another story, maybe Russian military is not interested like US military is not interested in using SpaceX Starlink to control drones, it’s all about science and gamers in remote Alaskan locations, right?UPDATE 2: it can be rather neutron emitter than radar, thanks Andrei for his comments.","1,371 followers",Julie Ritt,602,659,3.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-skeptical-about-participating-in-the-lunar-gateway

In the spring of 2019, NASA also announced the Artemis project of developing a sustainable human presence on the Moon.The Roscosmos chief earlier said in an interview with TASS that the Russian space agency was ready to participate in the international Lunar Orbital Gateway project only on an equal footing with NASA.

My inner monologue was often variations of: “Why are you mad? I’m literally agreeing with you. You’re creating a conflict where there isn’t one.”It usually manifested itself when decisions had to be made that affected the women and myself. Like this:Woman in my life:It took me about ten years of marriage, and about seven years of having mostly female coworkers, before I stopped being confused by:The tendency of women in my life to seek out unnecessary friction.That is, why they’d get annoyed or even angry with me when I agreed with them on something. My inner monologue was often variations of: “Why are you mad? I’m literally agreeing with you. You’re creating a conflict where there isn’t one.”It usually manifested itself when decisions had to be made that affected the women and myself. Like this:Woman in my life:Me:Woman:Me:Woman:Me:Woman: [Visible anger.]My inner monologue:Finally, after one such unnecessary conflict with my wife, she told me a secret: being agreeable all of the time is not a good thing. Not having opinions about most things doesn’t mean that you’re easy to get along with; it means that you don’t care. At least, that’s how women interpret it.So, I started forming opinions about things when women asked for my opinion, and it’s worked wonders. Even if, deep down, I’d be happy with any decision, I still state a preference for one decision, and defend it if necessary.This has helped me out a lot at home and at work. Just last month, there was a schedule change and my three coworkers (all women) and I had to decide on the order in which we’d take our breaks, since only one of us can go on break at any given time. The truth was that I would have been happy with any break time because, honestly, it’s not like we’re doing manual labor and need to rest our bodies. I do half of my teaching while sitting down anyway, writing on an iPad which is then projected onto a screen for my students to see. I never leave work exhausted. Anyway, my coworkers were putting a lot of thought into their requested break times, so I figured I should, too. I picked a time, and, even though it was a time that another one wanted (I didn’t know that when I picked it), they all seemed to appreciate the fact that I had an opinion, and then built the rest of the break schedule around what I wanted.Experience has taught me that if I’d just taken whatever was left after my coworkers picked what they wanted, the women would have left the meeting angry at me for being so agreeable.It’s like there’s a base level of friction women are comfortable with, and that level is above the “zero level” where a lot of men, like me, dwell.I think this is why the only people I know who actually enjoy reality television are women.

And it mostly boils down with agreeing with everything that she says. Why? Because that's how evolution of men's mind has happened. Most of the things are binary. There is little space for a 3rd option.So, when a man agrees with you womenfolk, watch out: there are 3 possible scenarios:He is not sharing which of the three it is, not because he doesn't want to but because he is not used to being asked. Suppressing emotions is how men are raised in this world except certain arenas like sports or cars etc.. And that is why the mindless furore they create over there. However, a rock solid foundation for marriage builds when its the 3rd scenario. The best way to make a man respond is not by pestering for a response but by making him aware that its joint decision and his input counts.

Nothing below 7 or 6. Point is the vast majority of men will find Margot Robbie to be very attractive both sexually, physically and personality wise.Now let’s ask 10 straight women and 10 bisexual women whether they find Micheal B Jordan attractive from a range of 1–10You will get a variety of answers, all giving 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.Some will even give him zero, some bisexual women will say they prefer women and so.The point is you will get a more varied answer from women and what they find attractive.It’s hard to get an objective answer on what heterosexual women find attractive.There are women who will say women are just as visual as men and then there are women who say women are less visual than men.There are women who will say they find feminine men attractive and then there are women who say feminine men aren’t attractive.There are women who say the most sexually attractive thing a man does is arrange his books in alphabetical order and then there are women who are angry that men are considered attractive for doing the most basic thing in life.If there is something one woman finds attractive about men, another woman will criticize and make fun of men trying to appeal to that woman and women like her.Whenever there is an attempt at appealing to heterosexual women, there is going to be a loud group of straight women who will say “ this is not what straight women want” even though there are some straight women who specifically find it appealing to them.Dude, straight men, and dare I say even some lesbians are able to find men attractive more than an actual straight woman does.At this point, I am convinced that the majority of the women are not straight and are just trying to appeal to the heteronormative structure just by looking at how confusing it is to pinpoint what straight women find attractive especially sexually.Hell majority of straight women prefer lesbian porn even if there is porn that was made for a straight woman. The majority of “straight” women focus more on women than they do on men.Ladies it’s 2022 just come out of the closet already and stop this confusion","358,121 followers",Sean Kernan,3.6K,5.6K,723.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-about-women-that-confuses-men-so-much

No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. These subtilised interpretations are highly manifold according to their nature and have almost nothing to do with the original text. For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions.","114,984 followers",Daveed Phoenix,723,9.9K,159.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-practical-uses-of-super-computing-in-government-apart-from-code-breaking
