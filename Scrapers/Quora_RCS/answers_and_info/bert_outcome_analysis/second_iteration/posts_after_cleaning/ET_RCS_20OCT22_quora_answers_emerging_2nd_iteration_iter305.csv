It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of cold war underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some tens of meters away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1980 - 1992) could not provide the driver energy required to produce full fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed to make full ICF fusion ignition with energy gain work (driver energy >20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly producing full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel. These experiments were once classified but DOE declassified about half of Hailte-Centurion fusion related information and allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl reveal the declassified material.During the cold war LANL and LLNL did preliminary pure fusion device designs but were not successful with 1970s fusion driver technology. In the year 2001 DOE permitted disclosure of the fact that the US had a well organized and well funded sustained effort to produce ultra-clean pure fusion devices.RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html(see section C of this document)NIF is currently only capable of delivering about 2.15 MJ of energy to the windows of the fusion hohlraum (and about 26 kJ of X-ray energy to the actual fusion capsule holding the fusion fuel). NIF produces short bright powerful light pulses on the order of about 100 femtoseconds in width but delivers only 1/1000th the energy to the fusion capsule as was deposited in successful practical cold war Halite-Centurion experimental field tests that produced full ICF fusion ignition and burning plasma.Losses inside the hohlraum reduce delivered laser energy to the actual fusion capsule to around 26 kilojoules of energy. NIF is currently not capable of producing full fusion ignition but succeeds in operating in a ""alpha-heating"" regime that occurs just prior to full fusion ignition.Graph showing contributions of Alpha Heating at NIFWhat is lacking in current ICF fusion experiments to support building of practical ICF fusion power plants is a fusion driver with characteristics close enough to the driver employed by LANL and LLNL in Halite-Centurion tests to permit full fusion ignition with energy gain. The needed driver should be capable of delivering greater than 20 MJ into a focused spot less than a 2 mm in diameter in time of less than 3 nanoseconds. The current NIF laser driver is capable of delivering about 2 MJ total energy and is only able to achieve ""alpha heating"" phase of fusion operation - a stage that immediately precedes fusion ignition. LASNEX and HYDRA computer simulations of the mid-1990s on which LLNL based the engineering design of the NIF laser were overly optimistic in predicting the required fusion driver characteristics to produce ignition. Failure of the mid-1990s LASNEX and HYDRA simulations resulted in NIF being built too small to achieve the goal of fusion ignition and for NIF to serve as the technical basis of the LIFE ICF fusion power plant. It must also however be admitted that beside driver energy and power, there are other slightly lower priority (but still important) unsolved engineering issues for ICF including implosion symmetry and plasma instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor) that rob energy from ICF plasma when it nears fusion conditions. Use of a more robust fusion driver such as was employed in cold war Halite-Centurion X-ray initiated DT fusion experiments permitted slightly less than optimum symmetry and mild plasma instabilities and still work under slightly sub-optimum conditions and produce DT fusion ignition with production of energy gain.While ICF pure fusion is being held back by inadequate fusion driver technology (lasers or particle accelerators) - the four decade sustained progress in the field of High Power Pulsed Lasers has been phenomenal. Fast Pulse lasers are rapidly improving relative to other possible ICF fusion drivers. While lasers are getting more powerful - they are also getting physically smaller and cheaper to build and operate.Progress in the power of Fast Pulse Lasers exceeds sustained progress in any other technical field (including semiconductors - Moore’s Law) -High Power Pulsed LasersIt is however the case that in the current environment of sustained rapid technical progress, laser drivers are still too small to reliably produce ICF DT fusion ignition. Successful ICF fusion ignition requires both high delivered power combined with sufficient total energy to produce full fusion conditions in the ICF fusion capsule.Practical Commercial Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants that actually make commercial electricity (and in a time frame that makes a difference) -Dr. Ralph Moir has designed several Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants. His ideas are very good and should be given greater attention and study.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",340 followers,Payam Adlparvar,817,530,2.5M,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

This will actually prove to be important in how fast fusion can be brought to commercial reality and rapidly deployed worldwide.Nuclear Fusion – Smaller Cheaper & SoonerWhile it is common to consider D-T fusion when making comparisons in fission versus fusion arguments, in a long term perspective it is probably better to use D-D fusion to represent the fusion case.D-D fusion is cheaper and more long term sustainable than D-T fusion (there is at present only enough worldwide supply of Tritium to keep a 1 GWe D-T fusion power plant fueled and running for 2 months while there is enough Deuterium in the world’s oceans, 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons, to supply all of the earth’s need for power at a 17 TW level for 29 billion years).D-D fusion is also more energetic by weight of fuel than D-T fusion when all fusion reactions including side-chains go to completion. Of all nuclear reactions (fission or fusion) – D-D fusion of pure Deuterium separated from sea water produces the highest energy yield per kilogram of fuel consumed.It is to be regretted that D-D fusion is slightly more complex than D-T fusion and produces energy through four reactions instead of one reaction like D-T. The additional complexity of four versus one reaction may tend to put off science writers and commentators – so DT fusion routinely gets more coverage in the popular press. In a longer term perspective, it is probable that D-D fusion will be of greater overall historical significance and will in the future produce a large portion of future energy required to power our world.The four D-D fusion reactions (and the net effect reaction):D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:The energy output that results from all four D-D fusion reactions is 3.439248 x 10^8 MJ/kg. The temperature a fusion reactor must achieve to produce an efficient D-D plasma burn is 350 million K.Nuclear Fusion Summary – Prospects for breakthrough commercial reactors 2018-2025Brian Wang of the Next Big Future Blog updates hisThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium. The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy. In the year 2018 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.While nuclear fusion is frequently derisively denounced as ""always only 50 years away"", are there currently real reasons for optimism?Regulatory obstacles to nuclear fusion reactors are currently much lower than obstacles impeding the development of innovative nuclear fission reactors. While this may not seem like a significant thing, I believe that it will prove to be important in how fast fusion can be brought out in commercial forms[1].Tom McGuire, lead project engineering at the Lockheed skunkworks and chief designer of the Lockheed Compact Fusion Device has announce the intension to build a new prototype CFD reactor a year until a commercially viable fusion power plant is demonstrated. McGuire expects to achieve a commercial power generating reactor in 5 years (or 5 experimental prototype development cycles). This kind of intense development effort is not possible in the fission universe as a result of obstructive NRC regulation.Conclusion _ While a harder physics problem, small fusion will be available in commercial forms before any form of new Gen-IV fission reactor.Robert Steinhaus's answer to What's our current progress on nuclear fusion power and what problems remain ?[1] - Fission versus Fusion?If you want to innovate and build a fission reactor you need from NRC -1) A design certification to ensure your basic reactor design is safe – cost ~$200 million2) A COL license to allow you to construct and operate your fission reactor – cost ~ $60 million3) Once licensed, you will have to pay each year an operating fee to NRC of ~$5 million dollars whether your reactor is operating or not – whether it is producing electricity or process heat or not.4) A license to obtain fission nuclear fuel for your prototype reactor must be obtained from NRC - private sale or purchase of nuclear fuels is illegal and can result in jail time.5) A Waste Confidence Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared and submitted to NRC to describe how you plan to sequester any nuclear waste produced by your fission reactor prototype. NRC must approve your plan before you are allowed to allow your reactor to go critical and produce any fission power. Your will need to pay NRC staff evaluating your Environmental Impact Statement at a rate of $273 an hour until such time as NRC staff are satisfied with all elements of your plan.6) When you decide you can no longer continue operating your prototype reactor, you will have to pay NRC during reactor decommissioning. Former reactor operators are required to pay NRC staff at a rate of $273 per hour of time they are involved in supervising the decommissioning of your reactor prototype.In contrast, the obstacles to Fusion reactor innovation –1) No regulatory obstacles currently exit in the US preventing prototyping of fusion reactors.2) You can freely and legally build fusion reactors in your home basement or at school without interference of any kind from NRC.3) You can legally buy high purity fusion fuels (D2O – which can be electrolyzed to 99.99% pure Deuterium) on e-Bay for less than $10.4) OPEN SOURCE design guides and plans can be freely downloaded on the internet for several good fusion reactor designs. Helpful Face book and Web Forum resources exits to permit sharing of fusion technical know-how and for group solving of problems with near real-time responses to difficulties.5) There are no defined reactor decommissioning costs for fusion reactor prototypes.Engineers design and build things.Your chance of rapidly designing and building innovative ideas and deploying large numbers of nuclear reactors are much better in the fusion realm than in the fission area as a result of current over regulation of fission nuclear.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

The best estimate of the total power being radiated in light from the sun isHowever the star Sirius has about 50 times the Sun’s luminosity, and there are stars that emit 20–30 thousand times as much power, such very bright stars are, however, much shorter lived than is the Sun.There is a small additional radiant energy flux in neutrinos and there is some energy released from the Sun in the form of the solar wind as well. All of this energy originates from fusion, and the Sun has been fusing hydrogen to helium for perhaps 4.5 billion years. However the rate of fusion has not been constant over that whole time but instead is slowly growing as the Sun ages. So in this sense, your question, how much energy does fusion produce is not terribly well-defined. One could say that in all likelihood most of the radiant energy in the universe is right now being produced by fusion. There are other contributors too, massive black holes, gamma ray bursts, supernovae, neutron star mergers, black hole mergers and other such exotic and very distant phenomena, but they are not dominant.At the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun, the solar luminosity translates to a radiant power per unit area of 1.361 kW/m^2 at the top of Earth’s atmosphere at solar minimum, and 1.362 kW/m^2 at solar maximum, a number which is called the Solar irradiance. The Sun’s total luminosity varies with the 11 year sunspot cycle by a small amount. The Sun is a weakly variable star, and as I pointed out the total power it produces is increasing over geological timescales.That 1.362 kW/m^2 arriving at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere translates into aThe integrated value of that power incident at the surface is enormous - roughly 1 hours worth of the Sun’s total output, if and this is a very big if, it could be captured, stored, and used, would be about equal to the total annual energy consumption of all of humanity. Practically speaking, however, it is a massive engineering project to capture that much energy and use it. Storing energy in particular is an extremely costly proposition with current technologies.Now, as to artificially producing fusion, I am sorry to say this, but it is a very, very difficult problem. One can’t duplicate in a laboratory on Earth, the conditions that exist deep in the core of the Sun, where gravity confines hydrogen and helium ions at a density of about 150 times the density of water, and at a temperature of about 15,000,000 degrees Kelvin, so that the protons continually collide and re-collide with each other, very occasionally fusing in an extremely slow reaction in which deuterium is formed.What has to be done on Earth is to use other fuel than protons, and people are trying with deuterium and tritium, but the creation of such high densities as exist in the Sun at the needed temperature for a large amount of hydrogen fuel, and for a very long time, so as to produce fusion as the Sun does, is simply not an option on Earth. Most of the approaches to creating fusion power artificially work by producing very high temperatures instead, much higher than those existing in the core of the Sun. There are a number of approaches to doing it, none of which are at the present time practical.The one approach to producing fusion energy that really can be said to work right now is the mechanism employed in thermonuclear weapons, in which a small nuclear fission weapon is used to very efficiently compress, heat and ignite a secondary containing fusion fuel. But employing nuclear weapons as sources of energy is not likely to go over well with the public, given their general attitude towards nuclear power, and there are obvious practical problems and also serious dangers associated with such an approach.So now, and for the foreseeable future, I suspect that the closest we will get to practical fusion power is probably 93 million miles, which is about 1 AU, the mean distance from the Sun.I sincerely hope that I am very wrong, but I have been watching the discussions of fusion energy for almost forty years now, and the technical problems that are involved are simply very difficult problems which are arising from fundamental physics. It is best to concentrate on means of producing useful energy that are actually available right now, in order to be able to maintain civilization at a high rate of energy use until a transition to a far lower and constant rather than exponentially growing world population, and a lower overall demand for energy to do useful work, can be completed.That’s not to say don’t do any research into fusion, but it would be very irresponsible to claim that it will be solving the world’s energy problems any time soon.",825 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors

You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees.

In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).------Large tokamak magnetic fusion designers often tend to discount the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction because it is not possible to achieve the necessary fusion reaction rates and break-even energy with D-D fusion using tokamaks and stellarator devices such as we currently are able build. The situation is different, however, with Inertial Confinement Fusion which typically employs a fusion plasma that are literally 10^11 times more dense than the typical ion plasma densities used in MCF tokamaks or stellarators.The power than can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the second power of the plasma ion density. Even small improvements in plasma ion density will result in significant improvements in the performance of a fusion experiment.There is an impressively large Range of plasma density in current and planned fusion experimentsThere is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between MCF and ICF fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV-------Fusion and neutronsDT and DD fusion release large amounts of their fusion energy in the form of fast neutrons.The task of shielding fast neutrons requires• Fast Neutrons (E >1 MeV) must first be thermalized with highneutron scattering materials (typically materials that have a high percentage of light atoms like hydrogen)• These thermal neutrons can then be absorbed or shielded with material having high cross sections for neutron absorptionAbsorption of thermalized neutrons can be done by relatively light materials like polyethylene plastic unlike gamma radiation that require lots of high-z material (lead, concrete, water) to absorb the penetrating gamma.LLNL's Dr. Ralph Moir has pioneered several molten salt fusion reactor concepts (HyLife II and PACER Revisited). A thick liquid falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorber like 50 micron particles of Boron Carbide as a slurry can absorb damaging fast neutrons. Such a thick falling wall of molten salt can effectively protect fusion chamber structure and largely prevent neutron activation of fusion reactor materials. This permits molten salt ICF fusion reactors to have long 30+ year commercial lifetimes and to at reactor end of life produce little or no neutron activated waste.Slide comparing fission and various fusion reactions from Professor Gerald KulcinskiThere are actually rather good reasons to believe that when nuclear fusion is commercially introduced, it will in short order form the basis of very commercially competitive power plants that will deliver reliable, cheap energy to all in the world that need energy.Fusion’s near term commercial potential -Not all approaches to nuclear fusion will have identical commercial characteristics. Some approaches to nuclear fusion will not in the end be able to produce any actual energy beyond what is required to operate the fusion experiment and as a result will effectively become fusion research dead ends. Other fusion approaches including some that currently receive high levels of funding and international support may ultimately reach break-even energy, but these approaches to fusion may after scaling end up so extraordinarily complex and impractically huge in size may that they end up being commercially uncompetitive with fossil fuel and renewable energy power plants. Such a large experimental fusion physics demonstration may perhaps be built only a single time as a kind of technology proof of principle, but then go no further and never get built in any significant numbers by communities needing cost competitive electrical power.Plasma Density matters when competing to produce cheap energy -Approaches to fusion that routinely use very low density plasma, like tokamaks (ITER) and stellarators (W7-x) will have to be physically larger and contain a much greater volume of fusion plasma than fusion devices that routinely operate on denser plasma. There is literally a 10^11 difference in operating plasma density at fusion conditions between Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices like tokamaks and stellarators and Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Experiments like NIF. This is a huge natural competitive advantage to ICF fusion in terms of potential commercial competitiveness.Comparison between the fusion chamber volume of an Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment (NIF) versus a Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiment (ITER) -(notice man in lower right corner for scale)Those who advocate Magnetic Confinement fusion devices will be quick to point out however that ICF fusion currently requires a large stationary football field sized laser fusion driver to ignite the small high plasma density ICF fusion capsules. This is true, but the size and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers is dropping very rapidly (and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers are also dropping at a rapid rate) and the impact of the laser fusion driver is destined to be a shrinking contributor to ICF fusion power plant physical size and cost.The power that a pulse laser fusion driver can deliver has increased roughly by a factor of 1000 every decade for the last 40 years. This is in fact a stronger sustained technical advance than even Moore’s law (transistors on a CPU chip).Cost of fusion power generators that can operate using high density fusion plasma -As previously mentioned, the physically smallest and least costly commercial fusion power plants of the future will probably operate using the highest density fusion plasma. Approaches to fusion that cannot operate on a least medium density plasma (10^18 ions/cm^3) will probably not be able to compete, head to head, with fossil fuel or renewable energy power plants.LPP Fusion is currently a private sector small fusion leader in the quest for fusion and is expected to use medium density fusion plasma in their Dense Plasma Focus fusion device. LPP Fusion has produced the following slide as a cost goal for their small modular commercial fusion device.These is a respectably low and impressive cost estimate for small fusion.The Department of Energy EIA's findings suggest that natural gas–fired power plants are cheaper to build with overnight capital costs ranging fromLPP Fusion’s DPF device would be 10X or more cheaper to build and would produce 10X cheaper electricity than the cheapest current form of natural gas power plant.ICF fusion power plants that use the densest fusion plasma have the potential to be the most cost competitive of all small fusion approaches when the technology becomes commercially available.As fusion power plants advance to commercial reality over the next decade, they should improve in power density and decrease in cost.Small Fusion: step by step and one step at a time.Effort to bring fusion to commercial reality will be rewarded.The investment in fusion technology will be justified and the low cost power that fusion will generate will lift billions of people around the world currently without any access to electricity out of chronic grinding poverty and want.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors
23,"Nope.Where the fun happens in a fusion power plantThe promise of fusion power is not inexpensive electrical energy or some great technological advances. There are trifling matters told to the general public who are unable to comprahend what awsome gains fusion power really offers.Fusion would enable humans to maintain an industrial civilization on Earth or elsewhere, essentially indefinitely and independent of abundance of any ore or material. That is the true promise of fusion. The only limiting power left to us would be water and our supplies of water on Earth, while usingNope.Where the fun happens in a fusion power plantThe promise of fusion power is not inexpensive electrical energy or some great technological advances.

Yes, it’s clean and offers essentially infinite amount of power just about anywhere on Earth. Sure, that’s great and all, but it pales with the fact the term “finite resource” can be cosigned to history. We wouldn’t even need the Sun any more.

24,"As much as you want. The trouble is that so far, every experiment involving atomic fusion has either required more energy to get it started than it produced, or only managed to produce a minuscule amount of excess energy before the containment vessel failed and the experiment ended.Theoretically, it should be possible, but not just yet. For over 60 years, those working in the field have said that there would be working nuclear fusion plants within 30 years. They are still saying that, 60 years later; and I expect they willAs much as you want.

IIRC, about 0.7% of the mass is converted into energy.Yes, but you end up using a lot more energy to make the proper conditions than you get out of it.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/After-its-been-said-for-decades-we-are-20-years-away-from-nuclear-fusion-how-close-are-we-really-to-real-widespread-energy-positive-reactors
