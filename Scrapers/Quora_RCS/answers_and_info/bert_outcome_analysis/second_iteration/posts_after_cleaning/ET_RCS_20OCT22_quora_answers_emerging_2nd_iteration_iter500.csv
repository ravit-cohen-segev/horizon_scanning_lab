Whilst we gamed we talked not just about which was the best position to win or game tactics, we really talked. He didn’t have the pressure of me asking him questions about his day, he was occupied enough to just let it out. He opened up about serious issues but it wasn’t made into a huge deal with me fretting and worrying ( don’t get me wrong in my mind I was worried and fretting and had a million and one questions) but because I wasn’t pressuring him he was able to open up as weird as it sounds but it was an eye opener for me. I mean do you ever feel sweaty and nervous when sat across from someone knowing you have some difficult things to talk about and know they are staring right at you watching every facial expression and movement whilst you blurt all this hard info out. ever sat in the car and been able to have the exact same conversation with the same person and find it easier because their eyes are looking out the window, and not staring at you? I have and I find it easier. Sorry I’m going off here. But for my son it was like that. I learn so much from my son when we game together.I have learnt my son is extremely funny, he’s tactful and has a strong leader ship, he’s clever in life and virtual gaming sense.I know so many people will say ‘surely you could have found this out with out gaming’ of course I knew all this before! But when my son and I are shut away from the world it’s just him and me, nothing else. Just us. no judgment (I would never bring judgment into my home at anytime of the day) and of course we have this closeness every where. We hike together, picnic out and bike rides. But in his room it’s his rules (to an extent) it’s his safe haven.I’m not sure that makes sense?But to answer your question, no, no you shouldn’t stop gaming with your child.

Still, I remember sitting next to my dad to watch him play old Sierra games (Kings Quest, Space Quest, and yes, even Leisure Suit Larry - my parents have never censored what I can play or watch), solving puzzles I wasn't able to on my own. After that it was discussing strategies with building cities in SimCity, or squad combat tactics in X-Com. We also had a Nintendo, and a Super Nintendo a few years after that came out. We would take turns playing games like Mario, Metal Gear, and a helicopter sim that I dont remember the name of anymore. This continued into my teenage years, where I now regret not spending more time with him.We also did plenty of outdoor activities. He taught me how to fish, tried to get me into golfing at a young age, and went to baseball games and practices. Looking back I think it was a good and healthy balance.My dad died unexpectedly 12 years ago when I was only 18. I'm now 30, and my wife is 4 months pregnant (yay!). One of the things I'm most excited about is being able to play games with my child, reliving those moments but this time as a dad. I miss those times with my dad the most, and can tell you they made me a better person.Keep a healthy balance with some outdoor activities, and enjoy that bonding time over video games. If the worry is on your child not figuring out solutions on their own, I'm sure you already provide guidance, but let them do the thinking and leg work until they need a hand. Just step that up incrementally as needed. Or at least that's my current plan on what I'll do in the future....",1 follower,Michael Kingsbury,1.9K,7.1K,6.5M,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-stop-playing-video-games-with-my-child

Video games can be an incredible learning tool. Also, be looking for ways that lessons in the video game can be applied to real life. It's amazing how many parallels can be found in games.Lastly, note that not all ""screen time"" is equal. Watching TV (passive) is different from playing Action video games (motor skills, quick response times) and is different from Puzzle games (critical thinking, imagination).Great question, keep up the great work!",17 followers,Justin Choy,1.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-stop-playing-video-games-with-my-child

In this regard, Brezhnev proclaimed the concept of ""developed socialism"" (basically, it was a propaganda cliche with far-fetched content).3) During Perestroika, Gorbachev adopted a housing construction program, according to which each family was to receive a separate apartment before 2000.4) There were grandiose plans for the reclamation of drylands. But they was not always take into account the preservation of the balance of natur. The most striking example is the use of the Kazakh rivers of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya, as a result of which the Aral Sea, which they fed, almost disappeared.There were plans for the full or partial transfer of river water in directions convenient for economic use. The most grave of them was the ""Plan for the transfer of northern rivers to the south,"" which envisaged change of direction of several huge Siberian rivers (approximately like the Mississippi) from north to south.5) In the second half of the 1980s, a line of modern airliners of various classes was developed, which in the 1990s were to replace the obsolete aircraft fleet of the USSR and the countries of the ""socialist camp"" (6) At the turn of the 1970s and 1980s, the project to create a gas turbine engine for commercial truck tractors was basically completed. It was supposed to become more economical, more reliable and more durable than diesel engines.7) The space station (orbital complex) Mir was planned to be replaced with a new one (Mir-2 project). In 1994, the base module of the station was supposed to be replaced with a new one using a reusable spacecraft of the Buran type.8) There was an intensive exploration program for Mars. Only its first stage (Phobos program) was completed (though not very successfully). In the 1990s, Mars rovers, including large ones, were supposed to be delivered to Mars using the superheavy Energy rocket. In the mid-1990s, samples of Martian soil were to be delivered to Earth.After that, together with the United States, a flight of people to Mars was to take place.

But this was mostly due to the centrally planned regime dragging the USSR though a period of crash industrialization.Coal, steel, wheat, butter. Factories, railways, tanks, guns, Rayon ties.It was a country where maximizing gross outputs were what mattered, in ever upward quantities. The problem was how all those raw materials should be arranged into products people actually wanted.A planned economy sounded good on paper: No longer would people be left vulnerable to the fickle vagaries of the free market. A planned economy could decide what needed to be produced, where, for the good of all. Sadly, no one had a clear idea of how this should work.

OGAS would have not only handed greater power to Gosplan itself, but also would have become a far too distributed entity than the Politburo were comfortable with.It also would have been hugely expensive. Cost estimates were said to be the equivalent of the H bomb project and Space program combined, if not more.20 billion rubles were initially proposed and it would have required 300,000 operators be trained to install and use it over 30 years. It was to be a long term super project to locomotive the USSR into the bright economic future.Lets not forget that the USSR defined itself by its competition with the USA,Glushkov’s meeting at the Kremlin in 1970 with the then General Secretary and Premier, Breshnev and Kosygin, to propose his plan, did not go well.It is said that the Ministry of Finance had had words in Kosygin's ear prior to the meeting.Upon Glushkovs arrival he found Brezhnev and Kosygin's seats at the table unoccupied.His two potential main supporters absent, the Project was not approved save for a hollowed out version that saw OGAS’s sophisticated command control system being used for switching the lights on and off in chicken hatcheries.The enormous body of work in cybernetics developed by Glushkov, and his predecessors, remained and he continued his endeavors somewhat embittered, away from the eyes of the Authorities.Today an interconnected, cybernetic world facilitates market relations and is a tool of capitalism, not socialism. But ironically it enables human beings to cooperate in far more socialistic ways than the Soviet Politburo, so-called vanguard of the workers, ever allowed.The USSR stumbled on, leaving its best ideas in the dust of its collapse….",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.9K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-stop-playing-video-games-with-my-child
17,"OGASMain point of implementing this system was toOGASMain point of implementing this system was to automate Gosplan calculations. Without it all calculations had to be done by hand. If something changes, all directives had to be recalculated. Also when general plan is calculated, it was lifted to ministries, branches and so on till concrete factory. Also it is important to mention that Soviet economy and Gosplan got more complex every year. And if something goes wrong and recalculations need to be done it could take weeks. ASPR allowed to calculate and recalculate all this on a fly. It’s power grew rapidly.

Real launch of OGAS was planned on 12th 5-years plan. SoPerestroika and Gorby ruined thoses plans putting project on hold.Yet, ASPR powers were used to calculate transition to market economy as it was capable to dynamically calculate parameters for any economy type. Few estimates have been done, all of them showed negative impact of transition to market economy. They exactly predicted inflation rate and many other parameters.

20,"USSR was better at:(See details below.)""Better at""USSR was better at:(See details below.)""Better at"" is a relative term and only can be stated in comparison to something else.   Because I have had experience living as a middle class person both in the USSR and in post-9/11 USA, I can compare what one was / is better at.  I do believe that post- 9/11 USA is different from pre-9/11, but that is a different story.I was born and lived in the Soviet Union for 15 years until it collapsed.We were a typical family with two kids, both parents were engineers. We lived in the capital of one of the Asian Republics.   My life experiences in the USSR, described below, are partially skewed because we lived in the capital (4+ million people) of the republic, the standards of living in the capital were much higher than in rural territories.Since the end of the USSR, I have lived in four countries, one of them is Russia, one of them is the USA.  Russia and the USSR are not the same thing, never confuse one for the other.  Russia was a significant part of the USSR, but only a part.  The USSR was much bigger, more diverse, more complex, and more complicated.  Two completely different countries, two completely different worlds.I am also now a parent to two children in the USA, and I can only wish they both had the experiences of my childhood.I have lived in the USA for almost as long as I lived in the USSR, if you discount the very first years of my childhood -- the years no one has memories of.Here is what the USSR was better at:1.   Certainty, continuityEveryone was an engineer (figuratively speaking).   There were also doctors and teachers, good doctors and good teachers; other than that, everyone was some kind of an engineer.There was certainty in everything.Everyone had the same path: you were born, and you stayed with your parent or grandparent until you were ~ 2-3 yo [mothers received paid maternity leaves for 4 months, and then half pay for 18 months], then you went to a public kindergarten 3-7 yo, then - to a public school 7-17 yo, then - to a public technical university or institute 17-22 yo, then, most of the time, you were required to go to some republic to work there (as an engineer in training) for 2-5 years, then you usually settled, started working as an engineer with some certain growth path, and had a family. Your children were born and the circle continued.I am certainly simplifying 'the circle of life' in the Soviet Union, but continuity and certainty were part of the system;  they were part of my childhood.Everyone wore the same uniform in schools, this helped us focus on grades, not on what classmates were wearing.  Almost the same uniform for 7-10 years, just two kinds -- one for the summer with short sleeves, and one for the winter with long sleeves, only the size changed as you grew up.In the USA, the current propaganda (ah, that word) is ""the only constant is change"", and ""embrace change.""    This post is not about the USA, so I won't go into why constant change and the possibility/threat of constant change, can be depressing for many, if not most individuals.2.  Free education at all levels from 3 to 22yo,Public kindergartens, schools, universities did not cost our parents anything out of pocket.  Yes, our parents both worked full time (for the country to afford paying for all of that free education) and did not spend much time with us, but so did everyone else's parents.  Because we didn't know anything different (such as the possibility of a stay at home parent for 18 years), what we had felt like a fine experience.The students studying for higher education (from 18 to 22 yo) received a monthly stipend from the government for five years.   This stipend was sufficient to live a frugal life and to focus on studying.Below are the pictures of the two typical school buildings built during the USSR time  (students from 7 to 17yo studied there).   They are both in the same neighborhood.    I graduated from one of these schools 20 years ago and went there for 10 years.   Most of the schools looked exactly the same.    These two pictures were taken in 2011 (20 years after the USSR collapsed) and the traffic signs on the walls are additions of the modern times.  During the USSR time, walls and colors were flat and not distracting (one can say not prompting creativity either.)I am not claiming authorship for these pictures, I found them online with no author identified.3.  Free sports3.  Free sportsAs a child, for no out-of-pocket cost to my parents, with no requirement for my parents to be present at practices, for extensive periods of time, I tried gymnastics, tennis, and basketball at world class facilities (I say so because those facilities produced athletes competing around the world), until I settled on basketball and enjoyed playing it for eight years, traveling all over a huge country.Not everyone was lucky enough to find a sport they loved, but (it is my belief) everyone had a chance to try many sports for free at no cost and no parental involvement except for a general awareness of where their child was.Twenty years after the fact, I realize, a team sport was the best thing that happened to me.I am certain if my parents had to pay for sports or had to be present at my practices, we would not have been able to afford it, and I would not have had the experiences and the strength basketball gave me.4. Free child care and early childhood developmentThe USSR needed both parents to work full time, so the whole system was set up to free parents from childcare after their children reached 18 months.    At kindergartens, children were taught to read by the age of 5-6 and to count.  By the age of 8 (kindergarten + 1 year of school), most kids knew the multiplication table.I believe this is where the USA loses the most.   In the USA, childcare is so expensive, so unorganized, and so dysfunctional, for such a rich country, it is almost a crime.  Early child education and development are paramount for raising capable adults.  If you lose the first 7 years by allowing them to be spent in an unstructured home environment with a mom or a dad cooking, cleaning, watching tv, dragging you to groceries stores, throwing you for care from one teen to another, whichever one is less expensive and available at the time, you can't catch up after 7.  The years of the most significant cognitive development are gone.  All the best world universities are powerless at that point.5.  Free health careFrom my experience, it was free and available.  When kids or adults got sick, doctors from the local medical centers came (usually walked) to your home, checked your heart rate, temperature, and helped decide what to do next.  For urgent cases, a free ambulance was available within 5-10 minutes.My mother had frequent migraines.  For many years, we called an ambulance usually at least once a month, sometimes more often, to help her with painkillers.  Had we had to pay each time (like I have to in the USA with a co-pay, IF I have insurance costing $10k/y for a family), we probably would have gone bankrupt or she would have died sooner.Since then, I have heard and read many other opinions -- that health care in the USSR was awful, with long wait times, with bribes defining if you got an operation or not.  This I believe became true after the end of the USSR.6.  SciencesThere was an emphasis on science and math in school.   By age 17, everyone had studied geometry, algebra, organic and non-organic chemistry, physics, anatomy, and biology. These all were mandatory.Twenty years after the fact, I am able to help my freshman niece with her chemistry and math at school.  I have not opened a chemistry book for 20 years, but I am still fluent with the Mendeleev periodic table.7.  Safety: pedophiles, gun and drug free neighborhoodsI walked from school by myself from the age of seven, so did everyone else in my neighborhood, and, I think, in my entire city of 4 million people, and in most of the country.I had not seen a single drug and did not know about what drugs were until the USSR ceased to exist.We lived in an average neighborhood, I went to an average school.   Not a single time did I heard about anyone killing anyone with a gun.   I am sure there were cases and they were kept secrets by some government body.  The fact is for fifteen years of my life I was not exposed to gun violence or drugs.On my basketball team, at any point in time, we had 30 to 40 girls from 7 to 15yo, we traveled for championships to other cities and other Republics for at least one week out of every month, and for three months every summer (this was not typical for everyone, but this was part of my life), none of the ~ 70 girls (with rotation over time) I believe ever was exposed to an unwanted sexual experience, drugs, or guns.   Our summer basketball camps gathered probably 500+ kids.  Not a single time did I heard about anything wrong.   We did not have bodyguards, police with guns, or any other type of enforcement agency personnel in my 8 years of travel.Alcoholism was a huge problem, but the incidents were isolated to each individual family, and each family struggled on its own, and alcoholic (usually) fathers were usually hurting mostly just their own families.8.  Walking and affordable public transportation95% of the population did not have cars.  If your family had a car, you were considered rich and ""out of norm"".The neighborhoods were built for walking. Withing walking distance, in every neighborhood, there was a kindergarten, a school, two to three grocery stores (and/or an open market), sport facilities, and engineering jobs your parents walked to.Our city had a gazillion buses, trolleys, and trams, and a metro.   You could get to any part of the city within 20-60 minutes by affordable public transportation.  The Metro was a sure way, buses and trams came every 10-15 min.   It was not perfect, but it was there, and it worked.   My family never had a car. My parents were fit for all their lives because they walked to and from their job.Pictures of the metro stations built under the USSR:9.  Recycling, reusing, fixingOnly after I noticed that my small family in the USA throws a huge plastic bag of garbage every Day and after I heard about global warming so many times, and after remembering that my dad during my childhood used to take out a small bucket of garbage every couple of days, I went back in my memories and realized that in the USSR:- Stores did not offer plastic bags or any other kind of free bags.Because we were fairly poor (living from paycheck to paycheck), paying for a plastic bag was not affordable, so we carried reusable bags with us all the time.As far as I am concerned, whatever the reason stores did not offer plastic bags (such as lack of a customer service concept), the result was that the bags were not piling up in a garbage can after every trip for groceries (or my parents were not faced with the task of keeping plastic bags to later dispose of at a local grocery store).- There were no plastic bottles.All juices, lemonades, seltzer, milk, and kefir were sold in glass bottles.  When you brought the glass bottles back to the store for reusing (aka recycling), the stores paid a tangible amount per bottle.  Our family always took the glass bottles back, not because we were so responsible, but because bringing them back and getting paid was tangible for our pockets.- Wastepaper was accepted for recycling and paid for by weight.There were sort of kiosks where they accepted wastepaper and paid money for it.  One time, my mother managed to take 10 kilograms (20+ pounds) of our childrens books and turn them in as wastepaper for some money.  My dad and I (my brother was old by then) could never understand why she did that, but we loved her, so we got over the loss of our books.There were organized competitions to turn in wastepaper.  Pioneers and komsomols  (scouts) were motivated to turn in wastepaper and were given some (nonsense, but honorable at the time) rewards/titles, like ""the best pioneer"" or something like that, for the most wastepaper turned in.- Scrap metal was accepted for recycling.There were organized competitions to turn in scrap metal.   Again, there were rewards for bringing more than others did.- Fixing things instead of buying new ones.We lived paycheck to paycheck; loans, generally, were not an option (except for rare occasions), buying new stuff was not an option. We fixed all appliances that broke.  We had the same iron for years and the same barely working washing machine.Buying a new smartphone every six months (while talking about global warming) would probably have been considered a crime.In retrospect, I realize and recognize all of that free stuff became utopian, but at the time, for as long as it lasted, it was what the USSR was better at.10.  FrugalityThe USSR was great at creating a frugal, yet inspired, middle class.  My parents supplemented incomes from their engineering jobs with 'low level' jobs (my mom cleaned a local college and my dad loaded heavy boxes in the evenings) and yet we were counting every ""kopieka""=penny.   We lived within our means because there were no credit cards or loans.   One of my most unbelievable memories is that when I was 7,  when I had one pair of shoes for all occasions (we lived in a hot climate), we were excited when we could buy another pair for me just for sports.  [I won't mention how many pairs of shoes each of my children and I have now.  :) ]It was a livable frugality. We had meaningful lives.  We were inspired by big things -- by getting to the Moon, by science, by all the ambitious long term plans the government announced and the country as a whole often achieved (often, by inspiring & making people work extra time in fields and at factories for no or little pay.)Continuity gave a feeling of stability and there was never a question ""How am I going to pay my bills tomorrow (if I lose my job or just because I amassed bills beyond my means)???""  Parents never lost jobs, we never had bills we could not afford.  My parents were not the best savers and not the best budgeters, but we had all we needed at the very minimum, so did my friends and my peers.Update 1:  On purpose, I did not go in to the police state and the lack of  freedoms.   The question was not about what USSR was worse at.  :)Update 2: One's experiences of what the USSR was better at was different during Stalin's era from the pre Gorbachev era and from Gorbachev's era.   In the outside world, people believe KGB was all over the place all the time.   This was not the case or at less the case during the last 15-20 years of the USSR's existence. My generation (born in 1974-1980), I believe, grew up with no fear of the KGB, and hardly with any fears at all.Update 3: All of the above, except for affordable public transportation disappeared within a year after the USSR ceased to exist.   Everything got destroyed so fast, it was hard to believe it ever existed.   Free got exchanged for bribery, safety was exchanged for an endless flow of drugs from Afganistan and the former USSR republics.  Killing became a profession in Russin.   But, at that point, it was not the USSR any longer.   Every Republic became its own country with its own currency, and started doing its own thing.  From that point on, one can write fifteen stories of what each one of them was better at (or worse at).The very first years after the end of the USSR were very educational.   It is fascinating to live during hyperinflation.  I also learned what a cross-rate (in foreign exchange operations) is not from the books but by experience.   We had local money (called Soums), exchanged them for rubles, dollars, tenge (another currency of a neighboring republic) and at 18, in my head, I could calculate with which currency or in which country it was less expensive to buy a certain item (the base was either soums or dollars).

The common people mostly don't like drastic changes unless their lives have become intolerable. The common people would most likely be concerned about ""how will my job be affected?"" ""What's going to happen to my children's kindergarten?"" ""how will my pension be affected?"" etc. There were no answers to any of these day-to-day questions.So what happened? The people were told ""You f*cking brainwashed idots! You don't know what's good for you!"" The Russians, or the Russian elite, i.e., Yeltsin, wanted out. Economically, Russia had contributed more to the other republics than getting money back from the other republics, in exchange for the political influence in other countries. As money got tight, Russia wanted to drop the burden. Nobody, least of all, the ""leader of democracy"", gave a sh*t about ""the will of the people"".OnThe story was that Yeltsin got so drunk, that Shushkevich had to grab him by his arm when he almost fell down from the stairs. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan didn't hear about it until 3 days later. He bawled his eyes out, packed up, went home, and declared independence 8 days later, onSo what happened after the Dissolution?The Baltic countries definitely made the economically correct move. All three of them now have higher GDP per capita than Russia.The 5 -stans, without Russian injection of cash and technology, mostly did not fare so well, except Kazakhstan. Ironically, the republic which most abhor leaving USSR now have a GDP per capita close to Russia, thanks to the oil and gas exploration.The original instigators, i.e., Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, all fared relatively poorly. All of them took at least 10 years to get back to where they were before, while the rest of the world has moved on... Ukraine in particular, 25 years later, is still below their 1990 level.Here is the GDP per capita normalized to 1991 level for all former USSR republics. As you can see, almost half of them are still not getting back to their pre-1991 level. Source:So you see, the people were, actually, more correct than the politicians. They knew that the Baltic countries would be better off, the Central Asian countries would very likely to be worse off, and the three Slavic countries, i.e., Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, would more likely sink than swim. But there was nothing they could do about it. That's that.

Not the kind of person you need to explain ropes of a new technology.Soviet scientists offered to change the currents of the rivers in Siberia from north to south to ameliorate southern steppes and to drill a hole through the Earth to the antipodes, among other things, and also banned the science of genetics.American historian Simon Ings wrote, “Soviet science was at once the glory and the laughingstock of the intellectual world.”The Arctic in particular received a lot of attention from radical Soviet scientists who believed that there lay the key to man-made climate change (they erred on timeline and the method).Elon Musk would approve of this proposed bridge across the Bering Strait with two levels of rail tracks for super-fast trains to connect nowhere with nowhere.Block the Bering Strait that connects Alaska with Siberia with a dam to stop the discharge of warm waters from the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic, and bring English weather to the eastern coast of Chukotka. The length of the Bering Strait is 86 kilometers. For the purpose, cyclopean pumps would be built to pump water using nuclear energy through the dam.Soviet architect Kazimir Luchesky drew a plan for Beringov, a unique, one-of-a-kind Transcontinental Highway City. A cozy place with low-rises arranged in steps, to be visible from afar. He envisioned travelators - moving sidewalks, and electric cars.Evgeny Pastors, an enthusiast from Latvia, proposed sending 25 ships with “suitable power” to the Arctic to push all the ice into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, where it would melt. To speed up the process, Pastors came up with the idea of attaching sails made of tarpaulin to the ice floes to move them south with the fair wind.After the end of Great Patriotic War, Engineer Savinov suggested detonating a few dozen nukes across the Arctic Ocean to clear an ice-free passage for year round navigation.Soviet climate scientist Mikhail Budyko proposed to destroy the Arctic ice with soot, which should have strengthened absorbing properties. The ice would melt faster from solar heat and radiation. According to Budyko’s calculations the process would be irreversible.Additionally, special algae would be grown on a monomolecular film so that the water does not cool during evaporation.Dreamers push boundaries and eventually change the world.

My nostalgia and mourning for this fascinating, all–powerful andI so fondly remember reading beautifully illustrated children’s books in impeccable English, with the title page readingI consider the Soviet famine of 1932–33What went wrong? Why did the Soviet Union never get a Deng Xiaoping figure who could develop and enhance the nation’s founding ideology to help it operate in changing conditions, and solve new problems? This is too complicated for me to answer, but it is a big part of why the USSR stagnated by the end of the 1960s. Yet the truth is also that when Gorbachev took power in 1985, the Union was in okay shape. Its institutions were functioning, its people lived reasonably well, its military expenditure (while intentionally driven up to intense levels by the scumbag United States) was not perilously high, its economic growth wasn’t great but it was good, its political system and military were more than capable of quelling secessionism and keeping the constituent republics together (a necessary ability forAnyway, this is beyond me, as I said. I still have much to learn.I can never express sufficient gratitude to the Soviet Union for all the financial, political, and military help it gave to independence movements all over Africa and Asia and for standing resolutely with countries bullied by the infernal United States. Decolonization would never have been possible without the USSR.

As you might know Mongolian society is predominantly nomadic, so creating a system that was able to reach the farthest nomads was significant.EducationMongolia enjoyed literacy rate of 95 percent. Basically the whole population became literate. Comparatively, very few mongols could read and write before 1921. As I mentioned before, creating an education system where most of the people are nomads is not easy.AgricultureAnimal husbandry was the most affected. From personal property, the livestock became government property. Very effective system of animal control (numbers were controlled within 20 mil) with effective veterinary service was established. In 2017, Mongolia now doesn't have a veterinary system anymore. This affects the health of the livestock. also the number of livestock reached 50 mil, contributing to desertification.Growing wheat, vegetables was something new to Mongols. It was predominantly done by Chinese, Uzbeks and other minorities. We reached a lot of success in this sector. Just to give you an example, production of potato, second most important crop, reached the communist times, only in 2004, almost 20 years later. same with wheat production.Ulaanbaatar city, capitalThe city became unrecognizable.

Not used an Infinity Stone, but got their powers from an Infinity Stone.Ultron and VisionTony Stark and Bruce Banner initially thought that the Mind Stone was just a fancy AI and created Ultron to do fairly basic computing. In fact, the only reason he even needed the Mind Stone was the scale on which he wanted to operate and the fairly vague operational parameters he wanted to give it. “Protect the world” is not really the clearest directive someone could give a computer. Ultron never really accessed the Mind Stone’s abilities beyond cobbling together enough code to be a sentient computer program.Vision was built by Ultron to be his best possible body, using the best possible parts. And the Mind Stone did exactly for Vision what it did for Ultron: it allowed him to cobble together the code to become a sentient computer program, albeit one operating at an even higher level than Ultron. None of the Vision’s abilities even seemed to be derived from the Mind Stone, they just seemed to be things Ultron put into his body (with the exception of the energy beams and phasing).In both cases, The Vision and Ultron seemed to be limited by their own lack of imagination. They treated the Mind Stone as a basic computer processor, which is something they got directly from Tony Stark and Bruce Banner who thought the same thing.QuicksilverQuicksilver and Scarlet Witch were created by someone with no clue what he was doing. Baron Strucker didn’t even remove the Mind Stone from its protective coating. We don’t know exactly what experiments he was attempting, but we know they were miserable failures that resulted in only two people gaining powers, with the rest dying.Quicksilver’s powers are, as stated by Maria Hill, “increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.” Now if I had to guess how he got those powers from the Mind Stone it would be that his nervous system is incredibly sped up coupled with enhanced perception, resulting in all-around super speed. It’s an effective power, but kind of outside the Mind Stone’s wheelhouse.Scarlet WitchScarlet Witch’s powers, again as stated by Maria Hill, are “neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.” She is a telepath/telekinetic. This is very, very much in the Mind Stone’s wheelhouse. This is why the Scarlet Witch is so formidable. She is utilizing the power of the Mind Stone exactly how it is intended to be used. This is why she was able to smash her way through Ultron's drones left and right. It’s why her powers seem to fluctuate with her emotions.While Vision and Ultron were using the Mind Stone just as a fancy computer and Quicksilver was using the power in an odd way, Scarlet Witch is what the power is actually capable of, even when several steps removed from the Stone itself way.Captain MarvelMar-Vell was, as explicitly stated in the text of the movie, attempting to build an engine to take a reasonably large group of refugees to an entirely different galaxy at light speed. And while it exploded, and she died, all indications are that the engine was successful. Carol Danvers was hit by the massive energy that was fueling that particular engine, all of which was derived from the Space Stone.And Mar-Vell was basing her engine design on highly advanced Kree science, and unlike Strucker, Bruce, or Tony, she actually knew what she was doing. So let’s just say that her engine was using a hell of a lot of energy.Carol, much like Wanda, is using the energy of the Space Stone exactly how it was intended. In fact, it is exactly how one would likely use it if one were traveling to a different galaxy. She is using it for speed, for energy generation and projection, and for the durability to survive high-speed impacts as well as many different levels of gravity.ConclusionCaptain Marvel is using the Space Stone’s energy in a particularly impressive way, seemingly due to the peculiar circumstances under which she was exposed to it. Vision, on the other hand, was using the Mind Stone in a much more limited way, due to no one involved in his creation having a particularly good idea of what it even was, let alone is capable of.","3,450 followers",Olisa Efobi,5.1K,838,25.3M,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-stop-playing-video-games-with-my-child
