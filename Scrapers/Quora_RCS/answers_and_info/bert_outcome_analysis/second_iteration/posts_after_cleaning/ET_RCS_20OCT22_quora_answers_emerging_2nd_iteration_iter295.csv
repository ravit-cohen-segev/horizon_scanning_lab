1,"The primary problem with the Polywell design and other similar designs, which essentially use external fields to bring particle beams to focus, is that the theory which shows that they work ignores collective effects. Ignoring collective effects amounts to ignoring all of the important potential instabilities.What I mean by collective effect is the effect of the electric and magnetic fields of the particle beams on the beams themselves. If one assumes that the particles can just follow the externally created fields one throws away all of the interesting and important dynamics.

If one assumes that the particles can just follow the externally created fields one throws away all of the interesting and important dynamics. Some work has been done recently to clear up the theoretical picture, and I will provide references soon and more details when I get the chance.I think the reason that one sees things like the Polywell appear on kickstarter, and the reason that it has a large internet following is due to the impression that it has been ignored by the plasma physics and fusion community, and also due to the fact that seemingly promising ideas for power generation get a strong following from laypeople.",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777.1K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-merits-and-drawbacks-of-the-Polywell-fusion-reactor-design
2,"Mostly because its fun in the story.Certainly none of the current fusion reactors we are designing could be overloaded in this manner - in all our current fusion reactor designs, if anything goes wrong you’d almost instantly lose containment, which would cause the pressure and temperature to drop dramatically, thus ceasing fusion altogether. The containment failure would quite possibly damage the interior of the reactor, making it impossible to restart without extensive repairs - but by no means should it give off more energy than the reactor would while running under normal conditions.That’sMostly because its fun in the story.Certainly none of the current fusion reactors we are designing could be overloaded in this manner - in all our current fusion reactor designs, if anything goes wrong you’d almost instantly lose containment, which would cause the pressure and temperature to drop dramatically, thus ceasing fusion altogether. The containment failure would quite possibly damage the interior of the reactor, making it impossible to restart without extensive repairs - but by no means should it give off more energy than the reactor would while running under normal conditions.That’s not to say that building a fusion reactor that WAS designed to overload and produce a large fusion explosion is impossible, but it sounds difficult to say the least, and there’s certainly no reason to imagine that most craft - even military ones - would be designed in such a way. It would be much simpler to just detonate any of the actual fusion warheads on board if you want to instantly and thoroughly scuttle your ship.So we have to imagine that something about the fundamental design of the reactors in The Expanse - which in the show are depicted as some kind of laser-confinement reactors - lends them to suffer this kind of overload by simply tweaking their operation parameters. Again, not something any of our current designs could or would accomplish.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-merits-and-drawbacks-of-the-Polywell-fusion-reactor-design

It was eventually discovered that nuclear fusion powers stars.In 1920 British physicist Francis William Aston discovered that the mass equivalent of four hydrogen atoms is heavier than the mass of one helium atom (2He4), which implied that net energy can be released by combining hydrogen atoms to form helium. This provided the first hints of a mechanism by which stars could produce energy. Throughout the 1920s, Arthur Stanley Eddington became a major proponent of the proton–proton chain reaction (PP reaction) as the primary system running the Sun.[1][2] Quantum tunneling was discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1929, and shortly afterwards Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei.Rutherford understood what tremendous forces could be unleashed from the atom nucleus. In a famous 1934 experiment that opened the way to present-day fusion research (including ITER), he realized the fusion of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) into helium, observing that ""an enormous effect was produced.""The first patent related to a fusion reactor was registered in 1946 by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. The inventors were Sir George Paget Thomson and Moses Blackman.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-merits-and-drawbacks-of-the-Polywell-fusion-reactor-design

Unfortunately irregularities in the plasma and thermal losses have prevented a continuous sustained reaction.In inertial confinement a tiny container of cryogenic hydrogen fuel is ablated and heated by a powerful laser array in a fashion analogous to a tiny hydrogen bomb. The repeated fusion of a steady stream of these tiny pellets would create a controlled sustained flow of energy.Ironically one of the features of fusion reactions that helps make thermonuclear bombs practical is a potential barrier to practical fusion power generation.The highly energetic neutrons emitted from fusion can destroy the structural integrity of reactor materials and even render them temporarily radioactive.Since controlled fusion systems have so far failed to operate for prolonged periods they haven't yet had to face this problem.A second issue with intense neutron flux is that it can be used to generate plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons production.Such issues mean that fusion power may not prove to be the “clean, endless” source of electricity that some proponents believe.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Hollywood is under no obligation to present actual science in their “entertainment”. In fact they often create scenarios which are contrary to KNOWN scientific reality. Hollywood is guilty of horrific science dis-education (and many other sorts of dis-education too).OK, enough of that. On to reality.Any real fusion reactor is going to have to somehow bring small nuclei like deuterium or tritium close enough together so that the strong nuclear force will take hold and fuse those nuclei and release energy. The problem is that the strong force has limited range whereas the electric force has unlimited range and is quite strong itself, and it always pushes nuclei away from each other.In order to bring those nuclei close enough to overcome the electric force the nuclei have to be moving really, really fast. There are two ways to do that (that I am aware of).One way isInertial confinement does not yet work so well (or ever?) in the less destructive machines we have built such as theThe second way to whack small nuclei together hard enough and often enough to extract useful energy from their fusion is to make make them move fast enough by confining them in a “magnetic bottle” and heating them with radio waves. (A matter bottle would cool them instantly so they could not fuse.) Scientist are still actively pursuing this too, but gas that hot, a plasma, does not want to be confined and it has STRONG tendency to want to escape.And now we come to the answer to the original question.The machines we build to try to bring small nuclei together require aMaybe it will work someday, but don’t hold your breath waiting for it.

If they ever do make fusion work the fusion reactor will only be using tiny amounts of fuel at any one time, too little to explode in any big way.",339 followers,Alex Robinson,3.1K,825,21.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-merits-and-drawbacks-of-the-Polywell-fusion-reactor-design
