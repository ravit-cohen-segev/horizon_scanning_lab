0,Hydrogen fusion making helium as a byproduct will not make helium significantly less scarce. Because the amount of hydrogen required to make lots of energy is pretty darn small. So the byproduct will also be small.,"29,752 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,2.7K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce
1,"We could sustainably provide the the Helium that the world currently uses and simultaneously provide a level of worldwide power generation permitting freedom from poverty that typically accompanies lack of access to energy by building 202,000 one Gigawatt D-D fusion reactors worldwide.The world currently consumes (2018) about1.7 x 10^8 m^3 of HeliumWe could sustainably provide the the Helium that the world currently uses and simultaneously provide a level of worldwide power generation permitting freedom from poverty that typically accompanies lack of access to energy by building 202,000 one Gigawatt D-D fusion reactors worldwide.The world currently consumes (2018) about1.7 x 10^8 m^3 of HeliumGenerating worldwide 202 Terawatts of energy from D-D fusion would provide a future population of 10 billion people planet wide with a per capita fusion energy allotment of 20.2 kilowatts. After considering losses due to fusion to electrical power conversion and losses resulting from power distribution then the power produced by 202,700 one Gigawatt D-D fusion reactors would permit sustainable consumption (11 kW per capita) of power for a future worldwide population of 10 billion people.Note: Eleven kW per capita is about the level of power use from all energy sources currently enjoyed by people living in the United States.Why use D-D fusion to power the world?The ultimate potential of D-D Fusion is very great.Fusion Energy longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium. The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-years of energy. In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).There is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between Magnetic Confinement Fusion and Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain. The actual relationship between plasma density and the fusion energy that can be drawn from fusion plasma burning at fusion conditions is not linear but isThe graph below shows the typical plasma density used in current fusion experiments.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments can, however, operate at higher temperatures and much higher, by a factor of 10^10, plasma pressure than Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments like tokamaks (ITER) or stellarators (W7-x). For ICF fusion, D-D fusion of pure deuterium is a practical fusion reaction and will in the future be used for reliable sustained worldwide fusion power generation.D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on","74,682 followers",Tiny Nair,547,689,27.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

Translated into horsepower, the nuclear aircraft was expected to produce about 400 thousand horse power (300 Megawatts).(300 megawatt = 402 306.6 horsepower)(more information on aircraft nuclear reactors)Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear aircraft propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over any currently proposed nuclear fission based approach -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for aircraft nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield and harvest for driving electrically driven propellers. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on light weight grids suffices).Will there ever be nuclear powered aircraft?Perhaps so (and perhaps sooner than you think).Mankind is currently in possession of a practical fusion technology (fission-fusion) that produces more energy from fusion than it takes to initiate and maintain for a few nanoseconds the fusion reaction.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion isMankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test of 1952 that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion while using nuclear fission to reliably bring Deuterium fusion plasma to fusion conditions.A minimum size fission burst (or alternatively a laser irradiating a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere which implodes initiating D-T fusion) which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a pressurized liquid deuterium-filled tube.A suitable Nuclear Aircraft design -Boeing’s Blaine Rawdon, a Senior Aircraft designer, designed an outstanding large aircraft that would be well suited to aneutronic Inertial Confinement fusion propulsion.

The aircraft is planned to be powered by eight 80,000-horsepower turbine engines driving four counter-rotating propellers, each of which is as tall as a five-story building.

It should be perhaps compared side by side in detail:CostCost of nuclear fuel is negligible both for fusion and fission, in both cases the main part of electricity cost would be amortization of initial investment to build the machine.Fusion technology (superconductor, vacuum vessels, cryogenic cooling, plasma tech …) is much more technologically advanced, and almost certainly much more costly (per Mega Watt) than fission tech. In contrast fission power is very simple - you just put nearly-critical mass of nuclear fuel to water boiler, and it “burns” by itself (it is almost miracle how easy it is in principle).On the other hand, fission power plant are becoming more and more costly due to added safety features (e.g. huge confinement building around etc.). Since fusion is inherently more safe (there is less stored energy for explosion and much less of radioactive material for leak) it does not require invest so much into added safety. Still I don’t think it will pay off the hugely costly hi-tech. Also new generation fission reactors (Unfavourable property of (fission) nuclear power plant is their size. Large powerplant is cheaper (per Mega Watt). This is even much more true for Tokamak based fusion power plant due to scalling law of magnetic confinement, only multi-Giga-watt reactor can achieve net energy gain (inertial confinement may be different). In this respect it is much more realistic to build small fission reactors than fusion reactors.Radiation safetyFusion reactor produce huge amount of energetic neutrons (while fission neutrons has energy ~2MeV, fusion neutron ~15MeV). These neutrons are hard to shield and cause serious radiation damage to materials.The main advantage of fusion reactor is that the amount of radioactive material stored inside (<1kg plasma) is much lower than in fission reactor (>100ton - including moderator and coolant) which makes huge difference in case of accident. Nevertheless, the mass of irradiated reactor components is comparable. Also if tritium is produced by irradiation of lithium cooling blanket, the volume of radioactive material will be comparable.The other huge advantage is that nuclear fusion istelf (unlike fission) does not produce broad variety of long-live radioactive reaction products (like radioctive iodine, stroncium, or trans-uran actinoides). But very radioctive products can be formed by irradiation of the surrounding structural material by the neutrons. This can be to large degree managed by choice of the materials, although this choice may be limited since the material mus at the same time fullfill other requrements (thermal shielding, strenght, conductivity…).Nuclear ProliferationSince fusion reactor is great neutron source, it can be used to breed various nuclear materials including plutonium-239. But since breeding is based on neutron capture which require slow neutrons (fast neutron cause fission instead), fission reactors with slow neutron spectrum are more suitable for this purpose.Space applicationDespite fission nuclear energy seems to be favourable for common energy generation on Earth, in space it is different story. In space you have plenty of vacuum, cryogenic cooling, but you are limited by mass. Therefore you may prefer to create huge (but light) open magnetic chamber open to ambient vacuum with radiative cooling, rather than 1000ton steel boiler filled with water.The only method how to achieve high specific impulse and high thrust at the same time, is pulsed nuclear power (since it is impossible to continuously confine and cool respective power density). Fusion pulsed power can be miniaturized better than fission pulsed power, since you are not limited by critical mass and low neutron crossection.Also in space Deuterium, Tritium and He-3 is easier to harvest than uranium and thorium.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

Cheap power that needs no backing store and can be located anywhere changes the equation.Compact fusion generators of the sort Lockheed Martin is working on, if they prove successful, can lead to a highly decentralized power grid, making for a more robust and reliable power infrastructure with fewer potential single points of failure.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","29,752 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce

That currently practical fusion technology is called fission-fusion, where nuclear fission is used to reliably produce the conditions for fusion.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are designs for smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion isThe energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium and neutrons).Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over gas and diesel cars -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for fusion car applications and deserve close attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be fusion cars?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary. ICF fusion power plants will probably be smaller than MCF fusion and may ultimately be of a size that could be installed in certain transportation vehicles (ships, trains, planes, trucks, and ultimately cars). What will probably be the most practical way to fusion powered vehicles (of a sort) for perhaps the next fifty years is to use stationary fusion power plants to produce electricity and then to use nuclear fusion produced electricity to charge conventional electric vehicles with storage batteries.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion ----------","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-develop-controlled-nuclear-fusion-someday-will-helium-no-longer-be-scarce
