1,"Sure, if you need it every now and then and it is your only source to connect to internet, yes you can. This will not harm the router if that's the concern but I will suggest not to keep it on at all times because it emmits radiation which is harmful. So use it only when you need to do heavy downloading or browsing high quality videos.",2 followers,Buster Smith,866,11.7K,82.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-malware-attacks-in-2016

Do not let children use the computer with administrator privileges since they tend to download viruses.5. Have a good firewall running and real-time windows protection running, plus run a virus check regularly.",62 followers,Garima Jain,10K,183,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-malware-attacks-in-2016

I’m not surprised that the product innovators who grew up on “Internet Time” are impatient with the rate of progress, but I think that the rate is actually quite good.The lifetime of things like houses is long - typically fifty to a hundred years or more. They are viewed as capital investments and as a result have payback periods that are quite long. This means that the rate of change of infrastructure in them will be slow. Moreover, these systems (and they are systems) are quite sensitive to investment cost and operating cost.The public and the builders recognized that installing ethernet wiring in houses was simply impractical for older buildings because of the cost and the disruption, so they simply waited for a better solution. That solution came along in the form of 802.11, marketed under the name WiFi. Over the last decade the WiFi equipment has improved in functionality, performance, cost effectiveness, and reliability. There is no longer any reason to consider wiring your house with ethernet or even coax cable except for the places where you plan to install your WiFi access points. Problem solved for the installed base of houses, as well as for the future.The purveyors of smart home technology have three different barriers to adoption:1. Capital investment and redevelopment cycle for housing.*1. What problem are they solving?*","66,018 followers",Niklas Göke,20.7K,235,32.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-okay-to-keep-a-router-on-all-the-time

Your writing will be better forever.Refuse to use the word “thing.”Each thing can be described in more detail. When we don’t we’re just being lazy.

Your writing will be better forever.Refuse to use the word “thing.”Each thing can be described in more detail. When we don’t we’re just being lazy. Don’t drown the cake in frosting to avoid baking a new one.Let a device be a device, a trait be a trait, a feeling be a feeling.Before: “This is the greatest thing my parents taught me.”After: “This is the greatest lesson my parents taught me.”No brackets.Like “thing,” parentheses only weaken what you actually want to say. If you want to say it, say it. If not, don’t.Whether it’s the brackets that are unnecessary or what’s in them is for you to decide. But one of the two is. At least 99% of the time.Probability is on your side when you ditch them.Before: “You must pass a (ridiculously hard) course.”After: “You must pass a ridiculously hard course.”Fewer prepositions.Many of us need to free up time these days. But time doesn’t go anywhere on its own. Not up. Not down. You don’t have to pull it. You take it. Or make it.Don’t free up time. Make time. Don’t move out. Just move. You won’t miss out on the concert. You’ll miss it.Sometimes we even add two unnecessary prepositions to one verb.Before: “He wants to meet up with Sarah in the morning.”After: “He wants to meet Sarah in the morning.”Eliminate redundant references.The reader arrived from your last sentence. She’ll remember it. Don’t begin the next one with a preposition or injection.“So” doesn’t say so much, “as before” breaks...",0 followers,Cathy Steyn,587,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-to-prevent-my-smart-home-from-hackers
