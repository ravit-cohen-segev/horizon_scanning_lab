So loading a website takes AT LEAST 6 minutes.But when Earth and Mars are at their furthest, there is a 22 minute one-way radio trip…and a 44 minute round-trip.It’s actually even worse than that - when Earth and Mars are in opposition - the Sun is between the two and you can’t transmit any direct messages between them at all. Instead, there would have to be a satellite somewhere off to the side - which would increase the delay to an hour or more.Even if you’re really patient, most networks drop the connection if a reply doesn’t appear in a minute or so.All of this means that there is essentially no way to access the Earth Internet from Mars unless you’re prepared to spend weeks trying to get what you need.Most likely, Mars would have it’s own Internet - and the more important web sites would be copied to Mars when changes are made. But smaller, more obscure sites aren’t going to be able to do that - so the vast numbers of fascinating quirky places just won’t be reachable unless you plan days in advance.So you’d have fast access to (say) Wikipedia - but the pages you’d be able to read would be a day, a week, a month out of date.BANDWIDTH:These long delays are one problem - but another is overall bandwidth. If there are only a handful of people on Mars - then sending emails, texts and tweets back to Earth wouldn’t be a problem…but once you have thousands of people doing that - the radio link between Mars and Earth would soon become choked by the volume of data.At that point - you may be sharply limited in what you can send back to Earth.300 million miles is no easy gap to cross.MARS-NET:If SpaceX continues to play a major part in the colony - then it’s likely that they’d put StarLink satellites into Mars orbit - which could provide a GPS-like navigation service and fast Internet access over the entire planet.For talking to other people on Mars - accessing web sites on Mars - then there is really no reason why it shouldn’t be as fast as here on Earth.For large bulk data - it may be that we ship things like movies, TV shows and such with the resupply ships that’ll show up every 2.2 years. So a burst of new stuff arrives.CONCLUSION:Ultimately - it’s going to be tough for the culture of Earth and Mars to stay together. Sooner or later, there will be different memes on Mars - new social media - new web sites - that will scarcely interact with Earth web sites.When you can only talk easily with fellow Martians - they’ll be your friends - and you’ll stop needing to talk to Earth.Mars will start to use words differently - give it 100 years and who knows how wide the gulf will become.",146 followers,Nick Tresidder,2.1K,601,414.9K,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-will-the-Internet-be-on-Mars

The latency for an Earth-Mars internet connection varies according Distance between the planets, which in turn depends on where the planets are in their orbits. This is in is in the previously mentioned 15-45 minute range.So, if you are sending the Great Martian Novel to your publisher on Earth, whoosh! it's sent in a second, takes a while (15-45 minutes) to get to Earth, and is received in a second. An indication that the data was successfully received is sent, which arrives after a while and indicates that the temporary copy of the data won't be needed for retransmission.On the other hand, trying to do a video chat with your snugums back on Earth will be awful. It will be 4K resolution, at a minimum, but you will have to wait at least half an hour and up to an hour and a half from saying, ""I love you"", until you know whether she/he responds in the way you hope. The same kind of delay will apply if you try to view a Web page on Earth. The result is that it isn't slow, but it will sure feel like it is.So, the connection will be fast and that will be enough for some purposes, but woefully inadequate for others.[I actually described a simple minded send data/wait for acknowledgement/retransmit if request approach. Actually, it work work like that. All data will be send with extra bits to make it likely that it can be reconstructed even if hit by a burst of static. There are then two kinds of data: those that it's okay to lose some of occasionally, like video feeds, and those where no loss is acceptable, like the high resolution image of the first Martian life form. If a chunk of the first type of data is smashed, you just toss it. It is the second type of data where you need an acknowledgement from the receiver saying that the data was successfully received or that it must be resent. There are lots of games that can be played, but ultimately you can't make the latency go away]",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,5.3K,12.9K,66.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-will-the-Internet-be-on-Mars

I never felt unloved or that I didn’t belong. I had your typical drama involved in being a kid and growing up, but my parents are my parents. They stepped in when my biological parents couldn’t.However, there are two sides to every story, no?Five years ago, my parents were getting ready to move back to the US from our home country. I planned a visit to see them and other family before the big move. It was on that trip that I met my biological mother. My adoptive parents (mom) had done all the footwork locating her for me. We picked her up at a train station - the instant recognition/bond was…I don’t even know how to explain it. We knew who the other was without even saying a word. Didn’t even need a “hello”.I learned that she was in college when she found out she was five months pregnant with me, a product of a short relationship she was in. She never informed my father. Her father (my grandfather) told her she couldn’t keep me and sent her away to live in another city with my aunt until she was ready to give birth. No one ever knew about me except her family.I always wanted siblings and I was anxious to see if I had any. She ended up marrying a man who had 2 children from a previous relationship. Giving me up had been too painful so she decided to raise his kids rather than have any more of her own. At first I felt special knowing that I was her one and only. Her husband never knew about me (since I was born many years before they met) and she didn’t know how to bring it up with him after all these years. No big deal. My intention of meeting her was not to disrupt her life and cause unnecessary drama. However, as time has passed, I sometimes get jealous of the kids, especially her son, who got to grow up with her as a mom. A little part of me stings from the “rejection” from my biological mom for things that were out of her control. It’s not something I hold against her. It’s not her fault.

11,"Yes - it is basically impossible.But the problem isn’t with the state of our physics knowledge - it’s a matter of computational complexity and lack of perfect input data for a fundamentally “chaotic” system.The first difficultyYes - it is basically impossible.But the problem isn’t with the state of our physics knowledge - it’s a matter of computational complexity and lack of perfect input data for a fundamentally “chaotic” system.The first difficultyCollecting all of that data with sufficient accuracy to solve the problem will be very difficult - and because problems involving turbulent airflows and flexible materials are mathematically “chaotic” - there is extreme sensitivity to those initial conditions, and small errors in your input data will rapidly blow up into larger and larger errors in the results as the simulation proceeds.The second difficultyBut don’t go away with the idea that this is a flaw in physics - it’s really not. We fully understand how paper flexes and how air molecules flow and interact. The physics is quite well understood.The problem is essentially the same as weather forecasting. We don’t have perfect information about the airflow right now - and the further in time we predict ahead, the more any small error in our information will throw the prediction off-track.The well known “Butterfly Effect” applies here. The moment when you released the sheet of paper from your hand, your heart beat - the small additional flow of blood through your forearm caused a small ripple along your skin as that blood pulsed through your wrist. This started a tiny pressure wave that propagated upwards to the underside of the sheet of paper - giving it a very slight upward curve - which in turn changed the pressure of the air above that point - starting an airflow away from there - which in turn caused a frictional force across the surface of the paper that started a slight rotation…etc…etc…the end result of which is that the paper lands text-side up instead of text-side down.Did we consider the effect of your heartbeat in the initial conditions? Probably not.It’s simply that this problem has vast numbers of degrees of freedom.Now - if you want the answer for a perfectly uniform sheet of material with initial conditions described by abstract equations - and with a sufficiently powerful super-computer - we could undoubtedly produce a convincing simulation of a piece of paper doing it’s thing…but why would this be useful? We still couldn’t do this with any degree of accuracy for a real problem.But why would you even want to? A prediction might be useful - but if the data that drives it is unobtainable - or if the calculation takes too long - then we can’t make use of it.",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,12.8K,314,7.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-will-the-Internet-be-on-Mars

The ground uGreat question, because it often goes overlooked, along with the many other components, teams and systems that must work properly in order to deliver humans or equipment to space.We’ll go through what the parts are, how they interact, and then into the actual effects, damage and repairs.Imagine, if you would, a very slow motion solid rocket booster igniting and launching into the air. The ground underneath the pad (or at the bottom) would have to be angled, so that the flames don’t “bounce” back up, and cause additional heat or vibrations to that very rocket. Notice how right away, we introduced a couple new dangers to any healthy rocket plume:* We already had FLAME / FIRE / PLUME (PRESSURE!)And because of it, we must add the following two as main dangers during a rocket launch:* HEAT / TEMPERATURE(To give you an idea, I’ve posted a photo of thermite. The hottest man-made substance, reaches almost 4000 °F (2200 °C), and burns through asphalt and most everything else… The Shuttle’s SRBs burned at the same or a bit hotter temperatures… more on this below)* VIBRATION / SOUNDSo as we said, the first thing we need to do is deflect that mean hot flaming machine at an angle.Enter the Launch Pad TrenchThe pad’s trench was designed not only to be a stable launch platform for rockets (from Apollo to the Shuttle and on), but in being so it contains components that help maintain and improve that stability.The MFD (Main Flame Deflector): This is a ramp-like structure, at two different angles. One to deflect the Orbiter’s three SSME’s (Space Shuttle Main Engines), and the other side for the SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). These angles are based on studies, calculations, and the meat and potatoes of engineering, in order to help with the three dangers we’ve identified above.Here is an Apollo Era MFD:As mentioned above, the MFD photos shown from this point on will be for the Space Shuttle program, which will show one side of the Flame Face differently shaped/angled than the other.Watch NASA work super-fast at building the Shuttle-era MFD:How does the Trench and MFD look together as a whole in the pad?These are made of multi-layered reflective concrete, thermal tiles, and other materials. Of main concern is not just damage to the Trench for re-usability, but also the potential for FOD (Foreign Object Debris) or “chunks of stuff” flying out and potentially damaging the vehicle at its most critical stage.Now while that solution may help deflect the super-hot flame to the side, it sure does nothing to mitigate the pressure and sound/vibrations during the approximate four seconds that the Shuttle Assembly (commonly known as the stack) will spend in its influence.The study:After NASA failed to convince a lot of people and a few chimpanzees to stand under there with a thermometer during a shuttle launch, modifications to the MFD were made in order to be able to measure this amount of force affecting various areas of the MFD and trench.(this is probably a good time to notice the orbiter’s SSME flame face on the right, vs the much steeper angle of the SRB’s on the left). Shown also are the sensors that detected the amount of force during launch.The results were something like this.Heat rate after one second of launch (SRB’s):In terms of pressure, this is what was recorded after launch:What is 3660 psi (25.2 MPa) in terms of pressure? About 250 bars, or atmospheres. About 7 full-size elephants standing on an area the size of the palm of your hand. Except it would be 7 elephants for each time the palm of a hand fits in that center area pictured above.So 4000–5000 °F (2200–2800 °C) temperatures, 250 bars of pressure… what about vibrations?Another study tells us “Intense acoustic noise and vibration are unavoidable and undesirable by-products generated by the launching of a spacecraft, such as Space Shuttles. The generated noise during firing of rocket engines manifests itself to launch vehicle, sensitive spacecraft and launch pad in the form of airborne acoustics and structure-borne vibration. Therefore, a successful space mission requires thorough consideration of complex sound and vibration interaction of vibro-acoustics effects. The noise and vibration caused by spacecraft rocket engines on launch pads is extremely intense (approximately 180–190 dB) and produces vibration not only of the spacecraft vehicle but also of the launch tower and related support facilities. These vibration levels can be of sufficient magnitude to cause fatigue and eventual failure of some parts. The noise at launch (also during the two-minute liftoff and trans-sonic climb phase through the atmosphere from rocket exhaust and the turbulent boundary layer excitation, separated flows, wake flows and shocks) causes an hostile noise and vibration environment not only for the spacecraft itself but also for the delicate electronics and payload packages aboard. Then, the primary source of structural vibrations and internal loads during launch is due to these acoustic loads.” (Credit Revista chilena de ingeniería).Above we can see the typical vibration time history during a Space Shuttle launch.Above is a diagram describing the main noise and vibration response of pad structures induced by rocket launch.So to help mitigate some of these vibrations, the following is then introduced:The Water Sound Suppression System:Goes something like this (test, without the launch platform).Bubbles have the ability to absorb a remarkable amount of sound. As sound waves propagate through the water and encounter an air bubble, it causes the bubble to compress. The compression converts the sound energy into heat, substantially dampening the noise.NASA makes use of the effect by spraying water molecules into the surrounding air at the Mobile Launcher Platform. Similar to the compression of the bubbles, when water molecules encounter a sound wave, they begin to vibrate, converting the sound energy into heat.The water system protects massive rockets during launch. Seconds before launch, 16 nozzles create a cascade of water which absorbs most of the sound energy. The system is effective enough to reduce the noise by half. It reduces acoustical levels within the orbiter payload bay to about 142 decibels, below the design requirement of 145 decibels.At the time of liftoff, the flow rat...",323 followers,Mario Gravina,791,760,1.7M,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-will-the-Internet-be-on-Mars
