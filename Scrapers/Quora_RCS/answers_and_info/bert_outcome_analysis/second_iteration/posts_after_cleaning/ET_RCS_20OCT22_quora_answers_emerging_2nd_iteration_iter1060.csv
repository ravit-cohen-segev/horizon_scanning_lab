0,The genius or Pakistani who asked this question should find out about Lautenberg Amendment of US which is a law very similar to CAA. Why would US sanction anybody for passing a humanitarian law that aims to help those minorities who are victims of religious persecution in declared Islamic nations? They should rather sanction those who persecute minorities in these three nations.CAA has corollary in US‚Äô Lautenberg Amendment,UNKNOWN,Mritunjay Sharma(‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ),5.4K,212,7M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-USA-will-sanction-Amit-Shah-and-some-ministers-of-India-if-the-Citizenship-Amendment-Bill-is-passed-by-the-Rajya-Sabha

2,NASA defines Deep Space as anything from Mars orbit and beyond. All of those explorers are semi-autonomous robots.The deepest space explorers are rather old because they took a lot of time to get to really deep space - beyond the sun‚Äôs heliosphere.

I was nowhere close to even a regional-Olympiads, let alone International!I started solving problems during my physics club. It took me dozens of problems before I could up my level. I remember one day how I happily approached my teacher and told her: ‚ÄúFast forward, two years and I was solving international Olympiad problems in ease!How? What did I do? What‚Äôs the secret?The secret is‚Ä¶JUST KEEP GOING.Honestly, just keep solving problems and I guarantee that you would get better in this.But DON‚ÄôT just look up the solutions, and think that you solved the problem without understanding it and move on.You need to think about the problems but most importantly you have to getInstead, ask yourself, ‚Äúwhy couldn‚Äôt I solve it?

And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.The key point, however, is this:EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.Nobody is born solving complex problems.

6,"I believe that the solution did not come from your subconscious, but from the combination of your subconscious and your conscious. I find that for difficult problems, the first step is to let the conscious mind work at it very hard, analyze it in every possible way. Only after the conscious mind is exhausted is it time to hand it over. Then ‚Äúsit back‚Äù and relax. Maybe go to sleep. Do something unrelated. Exercise is great. Take a hike.

Suddenly the answer will pop into your head.When this happens to me, I knew I was not getting there consciously, but I also believe that without all that conscious effort, my subconscious would not have succeeded either. The conscious mind is disciplined (or can be), and that discipline is usually essential. But it gets hung up and repeats the same approach. The subconscious mind is more freely moving, and connects ideas from different arenas.I employ this approach very consciously. Some people mistakenly think that they need to beat a problem into the ground. I can tell lots of stories about how walking away from the problem was essential.Yet I feel that a third stage is equally important. The idea has to be turned back to the conscious mind to check it, to work out the numbers, to test its validity. Those three stages are essential for the most challenging problems.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,8.3K,360,25.2M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-USA-will-sanction-Amit-Shah-and-some-ministers-of-India-if-the-Citizenship-Amendment-Bill-is-passed-by-the-Rajya-Sabha
