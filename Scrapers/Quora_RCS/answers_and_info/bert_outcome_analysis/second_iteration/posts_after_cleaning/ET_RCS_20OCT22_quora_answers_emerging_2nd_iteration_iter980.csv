However, the number of problems for which it is known how to do so is extremely small. So our supercomputers could be a thousand times faster than they are now, and it wouldn’t make one iota of difference.Let’s wait until supercomputers can prove mathematical theorems that were discovered by, say, the ancient Greeks.

There’s really nothing like this about C - you can fully understand everything about a “Hello World” program the first time it’s explained to you. So I would say the learning curve for C is much simpler than for some other languages.Also, and again already mentioned elsewhere, many languages are based on the C syntax, so once you learn C and are comfortable with it, the syntax of other C-based languages will be easier to understand. Whether you move on to C++ or Java or C#, having a foundation in C will be useful.Keep in mind too that C is still used primarily in systems programming and is by no means a “dying language”. It’s still very much in demand, so learning it will eventually be good for your resume.","3,225 followers",Vik Paruchuri,2.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-todays-supercomputers-solve-todays-world-unsolved-mathematics-puzzles

No. When China’s Tianhe super computer(Intel CPUs onboard) became the world fastest in 2015, America congress banned Intel to export Xeon processor to China. Then China developed Sunway super computer with Chinese designed CPU and replaced Tianhe to become the new No.1 until 2018.Did USA companies transfer aerodynamics technologies(making cars, planes, jet fighters, missile warheads, etc. ) to China? No. China does even better in hypersonic aerodynamics, when American hypersonic aircraft tests failed again and again, China succeeded again and again.Did USA companies and agencies transfer space technology to China? No. NASA is banned to cooperate with China space agency. Also, China’s application to join ISS project(international space station) was rejected. Now, China will launch its own space station in 2020, while the ISS will retire in 2024, and no further projects. European astronauts began learning Chinese, hoping for a chance to board Chinese space station after ISS retired.I can raise more examples, but that would be too long.The hidden reason to smear and defame China is simple: American governments feared China would replace America in future.

China and Russia are usually the names called most often, though I have no idea if this reflects the frequency of transgressions.Then there’s technology transfer that’s the price of doing a deal. China is such a huge market, and growing so rapidly, that vast number of companies were willing to “share” know-how in exchange for market access. (Confession: I was directly involved in one of those situations.) One could argue — and I did — that this is unfair. The Chinese response — then don’t do business here — is hard to argue with.Which brings us to: What exactly can the US government do? They can fight central policies like minimum local content requirements or caps on foreign ownership. But the recently revised NAFTA agreement includes local content requirements and both the Obama and Trump administrations have refused acquisitions by Chinese companies, citing “national security.”“Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,” and all that.Then there’s both the biggest complication and biggest opportunity: of the world’s 20 largest tech companies by market value, 9 are in China. The idea that China is full of low-cost factories filled with imprisoned workers toiling for slave wages to churn out knock-offs of American products is badly out of date, and was never completely true. In electronic payment systems and drone technology, China is leading the world — and someone else is trying to “share” their technology.If Trump were smart he’d welcome the Chinese to “our” side, and talk about how we collective can strengthen IP protections around the world. He would strengthen the Commercial capabilities of the embassy in Beijing, and work through local Chamber of Commerces to address company-specific issues where they arise. He would make a decision on things like use of Huawei phones in government applications while bearing in mind that the Chinese will repay tit with tat — just as we would if the situation were reversed.In other words, he would have an overarching strategy and a series of tactics for achieving it.Punitive tariffs on steel are not only irrelevant and ineffective, they simply increase costs for American consumers — making us far more likely to purchased finished products from China, resulting in a further loss of jobs.",1 follower,Dawei Chen,633,141,2.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-studying-C-programming-language-as-a-first-language
