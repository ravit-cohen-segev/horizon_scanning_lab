My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power

The currently practical fusion technology is called fission-fusion, where nuclear fission is used to reliably produce the conditions for fusion.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are designs for smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium).Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over gas and diesel cars -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen and an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium are the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, and Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for fusion car applications and deserve close attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be fusion cars?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary. ICF fusion power plants will probably be smaller than MCF fusion and may ultimately be of a size that could be installed in certain transportation vehicles (ships, trains, planes, trucks, and ultimately cars). What will probably be the most practical way to fusion powered vehicles (of a sort) for perhaps the next fifty years is to use stationary fusion power plants to produce electricity and then to use nuclear fusion produced electricity to charge conventional electric vehicles with storage batteries.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion ----------","5,352 followers",Valerio Cietto,1.1K,2.4K,9.1M,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power

You can then take that plasma in a very carefully shaped Electromagnetic field and spit the plasma out the back of your spacecraft.In both of these cases the reaction creates a very hot gas that wants to expand and then you only let it expand in one direction, just like a normal combustion rocket.Only the energy you get out of a chemical rocket is quite cold in comparison to the energy of a nuclear reaction. In fact there is so much energy involved that we basically have no material (not even your diamond chamber) that can reliably contain that energy.Or you could do something stupid and wasteful like explode a nuclear bomb behind your spacecraft and ride the expanding cloud of plasma as it pushes you forward. But, that would be horrendously inefficient as you would lose the majority of your energy out in all directions while you only captured the tiny amount that happened to hit your ship. This concept is used in the so called Orion Project and is known as Nuclear Pulse propultion.If you can contain and direct all the energy of a small fusion fire then you can go very fast indeed! You could even use some of the most abundant fuel in the Universe for cheap! All that power and energy could potentially push a rocket into relativistic speeds! Perhaps even up to half the speed of light! Then turn around and fire your rocket backwards to slow back down before you smash into anything!But to go faster you are going to need much more energy, probably more energy that you can hope to contain within any small manmade machine.","57,707 followers",Jack Fraser-Govil,787,2.6K,42.8M,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power

Reines and Ulam in a Los Alamos memorandum dated 1947.[1] The actual project, initiated in 1958, was led by Ted Taylor at General Atomics and physicist Freeman Dyson, who at Taylor's request took a year away from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton to work on the project.The Orion concept offered high thrust and high specific impulse, or propellant efficiency, at the same time. The unprecedented extreme power requirements for doing so would be met by nuclear explosions, of such power relative to the vehicle's mass as to be survived only by using external detonations without attempting to contain them in internal structures. As a qualitative comparison, traditional chemical rockets—such as the Saturn V that took the Apollo program to the Moon—produce high thrust with low specific impulse, whereas electric ion engines produce a small amount of thrust very efficiently. Orion would have offered performance greater than the most advanced conventional or nuclear rocket engines then under consideration. Supporters of Project Orion felt that it had potential for cheap interplanetary travel, but it lost political approval over concerns with fallout from its propulsion.[2]The Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 is generally acknowledged to have ended the project. However, from Project Longshot to Project Daedalus, Mini-Mag Orion, and other proposals which reach engineering analysis at the level of considering thermal power dissipation, the principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight. Such later proposals have tended to modify the basic principle by envisioning equipment driving detonation of much smaller fission or fusion pellets, although in contrast Project Orion's larger nuclear pulse units (nuclear bombs) were based on less speculative technology.Details of the pusher plate & shock absorber system.A pulse unit (bomb) is shot through the centerline tube and goes off a preset distance from the plate.Details of the specialized nuclear explosives used.

13,"Well, you should read about “Project Orion” - which was a very serious study of almost that exact thing (minus the diamonds…which wouldn’t help…and setting off another nuclear weapon every few minutes for many months!).Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) - WikipediaThis study was done in the 1960’s and early 1970’s and concluded that such a spacecraft is possible - and that it could possibly reach as high as 11% of the speed of light.This is a REALLY careful study - and as far as I know, it’s the only seriously achievable design that anyone has ever come up with that could get a spacecraft abovWell, you should read about “Project Orion” - which was a very serious study of almost that exact thing (minus the diamonds…which wouldn’t help…and setting off another nuclear weapon every few minutes for many months!).Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) - WikipediaThis study was done in the 1960’s and early 1970’s and concluded that such a spacecraft is possible - and that it could possibly reach as high as 11% of the speed of light.This is a REALLY careful study - and as far as I know, it’s the only seriously achievable design that anyone has ever come up with that could get a spacecraft above even 1% of lightspeed.The spacecraft would have to be VAST…millions of tons…because it’s back end has to be sturdy enough to withstand repeated hydrogen bomb blasts - and the shock absorbers that cushion the blow for the astronauts would be several miles long(!) but on the plus side, because it’s required to be so bulky, it could have a crew compartment the size of a small city - and at could carry 100 or more astronauts in great comfort.The project was getting close to the point where they could seriously propose building such a spacecraft when two things happened:The first problem would require some rewriting of treaties (not as easy as it sounds, sadly) - the second problem would require launching the spacecraft from somewhere up in a sufficiently high orbit…which is a good idea - but the cost and effort involved in building such a gigantic ship would be quite impossible with the technology of the day.However…now that SpaceX are talking about their ungodly large (and re-usable) “BFR” spacecraft - it wouldn’t take so many conventional rocket launches to build the Orion spacecraft…so PERHAPS we just have to solve the international treaty problems.",2 followers,Richard Muller,6.3K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power
14,"Helium-3 is a future nuclear fusion fuel. Until now only stars can do that but some people imagine that there will be reactors in the future which will do so.Wikipedia has an article aboutHelium-3 can be used to “breed” Tritium which is used in current fusion experiments, thermonuclear weapons and boosted atomic bombs.Boosted fission weapon - WikipediaIt is theoretically possible with today’s technology to build a huge fission-fusion hybrid plant. Until now not thought to be economical.Helium-3 could replace Lithium as breeding material for Tritium.Tritium - WikiHelium-3 is a future nuclear fusion fuel.

However its low density might be an issue.I’d like to add some historical facts. Be aware that I am talking about Helium-4 or common Helium now. So whenever I say helium I mean just helium-4.Helium is a good coolant and the only neutron moderator which can not absorb even slightly neutrons.Helium nuclear fission reactors could run at very high temperatures.Gas-cooled fast reactor - WikipediaHowever they have not been build due to the fact that helium is expensive , rare and escapes easily.By the way usually gas cooled reactors use carbon dioxide as it is much cheaper than helium.As hybrid reactors are seen as a competition to the fast breeder (The primary purpose of reactors is to produce electricity. However high temperature reactors would allow splitting of water into hydrogen byAn advantage of helium is that it forms no chemical compounds with other metals under operating conditions. Whether or not this is an advantage over NaK , sodium or lead can be argued over.As common helium can not absorb neutrons it also does not form any radioactive isotopes.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power
15,"The nuclear reaction He-3 + H-2 -> He-4 + H-1 yields energy, because the end products of the reaction have less mass than the starting products. It is more difficult to achieve than the usual deuterium-tritium reaction, but a He-3 reactor would be “cleaner” because it produces no neutrons.","29,752 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-nuclear-fusion-power
