Look at relevant examples that were effective for a different product or occuring in nature, and see what insights they gain to implement a new feature into their product. Chinese and Koreans utilize integrated strategy. Figure out the best things to implement. And, do it with great results, and relatively low costs(mostly because they need less r&d because they researched it, or they reverse engineered it and it saved r&d). An example of Chinese product that did this was Tik tok seeing what musically did, and making it easier for anyone to make good content, and to get their content seen. They took an existing idea and saw how it could be copied and improved. The Nio cars from China also did great in cost effectively, and cost efficiently figured out how to get German like quality. Mostly from 50/50 weight distribution, low centre of gravity(easy with battery packs), well optimized suspensions, steering, and well developed (good power curve) motor.In summary, the Chinese and Koreans look at what to copy, and how to tweak what they copied to be a impactful feature in their product. Or, looking at other’s components(motors, steering, suspension) and figuring out insights to how to engineer theirs to higher results(saving some time and costs by figuring out the secret insights).In conclusion, the premium and luxury companies can win against the Chinese companies. A North Face clothing company has a unique brand that is developed. In-house teams that are developed. Components and features need to be unique to the brand so it’s more valuable to that brand. That North Face comfort and oversized style is seen as only looking right for their brand. That brand is theirs. That brand visibility is theirs. Their customer base is theirs. Their features make more impact for them.In short, a companies uniqueness can’t be easily copied or used without being seen as a mockery.

Odin got his ass handed to him by a bunch of Celestials, but not nameless ones.Galactus was able to 1 shot a nameless Celestials. Odin temporarily BFR’d Galactus with a full powered headbutt. I would place a nameless Celestial at around Universal in power.In Star Wars Legends, there are celestials but most of them don’t have feats approching that.However, there is a Novel called Supernatural Encounters. It was published but it was cancelled, meaning it is not part of Legends. However i will use this as there are characters who could beat a Celestial in it.These are the Bedlam Spirits, in the Novel they literally created the Canon universe. They can manipulate time and matter on a universal scale, however due to their childlike manner it is hard to scale them.Now the most powerful Star Wars character would be The Father of Shadows, there is no official image of him so i shall use this image of Melkor as it looks cool.This guy created the multiverse, then went on to create another universe in which all the other Celestials went into.In my opinion, this is the only character that could defeat a nameless Celestial, maybe even a named one.

Zeus doesn’t have as many feats, but he once one-shot the Hulk.In attempt to stop the Celestials when they were determining whether or not to reset life on Earth, Odin tried to stop them by every god in Asgard, including himself, pour their power into the Destroyer Armor. This thing on a normal day is virtually indestructible and Thor has only been able to beat it by drawing out the lifeforce powering it. This time the Destroyer had the energy of dozens of gods powering it and caused it to grow the size of the Celestials, supposedly 2000 feet but the comic didn’t draw them anywhere near that size.Even though the Destroyer being powered by all of Asgard, it still couldn’t stop the Celestials. It’s disintegration beam got deflected, and a giant sword it was carrying could only cause damage the the Celestials ignored thanks to their fast healing powers, one lost an arm and just grew it back.

Fear/hatred of the Chinese government is somewhat understandable.BUTI would urge people to look to the human aspect. To the people of China. Who in my experience of living here for a long time are incredibly warm, kind, loving and pragmatic. I love my life in China. My wife, my children, friends, and extended family are the most incredible people.On many occasions, I have had people on the street share their umbrella with me when I was caught in the rain. I’ve had people escort me to a subway gate when I got lost.Another deep cultural aspect in China is the term “guanxi 关系” very loosely translated to “relationship”, is the foundation of society. It’s a form of accepted societal tradition that pushes us to build bonds with each other and do each other favours to build that relationship. Once a bond is formed that is like family, and we help each other out from time to time as if we are family. That can be seen negatively, like a quid pro quo perhaps. but I think it’s a lot better than the “dog eat dog” ethos. It emphasizes success through bonds formed. Isn’t that a great thing? And I’ll tell you from personal experience, these bonds, are not fake bonds. They develop into deep and meaningful relationships based on trust and helping one another.I’ve never been to a country where the people are more actively friendly than China. I feel extremely privileged to live here.So in answer to your question. Perhaps yes, perhaps a lot of people do hate China. But I don’t think they should and I imagine most of those people have never been here.I think as with any human life, we should look to individuals, cultures, traditions, and just the beauty in everyday life where people are kind and helpful to each other.",22 followers,Joseph Wang,698,28.6K,104.8M,https://www.quora.com/Who-would-win-a-single-Celestial-or-all-of-Star-Wars
