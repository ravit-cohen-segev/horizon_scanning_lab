The most powerful system of this type belongs to Nvidia actually (Ranked#7), where they just used 50 to 60 racks of their headquarter datacenter to house it.",21 followers,Jeff Nelson,512,1.6K,23M,https://www.quora.com/Do-data-centers-uses-super-computers

2,"There is an Operating System called OpenIndiana; I hope that comes close enough. You can always create a fork of Linux and call it IndianOS.Building an Operating System can be done by 1000 programmers in 10 years. It’s more a question of why you want to do so. These days the idea has become more attractive because governments realise that computers are critical infrastructure and they cannot control equipment built in a foreign country, that might be used to spy on them.",0 followers,Xiao Jin,4.4K,61,231.3K,https://www.quora.com/Do-data-centers-uses-super-computers

6,"This is somewhat easy to answer!There are several others, like workshops, regional level events, Mellanox and several other vendor sponsored ones which are quite decent. I will list them separately.Also many of the very distinct sub domains of HPC deserve their own mention.
