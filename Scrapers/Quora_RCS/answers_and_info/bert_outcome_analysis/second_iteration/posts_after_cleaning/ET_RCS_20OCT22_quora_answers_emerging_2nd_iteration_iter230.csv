As such, we have been trying for decades to create a controlled fusion without success.It is true, there are pharaonic projects like ITER which do hope to create commercial reactors but this is still hope and not a certainty. Furthermore, if it ever happens, it will need huge facilities as the conditions needed in terms of temperature are gigantic.Nobody at this point in time can give us a hint on what is probable. These structures would not only be huge but may also require very tight maintenance with a limited life span, you have to remember that the temperature in the heart would be at 150 million degrees. As such, even it works, it won’t come cheap and may not be a universal solution.Another thing to consider which is nearly as important, energy production is only part of the issue, The advantage of gasoline is the simple fact that it is easy to store, easy to transport, easy to refill, and creates a good weight energy ratio. As such, we will need to have not only energy production but also better storage and transportation. As an example, batteries today are expensive to produce, consume a lot of rare elements, and don't last long. This is not a long term solution either,What is obvious to me is the simple fact that Fusion energy may come in as an expensive way to produce energy. It is very possible that less elaborate means like dams or solar power may be less expensive in the long run. If it is so, fusion may become the last option for power-hungry nations with high technical capabilities but not an option for the countries which cannot afford it.If we are able to produce sustainable cheap fusion energy, it won't be a revolution because we already have cheap energy. What we are speaking is about changing from one way to produce electricity in another way mostly because of oil rarefaction. This shouldn’t change our way of life but make it sustainable long term. Hardly a revolution but rather a slow transformation. Let’s remind everybody we still huge oil and oil equivalents reserves. We can afford to have a relatively slow turnover whatever is the alternate solution.In the best-case scenario, fusion will allow us to keep our way of life but it is far from a given.

Reliable and clean energy makes virtually all other major problems confronting mankind including -2. Water3. Food4. Environment5. Poverty6. Terrorism and war7 Disease8. Education9. DemocracyI0. Populationeasier to solve.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that used impure fission-fusion to produce fusion energy. Ivy-Mike was mankind’s first successful approach to reliably producing fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion while using a small nuclear fission device to bring Deuterium fusion plasma to fusion conditions (temperature, confinement time, and plasma density). Today, there are much smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ of energy per shot.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy as would be released when efficiently burning about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to a spot of less than a 2 mm diameter) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Mini-Mike pure fusion deviceA laser or ion-beam fusion driver irradiates a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere from the left, which initiates D-T fusion which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a pressurized liquid deuterium filled tube.Cold War era Halite-Centurion field test experiments[1] showed that an intense beam of X-rays is sufficient to produce full fusion ignition of small amounts (grams) of Deuterium-Tritium fuel held in small hollow spheres mounted at a remote distance from the X-ray source.Successful ICF DT fusion ignition is not a matter of conjecture or technical speculation but is rather an observed fact. With the 1952 Ivy-Mike test, ICF fusion moved from just another fusion technology of promise to a practical fusion technology that could be repeatedly demonstrated on demand.This puts ICF fusion in a slightly different position than any other form of fusion today. Technical demonstration of ignition has been experimentally demonstrated. A practical form of ICF fusion has been experimentally shown to repeatedly work in independent experiments fielded by both LLNL and LANL Field Test Divisions over the course of ~10 years (Halite-Centurion series tests).After more than sixty years of experiments in hundreds of different experimental fusion devices and hundreds of thousands of separate shots, only ICF fusion has experimentally demonstrated fusion ignition and fusion net energy generation.For a brief period in the mid-1970s (Nixon Administration), the major US DOE Labs considered building practical fusion reactors based on the form of ICF nuclear fusion we currently can reliably achieve. These experiments and designs were part of PACER program, which was only active as a project for about 3 years and did not result in actual fusion reactor hardware (but which did result in preliminary ultra-clean PACER device designs which efficiently maximize production of energy from fusion while minimizing the energy from fission required to initiate each fission-fusion shot). Project PACER also produced preliminary PACER reactor designs.PACER fusion - ""PACER Revisited"" -The Nixon Administration, in a mid-1970s effort intended to try to keep a campaign promise to balance the Federal Budget, cut both Thorium Molten Salt Reactor and PACER Fusion research as cost cutting measures at approximately the same time.The Dr. Ralph Moir ""PACER Revisited"" paper contains a description of the LLNL small closer to commercial molten salt version of PACER.http://www.ralphmoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pacerRev891.pdfIn the intervening 40 years advances in design of pure fusion experimental devices have been made (but no experimental pure fusion devices have as yet been built or successfully tested).Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). In the final few years on underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has been experimentallyIf fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.[1] - NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

Energy is critical for society’s growth and success.Current government research indicates that fusion reactors will require massive structures and be phenomenally expensive. On the other hand, there are also ""amateur"" scientists working in their garages -- their devices are much smaller (and fit the tiny budgets they have).If the government research pans out, except for potential environmental improvements, there won't be a major change to society when fusion comes online. Although raw fuel costs may be reduced, the same distribution methods will be required and the capital costs will remain astronomical.At the other extreme, one can imagine a ""lucky"" inventor developing a small fusion reactor in his basement that powers micro-grids. If this happens, the cost of energy will plummet over the following twenty five years. Fuel costs go to essentially zero. Distribution and transmission costs (over 40% of the cost today) are substantially reduced or eliminated. The remaining costs are capital expenditures and maintenance. Depending on the shielding required, these devices may be inexpensive to build. Maybe like today's portable generators, but with a containment vessel. In this highly speculative scenario, electricity might be as low as 1/10th of today's cost. If so, electricity availability worldwide will grow substantially.(The same thing can be said of other clean/renewable, micro-grid capable sources. Fusion's advantage is that it 'burns' a fuel and is therefore available 24/7. The advantage of the other sources is that they're real and available today)Regardless of the scenario, large or small, if fusion comes online at a price-point significantly below fossil fuel systems, oil-propped regimes will teeter and fail. Wars may break out in the middle-east. But, because oil will be much less important, outside meddling will be significantly reduced. Also, several of the world's largest companies will become irrelevant.If the cost of energy falls (and AI takes over), the cost of ground and sea transportation will becomes primarily a capital expense. Because shielding is heavy, air travel will remain fossil-fuel based until aneutronic reactors are available, small, and light.If fusion (or any of the clean/renewables) takes off in a way that obviates fossil fuels, the environment stops incurring the associated deleterious effects.If fusion reduces the financial and carbon costs sufficiently, many projects become much more viable, such as desalination plants and energy-intensive carbon-capture processes. Maybe we can start repairing the environmental damage already done.The cost of energy is embedded in virtually everything we use. Aluminum, for example, is created using massive amounts of electricity. The food we eat requires energy to plant, grow, harvest, process, transport, sell, and cook. Offices and homes are illuminated, heated, and cooled. The device you're reading this uses electricity.Reducing the cost of energy means everyone has a bit more for themselves. The energy sector is about a five trillion dollar industry, a bit over $500 per person annually. The average annual worldwide per-capita income is under $3,500. So, if energy costs are reduced substantially, the entire world will benefit.Maybe fusion will do some or all of this for us.

If we unlock it (Probably unlocking it requires a lot of skill points and countless money.), our civilization will enter a ""new height"", and we will see a ""different blue sky"", just like our ancestors unlocked the ""Fire"".(Using fire is used to scare off animals, roast foods, and to ""burn water"" to generate electricity.)The Process of Civilization has begun, and we can not retreat. Maybe God has set up an insurmountable ""filter"" in front of humans, but we have no choice but to go forward without hesitation. Because in this game, God only gave us two options: either die on Earth or ""unlock the skill on Tech Tree"" to explore our own future.Yes, controlled nuclear fusion is almost the only choice for future energy. If we can't get it out in a few hundred years, human beings will basically lose the opportunity to become ""Interstellar Civilization"" and always ""trapped on the earth!"" Because once ""fossil energy"" use up, aren't we dependent on hydropower, solar energy, wind energy to drive particle accelerators? Go mining minerals and launch rockets!? Stop dreaming. It’s bad enough if every household can only turn on a little light ~The following are pessimistic predictions (TL;DR):Sadly, unlike most people think, technological progress is not accelerated. It may be that some technical threshold is too high, leading to the inability of most civilizations to cross and to conduct interplanetary navigation.Humans have spent nearly 60 years on controllable nuclear fusion, and the substantial progress is basically 0. Even if the world is united, ITER's engineering progress is still delayed. In the history of human science, no technology has taken such a long time, seemingly within reach, but there is no way to break through.I hazarded that Controlled nuclear fusion technology is The Great Filter.The reason why the universe is deadly silent is probably that there is a threshold in the process of civilization development, which causes most or all civilizations to fail to cross it.What is the threshold? It is to master nuclear energy technology!There are near-infinite hydrogen and helium in our universe. If we master nuclear fusion technology, it means that our civilization can leave the planet of our born, and we will survive for a long time in interstellar space. Even leave our galaxy to explore the wider universe.There are near-infinite hydrogen and helium in our universe. If we master nuclear fusion technology, it means that our civilization can leave the planet of our born, and we will survive for a long time in interstellar space.Any civilization that can achieve controllable nuclear fusion obtains an almost infinite negative entropy flow theoretically. Even if there is no qualitative change at the technical level, it can survive for nearly ever. At this stage of civilization, the cost of launching unmanned detectors will become low. In the continuation of the almost infinite civilization, the number of detectors that will eventually be launched will reach an astonishing level.If we realize the controllable nuclear fusion, our aerospace propulsion technology may undergo qualitative changes, which is far from being achieved by the so-called new energy. At that time, the speed of the spacecraft will be significantly improved, and navigation within the stellar system will become easy. We will become a true fourth-order civilization--We can build a spacecraft, even if it is gone, but the controlled nuclear fusion technology makes the ecological self-circulation system possible. The spacecraft can last for millions of years. Some detectors will start from generation to generation and fly to the starry sky.Considering the distribution of resources in the universe (mostly light elements), any civilization that recognizes the principle of stellar luminescence is a rational choice for solving energy and power.If people in developing countries around the world want to live like in developed countries, we need about 4.5 earths resources, then we must find various resources we need from space. They are in the solar system. The limits of the earth's resources can only feed 100 billion people, and the resources of the solar system can feed 10^16 people, equivalent to 100,000 earths:The meaning of controlled nuclear fusion cannot be overestimated.Where is the alien detector?In theory, as long as we can reach the fourth level, even if we are eventually trapped in our solar system, the cost of launching unmanned detectors will so low that leave a lot of traces in the universe. This is the same for other civilizations.Alien wisdom life may have been destroyed by its own reasons. These reasons may include nuclear war, bioterrorism or the reverse elimination of civilization. But even so, some of their technical achievements should be preserved.In fact, we humans have already done this: Voyager 1 has reached dozens billion miles outside the Earth. In just a few decades, humans have launched many detectors before and after. Even if humanity is completely destroyed as a race, we will at least have five human exploration devices wandering outside the solar system, telling the story of human civilization.Human civilization will undoubtedly continue to launch probes into the universe in the future, and the number will not be small.There are astronomical stars in the universe, so there may be astronomical civilizations and definitely not only that the earth can evolve civilization.. As long as they can evolve to a higher level than the current level of human technology, the cost of launch is considerably reduced, and the number of detectors launched will fill the universe.Why is the universe deadly silent? That's some fridge-horror!!Let's make such a rough estimate: the Milky Way's diameter is about 100,000 light-years. A highly intelligent civilization, even at a speed of one-thousandth of the speed of light, can only cross the Milky Way for 100 million years. This time is much smaller than the age of the Milky Way (10 billion years). Therefore, if the wisdom civilization that emerged earlier than human beings spreads outward, it should have spread throughout the galaxy and even the entire universe.One possible implementation is the automaton (Von Neumann type machine), a self-replicating machine: alien civilizations launch many micro-automatic machines outward, landing in suitable environments such as planets and satellites, comets, etc.They collect raw materials and create next-generation automata; then starting from the landing point, continue to expand outward. Such an automaton can detect galaxies of the Milky Way size within 500,000 years if it has 5% of the speed of light. If there are civilizations in the Milky Way that are more than 500,000 years ahead of the Earth, humans should have observed this wisdom civilization.As of today, human exploration of the universe has made great strides. Within the solar system, all planets and a number of important satellites have spacecraft to survey, and asteroids and comets have also launched special detectors for research; for stars outside the solar system, humans have been listening to radio signals from them; Humans can even use telescopes to observe relatively close stars, find the planets around them from the light intensity and spectrum of stars, and analyze the size, structure, composition of the atmosphere, surface temperature and other information. All these search operations have so far found no signs of alien civilization.The earliest civilization recognized at present is the Sumerian civilization, about 5,000 years old. If there are a large number of civilizations that can sail freely in the stellar space, their means of observation should far exceed the current level of human technology. In the 5,000-year history, why are there no records of visits by aliens or shape detectors? So far, human history has not left a record of following the rules of reason, indicating the existence of alien civilization.The universe is full of silence. For thousands of years, humankind has been unable to discover other alien civilizations through various means. It feels that the vast cosmos is like a great wasteland. There is no such thing except for human beings.The silence is unreasonable: the conditions for the earth to produce our civilization are not harsh, the time is not long, the universe is so big, the time it takes is so long, how can it be only one earth Civilization?This means that it is difficult for civilization to master nuclear fusion technology. There may be almost no civilization to cross this level!?From the current theoretical reserve, technical level and complexity development trend, the difficult to pass the sieve is the key technology from the third-level civilization to the fourth-level - controllable nuclear fusion.“Since nuclear fusion is so difficult to master, let's try to master it slowly? It takes only 10,000 years for human beings to enter agricultural civilization, and it has only been a few hundred years since entering industrial civilization…anyway, don’t we have lived well now?”Think about it. If it is only a matter of time, then other ancient civilizations in our universe have existed for billions of years.2. The fossil energy is UnsustainableThe cruellest fact of this is that if our civilization can't break through this barrier in a short time after we mastering chemical energy, we will permanently lose this opportunity!!The reason is simple - the bio-energy used by agricultural civilization is a continuous transformation from solar energy, but the petroleum, coal, and natural gas on which the Fossil Energy used by industrial civilization depend on the precious savings of solar energy in the past hundreds of millions of years on the earth.We are currently consuming a lot of fossil energy to leech off their earth's capital, because oil and coal are the legacies of human settlement after hundreds of millions of years of precipitation. It is estimated that at the current rate of human industrialization, the fossil energy of the earth will be hundreds of years later. The consumption is exhausted, and the nuclear fission uranium reserves are limited, and the research on thermonuclear fusion has not progressed.I believe that the division of civilization levels can be marked by the distance that the group can reach:We can now say that we have reached the third level. Even if we do what we can, we can reach Mars barely with the help of chemical rockets, but we are powerless to go to other planets. Flying out of the solar system is far from reach.Traditional energy sources are exceptionally inefficient, and it is difficult to provide the power needed for high-speed of Spacecraft. The chemical engine rockets are hard to reach Kepler 452b even if we burn out all the fossil energy in the earth to support it!!From the beginning of the development of such Fossil Energy to the end of the day when these energy sources are exhausted, if we cannot master nuclear energy, our entire industrial civilization will game over~Because there is no more oil and coal to support social development and higher technology research, human beings will lose the opportunity to move toward a god-level civilization and be trapped on this small earth forever!Our earth civilization has entered a crucial point! In this dark cosmic forest, the fossil energy on the planet is a small match. We must use it to ignite the fusion reactor before the match is burned:From the perspective of the silence of the universe, the possibility of human breakthrough success is minimal. The sieve in front of it may be the ultimate fate of humankind. The endless starry sky is the driving force of human progress, but it may also be the goal that human beings will never reach?Are we humans have not left the cradle of the earth but die in this cradle? Desperate!?3.

But don't forget that in the past 50 years, our progress in nuclear fusion technology has been 0!On the other hand, the trend of globalization and human rights in the past few decades has brought about the hedonism and money worship in the world. Plus, the entropy growth rate needed to maintain the increasingly luxurious life of humankind is incredible. If human society does not undergo revolutionary changes, the done of our community will eventually become a foregone conclusion.Environmentalists say: ""We can't pin the future of mankind on a completely unreliable adventure."" Yes, because of energy problems, we give up to explore space, give up resources of 100,000 Earths in the solar system, and just huddle in this small blue planet, we will pin our future to the cause of environmental protection and live a life of thrift.The irony is that even a green life-saving energy can't stop the ecological economy from collapsing. The only thing that can be successful in environmental protection is to prevent development immediately. But once the capitalist behemoth stops developing, our societies will entirely collapse.negative entropy flowLooking back at human history is a history of chasing negative entropy. In the early stages, if we overproduce in a specific area and eat up the output on the ground, we will migrate to a place with food. We have stepped out of the African savanna slowly. Migration is the most common means for human civilization to solve the pressure of survival. In the end, human beings are spread all over the world.Now, we may have indeed encountered a big problem.The acquisition cost of the negative entropy flow is getting higher and higher, which will have a significant impact on our social structure. For taking precautions, humans may need to change some of the ideas that have developed over the past 300 years, and don't make it for granted that technology will last forever. It is irresponsible to base the future of civilization on the illusion that technology continues to explode.But what I must emphasize is thatMaintaining the current industrial civilization requires massive negative entropy--The energy that humans need every year is so great that fossil energy that has been formed for hundreds of millions of years will be exhausted in hundreds of years.The nuclear fission resources are limited, and now only account for a small proportion of human primary energy consumption. If nuclear fission is used, there will be a breeder reactor, and the time that can be supported is limited. Even if humans can penetrate the earth's crust and acquire deep resources, humans ignite in a closed room, and the accumulation of toxic gases in the atmosphere will kill the future of mankind!4. Is the resource-limited or the end of the border?""Since there are so many resources, the level that modern technology can achieve is enough for the public to have a good day. Why do we have to rush out of the earth?""Compared with interstellar travel or nuclear war, all human beings who have gained democracy are most likely to indulge in wearing VR headsets, jerk off or even the electrode directly stimulates the brain. After all, this is more likely to be the future of human civilization.Many systems and concepts of modern human society—freedom, democracy, and equality—are cultivated in the era of technological advancement and gradually opening up new frontiers.In 1893, at the annual meeting of the American Historical Society in Chicago,The election of Donald Trump can also be seen as a result of the contraction of the US frontier.The Case for Mars The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We MustAncient Chinese civilization is a living example--After the middle of the Tang Dynasty, with the fixed frontier of China's agricultural civilization, there was no new room for expansion, and the Chinese culture attracted a period of technological stagnation.The geographical environment of ancient Chinese civilization is unique. The desert in the northwest, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the west, the tropical jungle in the southwest, the snow-covered tundra in the north and the sea in the east make it difficult for Chinese civilization and other civilizations at the same level to communicate on a large scale.In contrast, the exchanges around the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean are much more frequent. Therefore, the degree of isolation between ancient Chinese civilization and other major civilizations is second to none on the Eurasian continent, resulting in the difference between Chinese civilization and them far more prominent than the differences between the remaining civilizations (except for the ancient Native American civilizations that were extinct).Ancient Chinese civilization, especially the Chinese civilization after the Qin and Han Dynasties, was far ahead in the East Asian region. Chinese civilization entered an era of technological stagnation early. In the history of more than 1,000 years, due to the inherent structural characteristics of Chinese civilization, it has never opened the door to the era of great navigation and industrialization. The space limit and technological stagnation eventually led to the Chinese civilization began to fall into the Malthusian dilemma after the middle Tang Dynasty, and the chaos cycle appeared again and again.After the technology stagnation, the technology spread, and the surrounding barbarians narrowed the gap with the Central Plains dynasty in military technology. Therefore, the barbarian regime after the Tang Dynasty has far more combat power and difficulty than the previous Xiongnu and Turkic.The Chinese civilization began to turn to monolithic, and the concentration of authoritarianism was increasing, which in turn inhibited the development of technology.If without external involvement (Western expansion), Chinese civilization will be trapped in its own paradigm until the farming environment has completely collapsed.Therefore, expanding space is the most significant thing for us. If there is no front line for growth and no new space for technological development, Malthusianism will come true—In a closed area, the thermodynamic equilibrium is a nightmare for all, and the diversity of human society will be.The scary thing is that the entropy increase of human society is high now. Not necessarily waiting for resources to run out,The R&D mechanism formed in the past 100 years seems to be unable to cope with the new technological ladder. Where is the problem? Any device that has been running for a long time will ""bad money driving out good money,"" resulting in an increase in the entropy value within the system. Many factors are constraining the release of human potential, and the R&D mechanism itself needs a paradigm revolution.This problem is real. It is related to the survival of human beings. When you think about it, it will be deeply imprinted into your mind.The dark clouds of Easter Island have been hovering over the top of human beings. While each of us is going to work every day, earning money, raising a family, and making a living, but please don’t forget that we are human beings:Even if we end up noting the fate of the wheel of the universe, we should die with dignity, and this dignity requires you, me and all human members to cast together~","29,752 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

The small Israeli reactor was spherical in shape and was powered by a solution of Am-242(NO3)3 in water. When a fission reactor is very small in size (<10 cm radius sphere) it requires relatively less combined shielding to fully enclose the reactor with an adequate gamma and neutron shield. Really small fission reactors become much more practical if good light weight and compact shielding approaches are used.The minimum critical mass (water reflected) that can be formed is 6.6 g of Am-242m.Los Alamos has recent experience building truly small nuclear reactors using many off the shelf components to reduce cost. LANL is currently testing their kilowatt power space fission reactor called KRUSTY (KilowattSmall fusion reactors for providing power tend to be discounted because no one to date has built a fusion reactor that actually generates net power.Fusion has however many significant advantages for truly small nuclear power generation applications -Some advantages of fusion for building truly small reactors.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) are the most abundant elements in the universe, fully 10^10 times more abundant than any combination of fission fuels.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Fast Neutrons are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield than penetrating fission produced gammas.While laboratory pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has worked since 1952) producing fusion power reliably on demand[2].Proton-Boron-11 fusion is a current interest for the fusion community. p-B11 fusion produces primarily alpha-particles which are easy to shield and have attractive intrinsic safety features for human operators - all of which is vital for a small reactor application. While p-B11 is expected to produce a few neutrons through side reactors, this style of fusion is a good candidate for safely powering small reactor applications.Inertial Confinement Fusion of p-B11 fuel for small reactor applicationsIt has been calculated that ion temperatures of DT ignited targets reach very high values, exceeding 200 keV. This is the temperature above which proton-boron 11 fusion reactivity arrives to high enough levels to be relevant for energy production (and to obtain high fusion energy gain). In the same DT explosion wave, electron temperatures remain at a lower value, usually below 100 keV, which is a helpful feature to reduce radiation and conduction losses from the plasma. A scheme potentially can be devised to exploit proton-boron 11 fusion by using an Inertial Confinement staged fusion device design initiating a controlled fusion deflagration wave in a p-B11 fusion secondary stage while using a much smaller DT “spark” primary stage. This maximizes the production of fusion energy from p-B11 while reducing the size and cost of the required ICF fusion driver (laser or particle beam).[1] - Y.

As someone who believes that A) I’m nowhere near good enough at math to find the solution to fusion and B) The perfect is the enemy of the good; I’m gonna keep working on better fission reactors, which is something I can get my head around. So with that in mind, you ask why not build thorium reactors…I am going to assume you mean thorium in a molten salt with no definable fuel structure…aka LFTR. If not, Westinghouse actually already built and (a utility) ran a thorium reactor in Pittsburgh and sold its power for years (Shippingport). However, the contention that thorium reactors are easy to develop and necessarily safer than uranium or plutonium reactors is false. LFTRs are very challenging to develop and it is very hard to make a case that they are, in fact, safer than the best current reactor technologies. Today, AP1000 plants, ESBWR, and NuScale are so safe that it becomes very difficult to numerically improve on them. Trust me…I’ve tried twice and we’ve basically broken probabilistic risk assessment (i.e., we couldn’t really get a better safety number). Nuclear plants do not need to get safer, they need to get cheaper and faster to build. Sometimes, the properties which allow your reactor to be cheap also allow it to be safe, and that’s when you win (that’s what I like to think the lead-cooled fast reactor I’m developing will do).So why are MSRs/LFTRs not just braindead exercises to develop? Why is it not a conspiracy led by big, evil organizations like Westinghouse and GE to keep us on “outdated” technology? I shall plagiarize myself.Here’s a post I wrote for a Coursera course I was TA’ing. Some of the points may be slightly debatable (or not applicable to all MSR/LFTR designs), but I hope it paints a clear picture as to the difficulty in MSRs. It can also be said that rarely is one challenge eliminated without another one coming up…so be careful what you write away with a “well I can get rid of graphite by using X” or something like that. I can say, having spoken to contemporaries at different, and well-known companies (and National Labs) beside my own (Westinghouse) that I am not alone in this thinking. Lastly, I must say that this really represents my personal thoughts on the issues and not those of my employer.I'm going to focus on the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR) because that seems to be the most popular.So first, let me cover the basic operational theory and advantages of a LFTR. The idea is that you'd have a molten salt coolant. This coolant is comprised of fluoride, lithium, and beryllium. This forms two salts, lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. This coolant has great properties in heat capacity, boiling point, vapor pressure, and neutronics. This makes it relatively transparent to neutrons, a great heat conductor, and it maintains a low pressure in the vessel, allowing operation at atmospheric pressure. Fluoride salts are extremely stable and therefore well suited to a high-radiation environment. Additionally, the fission products (which I'll speak to in a bit) tend not to form compounds with the beryllium, lithium, or fluoride.Interspersed with the salt is the fuel, in this case thorium and some form of seed material (uranium or plutonium). The salt/fuel mixture passes through a “core” where graphite moderator resides as well as a control device. The fissioning happens in this “core,” heating the mixture and irradiating the thorium. The thorium is bred into uranium 233 through this irradiation. The uranium 233 is an excellent fissile fuel (as opposed to the fertile thorium) and sustains continued reactions. Or course this fission releases a nasty brew of fission products. What's nice in a LFTR is that the salt is constantly filtered and these are removed. This means there is never a large amount of decay heat present in the reactor system. It also means that xenon and samarium don't build up. These are strong neutron absorbers and ultimately limit how much uranium is burned in a normal PWR (hence why we still have about 1% U235 and 0.7% Pu when we're done burning). Also, as there is low decay heat, low pressure, and the system is designed for a molten/solid mixture already--”meltdowns” don't really happen, nor does a reactor accident with a lot of energy driving fission product release. Leaks tend to be self healing too, as the salt will solidify, plugging the leak.Some other advantages include less activated metals in the core. The salt, fuel, and graphite see the majority of neutron radiation. Only a small amount of metal sees significant neutron flux. This makes decommissioning easier in some ways (more on that later). LFTRs also don't produce much in the way of long term waste. As the mixture is constantly filtered, elements don't stay in the coolant long enough to build up to long-lived transuranics. In fact, they also are particularly good at fissioning some of these long-lived elements as well, making them good burner reactors too without some of the difficulties of fast reactors. They also produce lots of useful medical and rare earth isotopes/materials. The processing pulls these out in usable, commercial amounts. Lastly, the high temperatures allow for high efficiencies in the thermodynamic cycle. This has a huge impact on plant economics.Of course, not everything is roses. There are numerous challenges/difficulties with LFTRs.A primary one is lithium 6 contamination in the salt. While pure lithium 7 is produced for reactors today (lithium hydroxide used to alkalize reactor chemistry), it is unbelievably expensive (~$1000/kg) and its manufacture carefully controlled by the government. The amount of lithium 6 allowed in an MSR's salt is astonishingly low as well, making it likely that any separation process will be expensive (not to mention the quantity which needs to be generated). Beryllium is also VERY expensive (also around $1000/kg).Another consideration for a lot of MSRs (and the LFTR in particular), is the fact that fission products and transuranics are purified out of the coolant/fuel constantly. This has lots of advantages, but also causes certain proliferation challenges which are very frequently glossed over. As was mentioned, an initial seed material is typically needed. This comes in the form of a high-enriched uranium typically. So, you're starting with an HE material (proliferation risk), producing Pu239 from the U238 present and then filtering it before it forms Pu240 (aka high grade Pu239: proliferation risk). Additionally, the filtering of the salts can also pulls out protactinium. This gives access to high grade U-233, a bomb material (used in the Davy Crocket W-54 warhead). Lastly, filtering also gives access to neptunium which is judged by U.S. Weapons designers as similar to U235 in weapons usability. It's difficulty of production has prevented its use in warheads (at least to my knowledge), but it remains a very impressive weapons material.The fact that the fuel is actually in the coolant and suspended through the entire loop poses some challenges as well. From a controllability standpoint, LFTRs are challenged by delayed neutrons. Delayed neutrons are the magic gift from God that allow reactors to have easy steady state control. Basically the majority of neutrons needed to keep the reaction critical are prompt...aka they occur directly from other fissions and, given the timescales involved, can cause very fast changes in power. However, a small percentage of neutrons are delayed, in that they come from the decay of fission products. There are 6 groups of delayed neutron emitters we look at in reactor physics. They emit neutrons with timescales in the few second to couple minute range. This means we can “creep up” on criticality. With the coolant circulation time, roughly half of these are lost, meaning the reactor has to operate closer to prompt criticality. This is a situation where enough prompt neutrons are available to drive fast power changes. This means LFTRs will be less stable during fast transients. The thermal properties of the salt and graphite likely will mean this isn't a safety risk, but an unstable reactor is still not a good thing for an operator, regulator, or commercial venture.The presence of fuel and fission products throughout the RCS also causes other challenges. The delayed neutrons lost outside of the core (mentioned previously) will introduce low-level material activation all throughout the RCS. Additionally, the incredibly complex mixture of fission products now floating around results in plating out of noble metals. This is challenging in maintenance and decommissioning space due to contamination and is also a concern for heat exchanger performance, flow path area reduction, and in the potentially deleterious impacts on mechanical components like valves, pumps, control mechanisms etc. Some of the fission products are also corrosive or damaging (like tellurium), attacking some of the high-grade metals typically used in reactors (my PhD friend cites this as another primary challenge). I'm sure the NRC and other regulating bodies will have a field day with the “What-ifs” caused by this potential.The use of graphite in the core is challenging for several reasons. One is the fact that graphite in areas of high neutron flux tends to degrade quickly over time. It swells, builds up internal stresses, and generally becomes unusable over time. It is likely that the graphite would need replaced frequently (estimates of 4 years were given in the 1960s). Graphite also tends to have increasingly favorable moderation properties for U233 as temperature increases. This leads to a positive thermal reactivity coefficient (aka, more temperature = faster reaction). This is no bueno in reactor design. Unfortunately, the designs required to avoid this make thorium breeding more challenging. So it's going to be a strong regulatory challenge to balance breeding, safety, and regulatory confidence (safety and regulatory confidence aren't always the same thing).Lastly, if you happen to screw up operationally, you could end up having frozen salts in your reactor loop. Liquifying these salts could prove rather difficult, although not impossible. This is not totally dissimilar to the Russian Alfa sub reactors which used lead bismuth coolant. They needed constant heating when the cores were not critical. Occasionally this was lost and the reactors froze solid, destroying them. I believe there are solutions which have been devised, I just worry more about the required inspections after liquefying the salt again. I'm sure it would be a long and arduous process. Lots of ""what-ifs"" again.Keep in mind that none of the above challenges are impossible to design around. What scares me more than the ability to formulate a solution is the ability to both formulate the solution and get it licensed. And while some might dismiss the proliferation risks, I think all of them are technically more feasible from a weapons creation standpoint than anything that exists in a LWR, yet we are still hounded by proliferation concerns with little basis in reality. So I think the LFTR would prove a juicy target for people of that mindset. I think China's LFTR program will likely find success. They have the right combination of unlimited funding, an open regulator, and no public interference allowed which can make things like this happen.I welcome LFTRs, FHRs, Gas Reactors, and other novel options. More the merrier is my opinion. What irks me is the attitude that some have which is that ""X"" new technology is so straight forward and simple that we should stop what we're doing, abandon it, and immediately shift our focus to the new thing. At some point you have to say, ""This is what we have right now, it's a good technology, and we're moving forward with it."" Often, the perfect is the biggest enemy of the good...especially when you're dealing with the timescales present. According to some, our window for climate change is measured in a small number of decades (BTW, I do not offer opinion on climate change...outside of my expertise). Our timetables on the U.S. grid stability is shorter still. As such, I think moving forward with today's excellent LWRs (AP1000, EPR, APWR, ABWR, ESBWR, VVER-TOI/AES2006) is a smart move. I don't see any imminent danger with moving forward with those models.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.4K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

The problem is that it is not happening; mostly as a result of how we regulate fission nuclear in the US (and in allied Western nations).Current law and regulatory obstacles to innovation raises the cost of commercial development of new fission reactors to levels that price out of participation all but the largest nuclear industry participants. It currently costs a nuclear startup approximately US$1 billion to prepare the document package for an NRC reactor design certification action - and the full cost must be provided by the nuclear startup up front a decade before any potential sales of the new reactor can occur. The current innovation environment for fission power generation is unfriendly, to the point that no new technology nuclear reactor (other than Naval reactors and ultra-small reactors for NASA deep space missions) have been commercially introduced and physically built in four decades. The first AP-1000s Gen-III+ LWRs are now under construction in the US, but have not yet been completed (and given developments of the last year - may not be completed ever). The historical record of completed fission reactors versus reactor project started and then abandoned in the US since NRC became nuclear regulator is dismal - with more reactor projects abandoned than completed under NRC regulatory supervision.Current Obstacles to fission reactor innovation -If you want to innovate and build a fission reactor you need from NRC -1) A design certification to ensure your basic reactor design is safe – cost ~$200 million2) A COL license to allow you to construct and operate your fission reactor – cost ~ $60 million3) Once licensed, you will have to pay each year an operating fee to NRC of ~$5 million dollars whether your reactor is operating or not – whether it is producing electricity or process heat or not.4) A license to obtain fission nuclear fuel for your prototype reactor must be obtained from NRC - private sale or purchase of nuclear fuels is illegal and can result in jail time.5) A Waste Confidence Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared and submitted to NRC to describe how you plan to sequester any nuclear waste produced by your fission reactor prototype. NRC must approve your plan before you are allowed to let your reactor to go critical and produce any fission power. Your will need to pay NRC staff evaluating your Environmental Impact Statement at a rate of $265 an hour until such time as NRC staff are satisfied with all elements of your plan.6) When you decide you can no longer continue operating your prototype reactor, you will have to pay NRC during reactor decommissioning. Former reactor operators are required to pay NRC staff at a rate of $265 per hour of time they are involved in supervising the decommissioning of your reactor prototype.In contrast, the regulatory obstacles for Fusion innovation –1) No regulatory obstacles currently exit in the US preventing prototyping of fusion reactors.2) You can freely and legally build fusion reactors in your home basement or at school without interference of any kind from NRC.3) You can legally buy high purity fusion fuels (D2O – which can be electrolyzed to 99.99% pure Deuterium) on e-Bay for less than $10.4) OPEN SOURCE design guides and plans can be freely downloaded on the internet for several good fusion reactor designs. Helpful Face book and Web Forum resources exits to permit sharing of fusion technical know-how and for group solving of problems with near real-time responses to difficulties.5) There are no defined reactor decommissioning costs for fusion reactor prototypes.POV - Is it really better to design reactors on paper, leave comments and post Blog articles and protest - or is it really better to just engineer and build the innovative power generation technology of the future?Engineers design and build things.Your chance of designing and building innovative ideas are much better in the fusion realm than in the fission area as a result of current over regulation of fission nuclear.------How close are we to nuclear fusion ? | NextBigFuture.com","2,201 followers",Iain McClatchie,668,411,2.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on","29,752 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet

So keeping it confined with powerful magnetic fields is the primary challenge.The problem is that plasma isFluid dynamics, the study of gases and liquids in motion, requires very powerful computers to model with fine enough detail to be useful. This is why supercomputers have proved so essential in fields like aerodynamic design and weather prediction.Now, try to imagine how challenging it is to model a fluid that experiences turbulence and convection and all the phenomena that gas does, but is moving far faster, is far hotter, and is simultaneously influenced by and creating electromagnetic fields and electric currents. The mind boggles.Still, progress is being made. Some very smart people are chipping away at understanding how fusion plasma works and how to control it, but as you can see, they have their work cut out for them.Edit: To elaborate a bit since this is getting views, the success of magnetic confinement fusion is often measured with a metric called the “triple product.” This is confinement time x density x temperature. All of these are of course important. Temperature and density both affect your power output; higher densities and temperatures yield more energy per cubic meter, which is important as far as getting more energy out than you put in.So, why am I focusing on confinement? Heating the plasma isn't difficult, it's keeping it hot (which means keeping the most energetic nucleii from wriggling through your confinement fields). And higher density also requires stronger confinement fields. So both density and temperature are contingent on keeping the plasma contained. Stability is more important than field strength, too: instabilities can build and overwhelm the strongest fields. Hence the importance of understanding the minutiae of magnetohydrodynamics, and the incredibly complex modeling and math required.Again, progress is being made. Confinement times used to be measured in fractions of a second, while today fusion plasma (not just plasma but plasma undergoing fusion) has been confined for over 100 seconds at a time.",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777.1K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-nuclear-fusion-power-mean-for-the-planet
