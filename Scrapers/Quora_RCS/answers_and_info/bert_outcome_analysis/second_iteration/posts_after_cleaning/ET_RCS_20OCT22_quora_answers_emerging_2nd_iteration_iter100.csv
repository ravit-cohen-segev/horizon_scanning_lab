Described by Sir Richard Branson as “underwear for superheroes,” Wireless Armour’s fabric is interwoven with a silver mesh, creating a shield against the relentless EM radiation onslaught of the modern age. Silver works especially well to integrate into underwear fabric for two reasons: it’s an excellent conductor of electricity, and blending silver and cotton creates a fabric that’s both strong and comfortable. Tests have shown that the fabric shields up to 99.97 percent of Wi-Fi signals. Silver also has the added bonus of being antimicrobial.Comfortable, stylish, and functional - your sperm will thank you.30 June, 2015Couples Are Being Paid to 'Test Out' New Condoms!Ever since the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s challenge announced a year and a half ago, scientists and designers have been collaborating to develop a “next generation condom.” They offered a $100,000 grant to any team with an idea for a condom that significantly improves upon the pleasure factor of condoms, in order to increase regular use. Condoms are only worn by about 5 percent of the male population. That’s pretty troubling, considering that when condoms are used correctly, they’re about 98 percent effective in preventing STDs. Developing countries are especially at risk, because an HIV diagnosis in those parts of the world remains a death sentence due to the high cost of antiretrovirals.So the following designers called upon couples to instigate as much bedroom research as they were able to for each design. Here are a few of the candidates:The yellow latex “Origami Internal Condom” created by ORIGAMI Condoms founder Danny Resnic. It’s designed to work alongside the mechanics of sex as an “active condom.” It moves alongside the body’s motion and actually creates a sensation on the inside of the condom.A hydrogel condom developed by a team from the University of Wollongong in Australia. Hydrogel as a material is purported to be a more durable latex alternative, and is engineered to feel and perform like real skin.Aravind Vijayaraghavan and a team from the University of Manchester plan to use nanomaterials to heighten sensation. It's made of elastomeric composite materials, to be specific – which should be able to increase natural sensations.A one-size-fits-all condom made from a composite material, developed by Benjamin Strutt and a team from Cambridge Design Partnership. The material is engineered to tighten ever so slightly during intercourse, which should both enhance sensation and increase reliability.A condom made from collagen (the main component in connective tissue) designed by Mark McGlothlin of Apex Medical Technologies Inc. Using collagen allows a hydrated skin-like exterior that permits transfer of heat to facilitate a more natural sensation.Mass-produced blood in a lab!

Military planes will soon be pilot-less.There's a lot of advantages to it, as advances in electronic sensors, communications technology, and guided weapons  have fundamentally transformed the nature of air combat.At the beginning, pilots relied on the human eye as the primary air-to-air sensor and machine guns and automatic canon as their primary weapons.  But the human eye can only spot an aircraft-sized target up to about 2 nautical miles in range, and aircraft cannon are only effective to less a nautical mile.The introduction of air-to-air radars and missiles transformed air combat beginning in the 1960s.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, short-range air-to-air missiles began to overtake guns as the dominate means for air-to-air kills, not just for the U.S. military but for foreign air forces as well.  During in the 1980s and 1990s, missiles that could operate beyond visual range overtook short-range missiles as the primary means for shooting down opposing aircraft.  This meant that the success of fighter pilots was no longer “linked to what they can physically see through the cockpit canopy, but what they glean from cockpit displays.”In other words, the days of Maverick and Goose in Top Gun having to maneuver behind an enemy MiG are long gone.  Air-to-air combat today is more like playing a video game, and engagements occur at distances so great that neither pilot ever sees the other.  Whereas speed, acceleration, and maneuverability were important in the gun and short-range missile eras, stealth, sensors, long-range weapons, and endurance are increasingly important in the beyond-visual-range era.  This raises the question: What is the advantage of having a person sitting in the cockpit looking at computer displays when that person could be sitting on the ground looking at the same information?Remotely piloted aircraft can match or exceed manned aircraft in many of the performance attributes of increasing importance for modern fighter jets, particularly when it comes to endurance.  Manned fighters are limited in how long they can stay in the air not by fuel (since they can be refueled in the air) but by how long the pilot can stay strapped into an ejection seat.  Unlike cargo planes and bombers, where the flight crew can get up, go to the bathroom, and even swap crew members mid-flight, fighter pilots can barely even stretch their legs in their tiny cockpits.  Remotely piloted aircraft, on the other hand, are not limited by the endurance of the pilot because they change out crew members as often as necessary.  And since remotely piloted aircraft can be refueled in the air, unmanned aircraft can stay in the air (and in the fight) until they run out of lubricants or need maintenance.Another reason the Navy’s next fighter jet is likely to be unmanned is that remotely piloted aircraft cost less over the long run.  To be clear, the aircraft themselves do not necessarily cost less, and in some cases they may actually cost more per plane to build and more per flying hour to operate than the equivalent manned aircraft.  The savings come from not having to fly them as often for training missions.  Fighter pilots need to be in the air to stay at peak readiness because flying a fighter jet, as Stillion has noted in another report, is like “simultaneously playing the piccolo, driving a formula-one race car, and bench pressing 200 pounds.”  Remotely piloted aircraft, in contrast, don’t need to be in the air to maintain pilot skills–simulator training is a realistic substitute for actual operations.There is more to the cost factor.
