We could also create solar panels on the Moon. It’s useful for fabricating electronics because of the hard vacuum. There are some processes you can do on the Moon easily which would be hard to do on Earth because it is so difficult to get a sufficiently hard vacuum to do them.There are several books by Moon enthusiasts describing this in detail, how it would work.I did a summary of some of the main resources on the Moon for my Case for Moon first. The rest of this answer consists of extracts from the sectionVOLATILE RESOURCESWe have pretty good evidence now of ice at the poles, in permanently shadowed craters, thought to beIt's not a direct detection however, so there is still room for scepticism about it, as rough material would have the same radar signature as radar transparent ice. But craters that are rough when new, are rough both inside and outside the crater rim. While these signatures are found only inside the craters and not outside the rims, which they interpret as meaning that they are caused by ice. The temperatures are also right for ice.If it is ice, it could be ""fluffy ice"".""We do not know the physical characteristics of this ice—solid, dense ice, or “fairy castle”—snow-like ice would have similar radar properties. In possible support of the latter, the low radar albedo and lower than typical CPR values for nonanomalous terrain near the polar craters are 0.2–0.3, somewhat lower than normal for the nonpolar highlands terrain of the Moon and are suggesting the presence of a low density, “fluffy” surface.""In either case, it is not just a little ice; if this is what they detected, there's estimated to be at leastIt also contains other volatiles. We know for sure that there is some ice on the Moon, by the LCROSS impact experiment. Relative to H2O at 100% they foundSo, if the rest of the ice at the poles has a similar constitution to the impact site that's a lot of nitrogen (in the ammonia) and CO2on the Moon at the poles.On the other hand, caution is needed as this is not direct detection. TheLEND mapThey did detect hydrogen, but puzzlingly, it was not correlated with the permanently shadowed regionsAThe Moon may also have ice at lower latitudes too, as there are permanently shaded regions up to 58 degrees from the poles (only 32 degrees from the equator). Though these regions are too warm to have ice on the surface, there may be ice there underground. SeeAt any rate, the Moon does seem to have resources of ice at the poles (though memorably, Patrick Moore in one of the last Sky at Night programs that he did said that he'd believe there is ice at the poles when someone brought him a glass of water from the Moon). More research is needed to find out how much there is and where it is.METALSCritics often say that the Moon is undifferentiated and doesn't have any processes to concentrate ores. Although the Moon doesn't have any liquid water so all the processes involving concentration of resources through water erosion won't work, it still has many processes that can concentrate ores. Including:The Moon has many valuable ores for metals. For instance, the highland regions (probably the original crust of th Moon) consists mainly of Anorthite (a form of feldspar, formula CaAl2Si2O8) which is 20% Aluminium, compared with 25% Aluminium for Bauxite on Earth. So aluminium ores are abundant on the Moon, indeed orders of magnitude more abundant than they are in typical asteroids, but it does require a lot of energy to extract the aluminium from the ore. Either a nuclear power plant or large areas of solar panels.""Aluminium (Al) is another potentially useful metal, with a concentration in lunar highland regoliths (typically10-18 wt%) that is orders of magnitude higher than occurs in likely asteroidal sources (i.e. ~1 wt% in carbonaceous and ordinary chondtites, and <0.01 wt% in iron meteorites; . It follows that, as for Ti, the Moon may become the preferred source for Al in cis-lunar space. Extraction of Al will require breaking down anorthitic plagioclase (CaAl2Si2O8), which is ubiquitous in the lunar highlands, but this will be energy intensive (e.g. via magma electrolysis or carbothermal reduction; Alternative, possibly less energy intensive, processes include the fluoridation process proposed by Landis , acid digestion of regolith to produce pure oxides followed by reduction of Al2O3 (Duke et al.), or a variant of the molten salt electrochemical process described by Schwandt et aMining this for the aluminium would create calcium as a byproduct, which is useful as a conductor in vacuum conditions, a better conductor than copper weight for weight -""Calcium metal is not used as a conductor on Earth simply because calcium burns spontaneously when it comes in contact with oxygen (much like the pure magnesium metal in camera flashbulbs). But in vacuum environments in space, calcium becomes attractive.""Calcium is a better electrical conductor than both aluminum and copper. Calcium's conductivity also holds up better against heating. A couple of figures mining engineer David Kuck pulled out of the scientific literature: ""At [20C, 68F], calcium will conduct 16.7% more electricity than aluminum, and at [100C, 212F] it will conduct 21.6% more electricity through one centimeter length and one gram mass of the respective metal."" Compared to copper, calcium will conduct two and a half times as much electricity at 20C, 68F, and 297% as much at 100C, 212F.""Like copper, calcium metal is easy to work with. It is easily shaped and molded, machined, extruded into wire, pressed, and hammered.""As would be expected of a highland element, calcium is lightweight, roughly half the density of aluminum. However, calcium is not a good construction material because it is not strong. Calcium also sublimes (evaporates) slowly in vacuum, so it may be necessary to coat calcium parts to prevent the calcium from slowly coating other important surfaces like mirrors. In fact, calcium is sometimes used to deoxidize some metal surfaces. Calcium doesn't melt until 845C (1553F).""Utilization of lunar materials will see the introduction of industrial applications of calcium metal in space.""From the section onThe Moon is deficient in copper, at least on the basis of what is known so far, but as well as calcium, aluminium is a good conductor.The LCROSS experiment found silver (a superb conductor) and mercury at the impact site, but the concentration is not known, except that it is far higher than the levels in the Apollo samples, and is probably in a layer below the surface, as the signal was delayed. SeeIt has abundant iron - in addition to ores (which would need a lot of power to extract), it actually has free iron metalIt's in powder form already, and naturally alloyed with nickel and cobalt. The blebs, or ""nanophase iron"" are found inside impact glass particles, so would be hard to extract. The rest though is made up of tiny particles of pure iron, so the obvious thing to try to do is to separate them out using powerful magnets. They are rather small though, most are less than a micron in diameter which could be a challenge. If we can separate them out, we can get five kilograms of iron, 300 grams of nickel and about half a gram of platinum, gold etc. (platinum group metals) in every cubic meter of regolith - as pure metal what's more. (This summarizes part ofHe bases that on aHowever we don't need to speculate any more as Jayashree Sridhar et al of the NASA Johnson Space Center have done the experiment using actual samples of lunar regolith. See""Experimental results indicate promise for the extraction of meteoritic metals from lunar regolith. However, more work is needed to refine the technique and understand more about the variables that affected our results.""The iron is valuable for steel, and is also a conductor, though not nearly as good as Aluminium or Calcium. It would be useful for some applications such as electric railroads on Mars, and is a conductor easy to access in the early stages.Also nickel and iron are useful for making nickel / iron batteries. These could be useful for making batteries on the Moon with in situ resources, for instance to help last through the lunar night.""Iron-nickel batteries are very rugged. Their lifetimes which can exceed 20 years are not affected by heat, cold or deep cycling. They are not easily damaged by rapid discharging or over-charging. On the downside, they have poor performance at low temperatures but they can be kept warm with insulation (e.g. simple regolith) and thermal wadis. Also, they only have a charge to discharge efficiency of 65% and will self discharge at the rate of 20% to 40% per month. Despite these shortcomings, they might be the Moon-made power storage systems of choice due to their simplicity and the availability of their component materials on the Moon. Moreover, these materials are among the easiest of materials to produce on the Moon.""Then, you also have titanium. This is especially interesting as it is rare in asteroids. Apollo 17 samples are 20% high purity Ilmenite, a Titanium ore which is found in the lunar mare. And better than that, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, with its spectral mapping of the Moon, discovered deposits that are up to 10% titanium, more than ten times higher than titanium ores on Earth. (Titanium is also widely used in medicine for hip replacements, dental implants, etc., asTitanium isCrawford writes (page 17)""Therefore, in the context of a future space economy, the Moon may have a significant advantage over asteroids as a source of Ti. The fact that oxygen is also produced as a result of Ti production from ilmenite could make combined Ti/O2 production one of the more economically attractive future industries on the Moon.For more on this, seeSo, yes, there are plenty of metals on the Moon, but it might take a lot of power to extract them, apart from the iron, if that can be separated out using magnets.And that's mainly based on the Apollo results which explored a small region of the lunar surface which has been found to be in some ways unrepresentative. The Moon may have many other surprises in store. Many ores on Earth would not be detected from orbit, and it seems the Moon has a fairly complex geology as well.As an example of one way the Moon could surprise us - Earth is often hit by iron meteorites, so the Moon should be also. The main question is, how Dennis Wingo has hypothesized in his Moonrush book, that the Moon may also have valuableTaking this further, there's a hypothesis by Wieczorek et al that magnetic anomalies on the Moon around the south pole Aitken basin may be from the remains of the metal core of a large 110 km diameter differentiated asteroid that hit the Moon to form the basin. If so, they could be useful sources for platinum, gold, etc.From Wieczorek et al, the North and South poles are marked N and S. Notice the magnetic anomalies clustered around part of the rim of the South Pole Aitken Basin. This is thought to be the result of an impact by a 110 km diameter asteroid. Wieczorek et al hypothesize that the magnetic anomalies trace out the remains of the metal core of this asteroid. If so these could be rich ores, including iron, nickel, also platinum and other platinum group metals (gold, rhodium etc). See page 16 of Crawford'sPlatinum is a particularly useful metal. It is heavy, soft, malleable as gold and silver, easy to draw into wires, very unreactive, and has a high melting point.The platinum group metals might be valuable enough to return to Earth from the Moon, just as suggested for the asteroids, especially if there is water to split and use as fuel available on the Moon or once they set up a mass driver on the MooOf course, you can't just take the current market value of platinum, multiply by the amount of platinum available in a large meteorite - or on the Moon if Wingo and Wieczorek et al are right - and conclude that you'd get trillions of dollars by returning all that platinum to Earth and selling it here. You need to fulfill a need or eventually nobody will buy it. If it's just to replace copper, for instance, in wires, it wouldn't be worth returning unless you could reduce the transport cost back to Earth right down. Dennis Wingo suggested in Moonrush that it could be worth exporting it to Earth for use for fuel cells, as an application that could be high value and yet need a lot of platinum.The gold could be useful too, on the Moon at least. You don't normally think of gold as more decorative than useful but it is used a fair bit in electronics Also combined with the abundant titanium on the Moon you get(density of titanium: 4.43 g/cc. using the atomic masses of gold and titanium, multiplying byThe paper focuses on its medical applications, you can alloy titanium with copper or silver, which are twice as hard as pure titanium, but this is four times as hard. It's also 70% more resistant to wear which will make it last longer and lead to less debris. And has excellent biocompatibility properties. But I wonder if it might also have lunar applications, with the hardness especially and resistance to wear.Probably only the platinum group metals would be worth returning to Earth, since it's going to be easier to mine the Near Earth Asteroids, especially the ones that consist almost entirely of pure metal. However, whether or not they are useful for Earth, they are well worth using on the lunar surface once you have industry there.The Moon has some advantages over Mars indeed for metals, such as the pure nanophase iron mixed in with the regolith, which can only exist in oxidized form on Mars except for rare metal meteorites. Also, it's unlikely it will be commercially worthwhile to return metals from Mars while there are definite possibilities of returning metals from the Moon. SeeLUNAR GLASSThis is a beneficial side effect of all the micrometeorite impacts on the Moon (which you don't get so much on Mars with its thin atmosphere, just enough to filter out micrometeorites). The Moon's ""soil"" or regolith contains large quantities of glass, created during the impacts. It also has free iron, as we saw, at half of one percent of the soil, in tiny micro beads of iron (nanophase iron) which concentrate the microwave energy. Again, you don't have this on Mars.As a result, it is really fast to melt the regolith using microwaves. It took only 30 seconds to melt small lunar sample at 250 watts (typical of a domestic microwave). You can melt the soil to glass as easily as you can boil water using the microwave in your kitchen. SeeHis idea (see Products from Microwave Processing of Lunar Soil on page 194 ofSee alsoThen, there's Behrokh Khoshnevis' idea for making a landing pad on the Moon using tiles made of lunar glass in situ. The idea is to make the surface into lots of tiles by injecting a material that can't be sintered easily using microwaves into the soil first to outline the edges of the tiles, then use microwaves to melt the soil in between.This would make a tiled flat surface for supply vessels to land on. It would also help with the problem of lunar dust by removing dust from the landing area. You canSOLAR CELLS FROM LUNAR MATERIALS - SOLAR PANEL PAVING ROBOTOnce you have glass, it might not be such a big step to make photovoltaic cells on the Moon. And here the Moon has one big advantage, the high grade vacuum so you could use vacuum deposition to make the cells in situ. To start with you'd make the cells themselves from materials sent from Earth, later on mine them on the Moon.This is a report from the Center for Advanced Materials at the University of Houston, suggesting the possibility of anIt would use silicon extracted from lunar materials to make the cells themselves. Of the various methods you could use, magma electrolysis may be best. He uses low efficiency silicon cells which are vacuum deposited on glass, something that is not easy to do on Earth but would be possible in the ultra high vacuum conditions on the Moon. Techy details of this suggestion areIt would requireIdea for a robot to drive over the surface of the Moon leaving solar panels in its wakeStructure of the panelsFor making glass on the Moon see the section above:BASALT (LIKE GLASS FIBER)The basalt itself is a natural resource. If reasonably pure and consistent in composition, it's ideal for making basalt fibre, which is like glass wool, but much better in some ways. The regolith consists mainly of powdered basalt. So might well be ideal for making basalt fibre. See:HELIUM 3I should mention this, since the topic is brought up so often in discussions of lunar settlement. However I don't see this as a major plus point for the Moon at present.The Moon is a source for helium 3, deposited in the regolith by the solar wind, andHowever, we don't yet have fusion power plants at all, and one able to use helium 3 is a tougher challenge. Frank Close wrote an article in 2007See alsoHowever if you use electrostatic confinement, a bit like a spherical cathode ray tube with the fusion happening at the center where the negatively charged ""virtual cathode"" is, then the particles are all at the same high energy and the result is much more feasible with lower power requirements. This is theGerald Kulcinski who has developed a small demonstration electrostatic 3He 3He reactor 10 cm in diameter. It is far from break-even at present, producing 1 milliwatt of power output for each kilowatt of input. SeePerhaps this line of development will come to something. Perhaps one way or another we will achieve helium 3 fusion as the enthusiasts for helium 3 mining on the Moon hope. However it is early days yet, and we can't yet depend on this based on a future technology that doesn't exist yet.However even if we do achieve helium 3 fusion, it might not be such a game changer for the lunar economy as you might think.Even more telling, he also calculates that covering a given area of the Moon with solar panels would generate as much energy in 7 years as you'd get from extracting all the Helium 3 from that region to a depth of three meters.Also - there are many other ideas being developed for nuclear fusion, such as laser fusion, and theThis doesn't mean that there is no point in helium 3 mining however. AsTHORIUM AND KREEP (POTASSIUM, PHOSPHORUS AND RARE EARTH ELEMENTS) ,AND SOME URANIUMThe MoonNuclear power stations built on the Moon wouldn't have the same pollution hazards and hazardous waste issues as stations on the Earth. Perhaps this may be a way to power space colonies, and interplanetary ships fueled from the Moon, so avoiding the need to launch nuclear power plants from Earth to orbit.Thorium is a tracer forWhen the Moon cooled down from the original molten state, then olivine and pyroxene crystals form first, and sink to the bottom of the magma ocean (both made of iron and/or magnesium plus silicon and oxygen). Meanwhile anorthite also forms (made of calcium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen), which is less dense and floats to the top (forming the lunar highlands). Some of the other elements like nickel are able to squeeze into the crystal lattice and get removed at the same time. But the larger elements can't, and are left in liquid state. They are last to solidify and form the KREEP deposits. It forms in between the olivine and pyroxene deep down, and the floating anorthite on top and may have been liquid for a long time.For some reason, not fully understood, then KREEP deposits on the surface of the Moon are concentrated on the near side of the Moon near the Imbrium basin, with a small amount also in a separate concentration on the far side. The Imbrium impactor probably excavated the KREEP deposits on the near side. But it's puzzling that the much larger Aitken basin didn't lead to large deposits on the far side. Perhaps for some reason KREEP is concentrated on the near side of the Moon. For more about this seeThe abundances of rare earth elements on the Moon are much less than rare earth ores on Earth, and despite the name, they aren't very rare here on Earth. So it's not likely that they'll be worth returning. However the most concentrated spots - the ones marked white in this figure - haven't been sampled on the surface and the spatial resolution is low, tens of kilometers. So it's possible we'll find more concentrated ores on the Moon.It's a similar situation for uranium and thorium. The abundances on the Moon from this map are too low to count even as a low grade ore on Earth. But with such low resolution, there could be richer ore deposits when we look at it closely. (Here I'm summarizing whatPOSSIBILITY OF USING LUNAR SOLAR POWER FOR EARTHThis is a bit further ahead, but it is worth thinking about, whether solar power for the Moon could actually be useful for Earth also. Some scientists think it could be.The advantage of doing this on the Moon is that you can use indigenous materials to make the solar panels. For a small amount of launch mass to the Moon you could have a rover that travels over the surface leaving solar panels in its wake. SeeIt's easy to see this working to supply power to the Moon, but some have suggested it could also be used to generate power on Earth. So, taking this even further, with a large scale operation of this type, using only 1% of the surface area of the Moon, you could supply 2 kilowatts of continuous power per person to a population of 10 billion on the Earth. SeeOr, further ahead, maybe this is more interesting as a talking point than a likely near future concept, the Japanese Shingzu corporation has suggested we could build solar panels in a band around the Moon - at the equatorSeeEarth would get solar power only half the day, so they send the power to satellites in orbit around Earth, which then beam it down to the other side of Earth. Of course they need large receivers to collect the power from the Moon, but only 1% of what they'd need to collect it directly from the sun - that could be worth doing if it is significantly easier to make solar panels on the Moon.On the other hand there are ideas to use large thin film solar panels in space or large thin film mirrors to concentrate the light onto solar panels or furnaces, launched from Earth to LEO. So would the lunar solar plants be a major saving compared to those?Another way that the Moon could help the Earth though, with solar power, is to make the solar cells from lunar materials, and then ship them to GEO or lower orbit. The idea of using lunar materials to make solar power satellites goes back at least to the 1970s, seeFor more on this see theWhether it is useful off planet depends a lot on how easy it is to export the materials from the Moon, and one of the most promising ways to do that is Hoyt’s cislunar tether system which exploits the Moon’s position as higher in the gravitational well than Earth to basically “roll the goods down hill” from the Moon to Earth through a system of rotating tethers.Seein my","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-viable-one-day-to-mine-the-Moon-and-extract-the-resources-there-for-something-useful
1,"They have engine too.Here’s a rundown of the kinds of technologies that NASA is looking at to propel the next generation of spacecraft through the cosmos, roughly running from least to most speculative.1. Chemical rocketsChemical rockets were the powerhouses of the space age. But after 90 years of development, further engine refinements aren’t expected to lead to major improvements in terms of thrust (these rockets are fundamentally limited by the energy held in chemical bonds).Litchfield argues that research in chemical rocketry should still constitute the major effort of NASA research, especThey have engine too.Here’s a rundown of the kinds of technologies that NASA is looking at to propel the next generation of spacecraft through the cosmos, roughly running from least to most speculative.1. Chemical rocketsChemical rockets were the powerhouses of the space age. But after 90 years of development, further engine refinements aren’t expected to lead to major improvements in terms of thrust (these rockets are fundamentally limited by the energy held in chemical bonds).Litchfield argues that research in chemical rocketry should still constitute the major effort of NASA research, especially towards generating fuel at the destination planet, rather than carrying it all on board. For example, those on Mars might split ice from the polar caps into hydrogen and oxygen to use as rocket fuel.2. ElectrothermalThese engines use electrical energy to create a super-heated plasma and fire it through a supersonic nozzle to generate thrust.These kinds of engines have been used in Russian satellites since the 1970s and by Lockheed Martin A2100 satellites, using hydrazine as fuel. These engines are efficient, but the thrust they generate is extremely low, meaning their only likely use will be to orient satellites in orbit.3. Ion driveNow we're getting to the futuristic stuff. The ion drive engine is a thruster where molecules of an unreactive fuel, such as xenon, are given a positive or negative charge (""ionised"") and accelerated by an electric field to be shot out the back.The thrust is incredibly low, equivalent to the pressure exerted by a sheet of paper on the palm of your hand, so an ion engine is very slow to pick up speed. But over a long-range mission, the it can deliver 10 times as much thrust per kilogram of fuel as a chemical rocket.The Dawn spaceprobe, currently in orbit around dwarf planet Ceres (and responsible for the first striking photos of mysterious bright spots), used its ion drive to become the first spacecraft to enter and leave the orbits of multiple celestial bodies.4. Solar sailsParticles of light (called photons) carry momentum, like ping pong balls bounding off a wall. The solar sail idea is catch enough of them to pick up significant thrust.A spacecraft with a large enough sail could eventually reach incredible speeds without carrying any fuel.The concept was proved in 2010 when Japan’s project Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun (IKAROS) unfurled a 196-square-metre sail on a mission to Venus.Last year, the LightSail project showed this design can work on a shoestring budget.But as a solar sail moves away from the Sun, sunlight becomes feebler, and the available thrust decreases. More ambitious designs imagine travel to the nearest stars by firing a massive laser to fill the sail to power it through interstellar doldrums.5. Plasma propulsion engineThese engines are like high-octane versions of the ion drive. Instead of a non-reactive fuel, magnetic currents and electrical potentials accelerate ions in plasma to generate thrust. It’s an idea half a century old, but it’s not yet made it to space.The most powerful plasma rocket in the world is currently the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR), being developed by the Ad Astra Rocket Company in Texas. Ad Astra calculates it could power a spacecraft to Mars in 39 days.6. Thermal fissionA conventional fission reactor could heat a propellant to extremely high temperatures to generate thrust.Though no nuclear thermal rocket has yet flown, the concept came close to fruition in the 1960s and 1970s, with several designs built and tested on the ground in the US.The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) was deemed ready for integration into a spacecraft, before the Nixon administration shelved the idea of sending people to Mars and decimated the project's funding.7. Continuous fusionFusion-powered rockets effectively try to recreate the power of the Sun by super-heating fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees until the atomic nuclei fuse, and generate even more energy.A fusion rocket would be hundreds of times more efficient than the best chemical rocket. But a continuous fusion enginer hinges on achieving a net output from a fusion reactor, something that several decades of research, and a few billion dollars of research funding, have so far failed to do.8. Pulsed fusionPerhaps a more achievable way to use fusion power is to control detonation of a miniature fusion bomb to power a craft.One design, being pursued at the University of Washington, works by dropping a pellet of two hydrogen isotopes, surrounded by metal rings made of lithium, into a combustion chamber.At the right moment, a huge magnetic field slams the metal rings closed around the pellet, compressing the fuel to incredible pressures, leading to fusion. It’s a bit like how your car engine uses controlled explosions of gasoline.A grain of sand of this fusion material would the same energy content as four litres of rocket fuel. But a major problem with this research is that actually testing one would likely violate nuclear test ban treaties.9. NanospacecraftMost of the strategies for deep space transport involve building bigger and more powerful engines. But what about shrinking the spacecraft instead?In 2009 researchers at the University of Michigan developed kind of nanoscale engine that could be patterned onto a silicon chip. It works a bit like a tiny particle accelerator, very high velocities using simple electric fields between charged plates. Each chip could contain millions of tiny electric launchers.10. AntimatterAnd here we are: at the very end of the feasibility spectrum into the fantastic. Antimatter is made of antiparticles, which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but opposite charge and spin.Antimatter also has the highest energy density of any known substance. And if used as fuel, it could provide by far the most efficient propulsion system, with up to 40% of the fuel’s mass energy being converted directly into thrust (compared with 1% for fusion, the next most efficient).In 2006 the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) funded a team Gerald Smith of Positronics Research, designing an antimatter-powered spaceship. They calculated just 10 thousandths of a gram of antimatter would be enough to send a ship to Mars in 45 days.The problem is generating enough fuel.Antimatter is created in particle accelerators, but if all of the antimatter ever created to date were annihilated at once, it wouldn’t be energetic enough to even boil a cup of tea.Unless a source of this superfuel is found, antimatter engines will likely always remain in the realm of science fiction.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1K,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-viable-one-day-to-mine-the-Moon-and-extract-the-resources-there-for-something-useful

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position).

In space there is no heat sink to tap, so all heat moving from the reactor must be removed using pure thermal radiation. As far as I know, all space reactors simply have large (very large!) metal cooling fins! These fins discharge the heat by radiating that heat into space.","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.1K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-viable-one-day-to-mine-the-Moon-and-extract-the-resources-there-for-something-useful

The environment hasn’t seem to have had much of a problem radiating that to space.The problem has been the accompanying CO2, which doesn’t escape because of gravity, and slows the radiation into space — hence “greenhouse” gases.Fusion wouldn’t contribute to the greenhouse, but might add to the heat input.","220,155 followers",Franklin Veaux,5K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-viable-one-day-to-mine-the-Moon-and-extract-the-resources-there-for-something-useful

Robotics would be able to deal with the decommissioning wastes since mass produced reactors would be very small by comparison to today's light water reactors (and with no large steam containment domes). These highly pressurized reactors that Alvin Weinberg warned us about still proves that we know how to handle the fission products waste. Yet they don't burn up the more serious “forever” wastes, leaving behind a radiation problem for thousands of generations.Molten salt closed cycle reactors would be vastly more efficient, safer and more responsible that today's behemoths. Yet they pose that one valid concern: can we trustAlvin Weinberg's molten salt reactor was proven safe at the demonstration level but oil loving politics (and people that hated the idea of a solution to the already known about global warming to come) simply cut the vital funding needed to go to the next level.~~~~~~~~Now we are left with the option that requires more raw materials and more energy: solar/battery. This is valid within the laws of physics, since Tesla and CATL and other clean energy industrialists are figuring out how to make batteries, specifically, the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) more efficiently. Note that sourcing, that is, mining the raw materials and manufacturing the actual clean energy parts from more localized locations fundamentally makes the process more efficient (I'm saying not just from China, to globalist eletes)! Solar already has achieved an Energy Returned On energy Invested of about ten. Wind, an EROI of twenty! That should be good enough to power exponential growth of itself (once kick started by fossil fuels) and of a still growing humanity.~~~~~~~~Nuclear fusion within the sun requires the unimaginable amount of gravity causing unimaginable amounts of pressure, at the core.

Current fusion reactors need more energy to stabilize the fusion reaction than you get out of the reactor.If we crack net positive fusion…Oh man. Sky’s the limit. A lot of problems become power problems if you have enough cheap power; that is, things we think of as social problems or resource problems or political problems are easily solved with massive amounts of cheap, non-polluting energy.Let’s take one trivial example: water.Modern wars are fought for oil. Future wars will be fought for clean water; in fact, we’re already starting to see that now.But cheap fusion power? Cheap power makes water an inexhaustible resource. We can make fresh water from seawater; we don’t often do so because it requires absolutely prodigious amounts of energy. Cheap, nonpolluting energy solves water resource problems.Transportation! Modern transportation relies on oil. If you buy a plane ticket, most of the money you spend on it goes, not to the plane, not to maintenance, not to staff, but to jet fuel.Small fusion reactors in aircraft can cut the cost of air travel into one-third to one-fifth what it is now. And that doesn’t even consider that a plane can haul more people if you don’t have to carry all that jet fuel!Lockheed Martin is spending money in fusion research for this exact reason.

12,"Cheap fusion power is thirty years off. Always has been, always will be.Said in jest, but unfortunately as true now as when it was first coined.I do not think the current torus-based fusion models will lead to commercial fusion. I think it is probably possible, but I think it will need a conceptual breakthrough to make it happen. However, there is no way to force that to occur. In the meantime, I think we need to keep attention on the subject, and plodding ahead with ITER is the only way we have, at the moment, to do it.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER.
