1,"There’s no big idea “after” social networks. There has always been social networks since the dawn of humankind, and they will exist so long as the human creature remains a social creature. The real question is what technology will power the next generation social network. I’ve spent the last 2 years with the Alfa Team on this question, and after researching the market thoroughly, we’ve concluded that the following paradigm shifts will push social networking to its next evolutionary milestone.There’s no big idea “after” social networks.

2,"IIoT is ""Industrial Internet Of Things.""As we all know IoT is booming in tne market. IIoT is just like triger and action. In IoT we just build apps and connect aur devices and share the data/information so this is just the trigger. But in IIoT we can do both trigger and action. In big industries and manufacturing plants IIoT can play a very important role where actions can be taken to solve the errors.In IIoT, companies can build sensors where these industries can gather the important data and take actions according to them.",UNKNOWN,Amarnath,13.1K,131,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-idea-after-social-networks-and-why-This-question-is-not-about-the-usability-of-the-social-networks

Moreover, the Industrial Internet of Things is the use of the IoT concept to increase manufacturing and other industry-related processes. Hence IIoT is now regarded as a subset of the Industry 4.0 concept. So let us go into the details of Industrial IoT.Technologies used in IIOT :In comparison to conventional IoT, there are other technologies that are used in IIoT.

5,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,257 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-idea-after-social-networks-and-why-This-question-is-not-about-the-usability-of-the-social-networks
