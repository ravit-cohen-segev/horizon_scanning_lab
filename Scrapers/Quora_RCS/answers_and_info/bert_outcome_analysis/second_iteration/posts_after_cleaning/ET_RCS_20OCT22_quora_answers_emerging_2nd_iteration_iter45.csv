0,"No. Cryptocurrencies have a bad carbon footprint ONLY when coal is used as a fuel to generate the electricity needed to run the mining farms. Smarter crypto miners are using solar, which has nearly a ZERO carbon footprint when running crypto mining farms.

1,"Whenever someone makes a general claim about the group who calls for one thing also calling for another and decries the hypocrisy, there is always room to question how much overlap there really is between the two groups and so whether there is even a discussion to be had about any hypocrisy.This example is one of the most extreme I've ever seen.

5,"After having watched Transcendence, I actually thought about this scenario. If there is a prolonged, large scale loss of power all across the globe, which means essentially that nobody has access to the internet after a couple of days because even the back-up generators which keep the net up have failed, then bitcoin will still exist, as will all other data, and one could theoretically trade it but what/how will you buy/sell offline?

If and when I do invest it is in blue-chip stocks which gives dividends. No stock is ever 100% safe, but there is a better chance with these stocks than others.Bottom line is very simple; trust yourself and invest in you, first. When you have extra, invest in Real Estate.You will have no regrets if you just grow a little bit every day as a person and a professional and help those around you do the same.By the way, Never Regret, you cannot bring back time.

9,"I bought many digital currencies years ago with people laughing around me. They advised me, that these were scams and I would not do well. I have done quite well, but obviously the market is in the dumps right now sitting at 300 billion market cap, which I expect to go to 1 trillion somewhere down the track. Do not ask me when!What you have to realize is that if you do daily research on these types of things, you will notice, crypto is going to be part of our future, and also ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and ROBOTICS so I am heavily investing in these sectors in 2018.

These have a bright future from the research I am conducting.Right now, these are solid areas to track and invest, but you must shift your mentality, that kicking yourself is not going to get you anywhere. You have investors who got in at the top of crypto last year, thinking it would go higher, and now they are in heavy losses, then you have people who got in early but get out too early.There is this ideology that as an investor, without too much knowledge you will always buy at the bottom and sell the exact top. Not only is this incorrect, but almost impossible.I am already seeing trends that larger institutes and pension funds, are already looking to invest in bitcoin and other smaller cryptos, like litecoin, ethereum and cheaper alt coins, but the regulation is not there yet for them to do this. Most retail investors see this a ‘get rich quick scheme’ and are greedy, thinking they can make millions overnight! This is not only incorrect, but the wrong approach altogether!.Cryptocurrencies are in caveman days as IRight now people are using rent money to make fast money on crypto. That is again a wrong ‘train of though’, The best advice I can give you is treat this like a longer term investment, and do your research on a digital coin that has real world use perhaps a top 20 coin, and invest for the long run, sayYou need to realize that there are lots of opportunities out there, that do not just mean investing in the current digital currency boom. We are on the cusp of the biggest technological boom the world has ever seen, so the opportunities coming, can make you very wealthy by many standards, the most difficult part is finding the right one that suits you and your personality, but first, realize that you need to change your mentality and thoughts. Once you shift your focus and follow your own intuition I am sure you will get the results you and your family desire.CBOE have recently filed the ETF for bitcoin, which when it gets accepted will allow investors to get exposure to this asset class even without buying it outright. This is huge news, and I would say the positive news comes “Late 2018” where the ETF does in fact get accepted.Please remember this is not financial advice, and I would advise you to keep researching week by week, for the best results.Happy investing, and GOOD LUCK!Please UPVOTE THIS & SHARE With Your Friends..Hope this helps. :-)","89,619 followers",Aviral Bhatnagar,521,832,34.9M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-hypocritical-that-generation-greta-screams-for-climate-change-initiatives-while-they-push-cryptocurrencies-and-gaming-which-have-the-worst-carbon-footprint-of-all
