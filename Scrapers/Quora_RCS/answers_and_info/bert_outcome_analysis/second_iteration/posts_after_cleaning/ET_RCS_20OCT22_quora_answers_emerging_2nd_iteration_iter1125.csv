1,"NO, China is very poor, and she can’t afford to have internet.Then you might be wondering how can I answer your question without internet?Because we have starbucks, McDonalds ect that are originally from other rich countries and they offer free internet, so what we do?We order starbucks and sit inside. Such a nice feeling to enjoy a drink while answering your question!",4 followers,Rachel Ren,2.8K,67,344.5K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Internet-of-Things-Internet-of-Everything-and-Internet-of-Anything
2,"Absolutely not, and whoever tells you otherwise is lying. The white and red-skinned traders who often come to our shores with their wooden contraptions that float on water have often brought with them tales of a great wonder known as the Internet. They claim it’s transported under the sea by a great serpent that they call the “Sea Cable” in their funny dialect that comes off the nose. They have also brought with them tales of flying hunks of metal, rafts made of steel, and small stone-like tablets that people use to communicate. Here, that would be considered witchcraft, and in the words of onAbsolutely not, and whoever tells you otherwise is lying.

Here, that would be considered witchcraft, and in the words of one of the greatest African Kings from the neighboring Wakanda kingdom, “No, We don't do that here”.Anyway, I digress. I would like to know more about this Internet you speak of. Does it fetch firewood? Can I use it to get myself a bride from the lakeside with a derriere from here to Timbuktu? (*see footnote) Does it walk, talk or breathe or is it a thing like a calabas? I've heard rumors that the Internet connects people from different lands and they don't have to travel so far to get water and sell their cattle. However, I choose to dispel these fork tales. You wonder why? See, these red-skinned people have been telling my folks and other people's folks that they need to close their eyes to connect with their god. However, people who did this found themselves closing their eyes and when they opened them, their land was gone. But they have also brought good stuff like more refined palm wine in gourds that one can see through. This means that Uncle Kamau with his banana wine drinking problem can no longer take big sips of wine from my gourd without me noticing because I can use my eyes to measure. So to answer your question, Kenya does not have Internet. Next time you come here, kindly bring me some.Since we use smoke signals and drums to communicate here, here's how you reach me. Just come all the way to the great junction of Makutano and when you're there, proceed North East till you pass the great plains of Mwea and when you start seeing hills, know that you're close to my home place. Find the tallest hill you can and light a fire. Release seven tufts of smoke, take a break, release another one tuft, beat your drum five times and then release five other tufts of smoke. That is my smoke signal code and anyone that sees it will know that you're looking for me and bring you to my humble village known as Difathas. Here they call me Don Difatha which when loosely translated to red skin language means, “Godfather of all the Fathers”.I will be waiting for more information about this Internet thing. I must educate my people.Footnote: The Timbuktu are our far away neighbors from the West. These guys can really travel long distances just to sell salt. That's why we Kenyanese actually love seasoning our food. It's unnecessary information but so was your question.",UNKNOWN,M.

3,"Not very much.First off, the Internet of Things is just built on top of the existing Internet. No new architecture. Zero. All that’s happening is that people are putting more computers inside of things that probably shouldn’t have computers and then putting them on the Internet. Do you REALLY need a processor in your fridge? In your toaster? In your stove? How is that a win?Second, remember that the S in IoT is for security.Wait, there’s no S in IoT.Exactly my point. All of the IoT devices that are about to become smart are about to become gigantic security problems.Have you noticed that yourNot very much.First off, the Internet of Things is just built on top of the existing Internet.

All of the IoT devices that are about to become smart are about to become gigantic security problems.Have you noticed that your laptop operating system vendor issues a security update about once a month? And that you have to upgrade and reboot your laptop?Well, guess what, your smart appliances are going to be in the exact same situation. There are going to be tons of security holes that are discovered over time. And are the vendors going to generate updates for their devices? So far, it’s really looking to be Not Good. I have a few smart devices already. I don’t see updates. Are other vendors going to be better about issuing updates and fixing bugs? It seems doubtful.What happens when everyone’s home has a thousand computers in it, all of which have some giant well-known vulnerabilities in them? That’s the distant future that we can foresee. Every house is part of a giant botnet. DDoS attacks with orders of magnitude more bandwidth than today. And we won’t even talk about the increased power consumption.Welcome to my nightmare: the Internet of Insecurity.","17,351 followers",Vint Cerf,1.6K,71,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Internet-of-Things-Internet-of-Everything-and-Internet-of-Anything
