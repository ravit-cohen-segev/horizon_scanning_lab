It’s also not finished, as you can see the covers are off the back two racks, and there is still a stack of packaging against the back wall.That’s about a quarter of a large one (you’re looking out from the center towards one corner). Yes, this is a Google cluster, and yes, it does count. It’s a different approach, but of similar performance to the research machines.Scale.That one is quite small as supercomputers go.

1,"Since bits mean doubling, two 32 bit processors would be a 33 bit processor, not a 64 bit one:)Actually, the trade off between multiple cores and bigger processors is very subtle, and for many applications two separate cores might well be better than one bigger one.It depends.",5 followers,Wasim Momin,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-supercomputer-different-from-a-personal-computer

Yes they of course cThere are many reasons that I've mentioned inFor the second question, you can't combine two 32-bit CPUs. Yes they of course can operate separately, so many parallel calculations can be done just like in multicore CPUs. Many servers and super computers work this way. But you cannot simply combine the results of those CPUs. Try adding two 20-digit numbers but split the first 10 digits to your friend and you do the calculations for the remaining 10 digits. Can you just concatenate the results into a new long number? Yes, but it's not the result of the other 20-digit addition anymore. That's what ""separately"" above means.","3,652 followers",Anthony Yeh,3.5K,392,4.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-need-a-64bit-processor-Would-it-be-possible-to-combine-two-32bit-CPUs

4,"China has some but not nearly enough. It’s been a question of whether or not they could lead a competing AGI project. It has been assumed that if AGI theory were published then everyone would want to build a prototype. The US could easily have two projects, probably two in Europe, one in Japan, and one in China. I think China could eventually get one working but it might take years longer than the US or European efforts.","284,817 followers",James Altucher,989,878,91.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-need-a-64bit-processor-Would-it-be-possible-to-combine-two-32bit-CPUs

10,"I’d think it was pretty common.I’ve seen plenty of developers who love Windows and do fine. I mean, especially if you’re a .NET developer, Microsoft is your stack.

Which leads to the second part of this question.Setting up a simple web server is kind of like configuring a cryptic system. You’re not worried about logic so much as, chmod permissions (Do you know why 777 is not such a lucky number?), chowning users and groups on appropriate files, apt getting… err…Anyways, what this means is that, unless they have some reason to suffer through making their own website or running a website for someone else… most developers have no reason to learn about setting up a server. You have web administrators for that kind of stuff. Sure, we’re advanced computer users, but that’s like telling a truck driver, “Hey, you work in a field with cars, don’t you know how to fix my transmission?” And the answer is… only if this proved relevant in their life until now. And even then, you’re probably looking for a mechanic, kind of how you’re looking for a graphic artist for your art, even though your developer might know a little photoshop, too.","3,954 followers",Andrew Lemke,1.9K,2.4K,7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-need-a-64bit-processor-Would-it-be-possible-to-combine-two-32bit-CPUs

15,"Contrary to what the Linux fanboys and the online open-source community want to believe, Linux is not anywhere close to ubiquitous. None of the operating systems based on it are particularly dominant. The vast majority of operating systems are in the embedded sector. They run everything from car ECUs to coffee machines, from fly-by-wire systems in aircraft to casino slot machines, from network routers to smart home appliances. They outnumber well-known desktop and server operating systems by several orders of magnitude. Windows is crushingly dominant on the desktop.

None of the operating systems based on it are particularly dominant. The vast majority of operating systems are in the embedded sector. They run everything from car ECUs to coffee machines, from fly-by-wire systems in aircraft to casino slot machines, from network routers to smart home appliances. They outnumber well-known desktop and server operating systems by several orders of magnitude. Windows is crushingly dominant on the desktop. The mobile space is shared between Apple’s iOS and Android (which is technically Linux, but is different enough to not really count for the purpose of this discussion). It runs on about 30–40% of servers, which is around the same as Windows; they have been oscillating around this mark for years. It should be noted that servers are vastly outnumbered by clients, so this is less relevant than it seems. The only place where Linux dominates is super computing, which is so niche an application that it is irrelevant here.Taking all this into account, there is no reason to expect any arbitrary software engineer to have worked on Linux, let alone be skilled with it. I happen to know someone who retired recently with around 40 years of industry experience. He has never worked on Linux and has never managed servers. Is he somehow deficient? No. He is exceedingly skilled. It is just that he has spent his career working on other things - embedded systems in the military and defense sectors, high-performance systems for scientific computing, hard real-time systems for industrial applications, and low-latency systems for media applications. He also wrote some Windows applications on the side. What use does he have for Linux?","82,155 followers",Quincy Larson,3.9K,358,29.1M,https://www.quora.com/Does-China-have-AI-expertise
