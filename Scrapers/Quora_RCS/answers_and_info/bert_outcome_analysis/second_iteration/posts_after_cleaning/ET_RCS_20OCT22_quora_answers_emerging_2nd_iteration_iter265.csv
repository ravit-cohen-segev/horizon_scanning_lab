1,"Well, everything that works “never worked” until it finally did. There’s clearly no reason to think that fusion is impossible (we do it regularly, not to mention the Sun), although there is a question of practicality.So investing in fusion development is no different than investing in any startup. It *might* result in something, and if it does, the payback is potentially huge. Or it might fail (as most startups do).

With such a rapid increase in worldwide energy use, there is certainly room for fusion technology investors to profit, Frequently omitted from discussion is the fact that there is currently in existence a practical working fusion technology that reliably produces more fusion energy out than the electrical energy the fusion experiment consumes.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Ivy-Mike achieved an engineering fusion energy gain factor Qe>100,000 (one hundred thousand times more fusion energy produced than the electrical energy required to trigger the fission-fusion device).All of the small fusion nuclear startups that are today actively designing and building fusion prototypes are long-shots (high risk - high reward) gambles. Fusion experiments are currently free of regulatory hindrance and obstruction, and the potential for rapid extreme profits for investors does exit if viable economical approaches to fusion can be identified.Modern fission-fusion is still the most reliable and proven way to produce fusion energy with energy gain. Pure fusion variations of the technology exist as paper designs (but do not yet exit as physically constructed, field tested products). Senior nuclear designers like LLNL’s Dr. Ralph Moir believe that fission-fusion technology has matured to the point that practical fission-fusion devices that produce 99% of their energy yield from fusion (and less than 1% of their energy yield from fission) are now possible.Many people today seem to believe that since existing tokamaks experiments like ITER are receiving the majority of worldwide fusion funding, they must be the best hope for ultimately producing commercial fusion. This is a questionable hypothesis at best, as ITER is already scaled to an impractically large size to compete head to head with existing fossil fuel and fission nuclear plants and tokamaks would in actuality have to be scaled many times larger than ITER for an actual commercial fusion reactor. MCF fusion today is consuming most of the world’s fusion R&D funding but just scaling this technology to larger and LARGER size to improve fusion gain factor and performance is unlikely to ultimately result in a competitive, reliable, commercial fusion power plants. No MCF device (tokamak or stellarator) in the last 60 years has ever, even for micro-seconds, produced more energy from fusion than it must draw as electrical power from the local power grid to make the magnetic fusion device operate. The claim that MCF tokamaks and stellarators should be considered fusion technology “front runners” is not really justified by six decades of actual experimental achievement with MCF technology.Given ITER and follow on DEMO tokamak Magnetic Confinement fusion technology, A MCF fusion reactor might well produce only one tenth as much power as a fission reactor of the same size.But merely producing a net positive power output is not enough; achieving a high enough power density is also crucial. Power density refers to the rate of energy production per unit of reactor volume. Fusion will almost certainly have a lower power density than fission and therefore will require a larger plant to produce the same output. Suppose a fusion plant had to be ten times as big and therefore likely ten times as costly — as a present-day fission plant to produce the same amount of power. Given the already intolerable costs of building fission power plants, that would hardly be economically feasible. These issues of producing net energy and achieving a high enough power density to achieve commercial competitiveness are dominant themes of the current fusion quest.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-investors-putting-millions-into-fusion-startups-when-economic-fusion-more-energy-out-than-energy-in-has-never-worked
3,"The environmental and safety characteristics of fusion power production offer the prospect of significant advantages over virtually all present major sources of energy.The basic fuels for fusion — deuterium and the lithium that is used to generate the tritium fuel—are plentifully available, and the fusion process would make no contributions to greenhouse gases or ocean acidification.The fusion fuel in the fusion chamber of an operating fusiion reactor at any given time is only a few grams.

Any abnormal behavior in the high-temperature plasma will inevitably cause rapid cooling of the plasma and quick termination of fusion process. Due to low fusion fuel inventory and requirement for stable confinement, there is no possibility of an uncontrolled large-scale fusion energy release. Moreover, the reaction products themselves are not radioactive (in contrast to fission).The above graph is a compoarison of fission and fusion in terms of radioactivity remaining in years following reactor shutdown (note log scale on Y axis that compresses visually the differences between fission and fusion in terms of production of radioactive waste and their endurance in the environment).The fusion neutrons induce radioactivity in the surrounding structure and tritium is a radioactive isotope. The amount and hazard of the resulting radioactivity strongly depends on the choice of material surrounding the fusion chamber. Proper choice of materials can result in minimization of activation products and tritium inventories[1].The radiological inventory in a fusion power plant can be much lower than that in an equivalent power fission reactor, and the time-integrated biological hazard potential can be lower byThe use of low-activation materials will also allow fusion components to be recycled or disposed of as low-level waste and not be a burden to future generations. The comparison of the decay of the radioactive inventory in a reference fission reactor and reference fusion power plants using low-activation wall materials is shown in the graph above. The graph shows the potential advantage of fusion power. After a period of 100 years, the radioactivity remaining from a fusion system can be millions of times less than that from fission. In the simplest terms, this translates into no need for the storage of waste over the geological time periods contemplated for repositories such as Yucca Mountain. In fact, the dose rates are small enough that some components can be directly recycled.Futher improvements that result in still yet cleaner forms of nuclear fusion can be expected to result from future innovations like -Falling Wall Molten Salt fusion chambers[2]Advanced fusion fuel cycles including He3-He3 anutronic fusion.He3 + He3 -> He4 + 2protons + 12.9 MeVHe3-He3 fusion uses totally non-radioactive fuel and produces totally non-radioative Helium as nuclear waste (and no neutrons - only easily shieldable protons that can be collected and directly produce electricity at very high efficiency exceeding the Carnot efficiency of any current thermal power plant)The combined requirements of He3-He3 ICF fusion is believed to be only about 40X the combined temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time requirements of DT fusion.

There will be experimental modules that use these neutrons to breed Tritium, to develop the breeder blanket technology to be used in future reactors such as DEMO and PROTO. These modules will need to use “neutron multipliers” to breed more than one atom of Tritium per neutron, as one atom of Tritium is consumed in producing each neutron and the goal in future reactors is to replace the Tritium as fast as it is consumed, and there will be some neutron losses (in irradiating the PFM for example). This neutron multiplier will produce still more nuclear waste.So there will be lots of nuclear waste, and as a result the earth will become a slightly more radioactive place.And unlike the extra radioactivity produced by fission reactors, this increase will never disappear completely.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Dr. Seifritz called his version of thermonuclear reactor HACER, a name perhaps intended to point out and emphasize the fact that his thermonuclear power plant included fusion production of hydrogen for transportation use as well as fusion produced electricity. Hydrogen production was a new feature for HACER and differentiated that power plant design from LANL and LLNL PACER fusion.Above is an artist's conception of a PACER fusion ""energy park ""which shows a large combustion cavern about 1 mile deep and 200 meters in diameter. A deuterium- deuterium fuel charge would be exploded here in the range of a 1 to 20 kiloton TNT yield. The cavity, filled with superheated steam, would absorb and quench the fusion fireball and act as a transport medium to carry thermal energy and by-products.Hacer: A Grand Design for Fusion Powerhttp://wlym.com/archive/fusion/fusion/19801111-fusion.pdfIn the 1950s, after development of the H-bomb, U.S. researchers at LANL and LLNL national laboratories developed a project known as Pacer, aimed at peaceful applications of nuclear explosions. The H- bomb, of course, is typically portrayed as ""uncontrolled"" release of fusion energy using a relatively small fission (A-bomb) trigger. What the Pacer project envisioned was the regular deto­nation of very small fusion bursts optimized for ultra-clean cost effective power generation in carefully designed, steam-filled caverns one mile underground, producing enormous amounts of electricity and, if desired, fissile material for startup of exceptionally clean operating fission reactors like Thorium Molten Salt Reactors or LFTRs.Most appealing about this approach presented by Dr. Seifritz is that there are only minor scientific and technical obstacles to the reali­zation of a Pacer-like power generating systems for harnessing fission-fusion and with only a few additional years of development, pure fusion energy. PACRER fission-fusion power plants could be undertaken immediately, on the basis of field proven existing technology and know-how, guaranteeing com­mercial fusion power within five years in a time frame that matters for solving worldwide climate and energy scarcity problemsWhy were PACER power plants, which would actually been 100X cleaner in terms of production of Minor Actinides and fission product high level nuclear waste, canceled by the Nixon Administration?President Nixon had made campaign promises to the American people to rein in federal spending, and the Nixon Administration searched for ways to trim spending. Leading edge nuclear fusion research, unfortunately, came to the attention of Nixon Administration budget managers and several visionary nuclear technologies then under development including Molten Salt Fission Reactors and PACER fusion were cut as President Nixon tried to keep his promise to the American people in reining in federal spending.In addition, environmental and ""nonproliferation"" arguments were put forward in Congress intending to force discontinuation of the Pacer projects at LANL and LLNL. These arguments, however, lacked technical validity.The underground mounted PACER reactor could be located far away from any community, operate very safely in a conservatively designed underground PACER cavern, and pose no nuclear haz­ards to populated areas of the globe while safely and sustainably producing ultra-clean DD fusion power used to produce commercial electricity.Dr. Ralph Moir led LLL efforts into producing PACER reactors in the mid-1970s.Modern versions of PACER would probably use pure fusion technology.A pure fusion peaceful nuclear explosive (PNE) optimized for ultra-clean power generation is a nuclear device design that does not need a fission ""primary"" to ignite fusion in a secondary stage but rather employs a pure fusion deuterium-tritium primary to ignite a pure deuterium power generating second stage.Pure fusion ICF devices produce small controlled bursts of fusion energy inside of 100 meter deep underground mounted evacuated mini-PACER cavity. When such a small fusion device is initiated inside its stainless steel cylindrical chamber, no shock and no sound is transmitted to the ground above.Vacuum will not permit transmission of sound.Vacuum will not permit transmission of shock.The mini-PACER device produces the Tritium it needs for the DT primary from Tritium produced via the D-D fusion reaction on the preceding shot. Tritium (190 milligrams) need only be supplied from an external source one time on the very first shot. All shots made in the mini-PACER reactor thereafter can be provided from Tritium bred in the reactor from residual Tritium scavenged from the fusion chamber debris left by previous D-D fusion shots. Thus Tritium supply is cheap and sustainable with the modern pure fusion form of PACER ICF; the vast majority of fusion energy produced by the mini-PACER reactor each shot is from cheap and ubiquitous Deuterium fuel separated from sea water.National governments have tended to respond with unreasonable fear to fusion reactor designs that produce power in short controlled fusion bursts. Much less technically mature and more difficult tokamak and stellarator reactors have for decades received funding preferentially over practical demonstrated ICF fusion approaches because they promised smooth power generation from extended continuous fusion burns as opposed to a series of many short, controlled fusion bursts. The reality is that tokamaks and stellarator fusion devices have not in 60 years attained burns producing any significant amount of power for more than a few seconds before the plasma confinement is lost and the fusion reaction stops.Reliable, repeatable, small controlled fusion bursts inside an evacuated chamber designed to safely contain all the radiation generated by fusion reactions is just as safe as the safest magnetic confinement continuous burn experiment. In all cases, the fusion reactions used are the same. Nuclear waste generated are in all cases also the same. Tiny mini-Mike fusion devices are harmless if stolen as they require large stationary lasers or ion beam particle accelerators to ignite them.Underground ICF pure fusion power generation is just as safe as the safest form of fusion that anyone has so far proposed and is a lot more rapidly implementable.Note 1: DOE during the cold war had a well funded and well led program to develop pure fusion experimental devices.(It 	may now be revealed)DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)(Point 3 may be disputed -Note 2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vast amounts of energy in uncontrolled manner is released causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclear fusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.The truth is that during the 1950s, fusion program managers wanting to develop fusion reactors like tokamaks and stellarators sought to dissociate themselves and their fusion technology (good) from thermonuclear fusion weapons technology (bad) which the public feared. The notion of controlled versus uncontrolled fusion was largely public relations and spin employed by AEC fusion program managers to enlist wider public support.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-investors-putting-millions-into-fusion-startups-when-economic-fusion-more-energy-out-than-energy-in-has-never-worked

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",55 followers,Jeff Suzuki,1.3K,4.4K,7.2M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-investors-putting-millions-into-fusion-startups-when-economic-fusion-more-energy-out-than-energy-in-has-never-worked
13,"As others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperaturAs others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperatures and pressures that are needed for fusion to take place.But very, very slowly and inefficiently. How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",385 followers,Bilal Ahmed,3.2K,96,2.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-clean-will-nuclear-fusion-be
14,There is a huge and reliable fusion reactor at our disposal. It is yellow and within the safe distance of ~140 million km. It provides the Earth with huge amount of energy.We just need to learn how to harvest and store it even more effectively and up to scale.There is a huge and reliable fusion reactor at our disposal.

I have no idea which of the dozens of fusion reactors Mr. Anonymous is referring to, but there are several running for a lot longer than milliseconds, and for a lot more than one time. They are not yet running continuously, nor commercially, but within a decade ….!Sorry, Todd, but what you are saying is misleading, if not downright false. You do not need “absolute zero temperatures for magnetic fields”. Most existing experimental fusion reactors today still use copper-based magnets and do not require such cooling. Although low-temperature super-conducting magnets do require near-absolute zero (+4°K), the use of HIGH-temperature super-conducting magnets, which can be used at liquid nitrogen temperatures (+77°K) is much more likely. The plasma temperature of 20–40 million degrees you mention is way off - it needs to be 100–150 million! But that problem, and the required separations, has long been solved.So, all in all, we’ve come a long way, baby, and we’ll get there soon!",475 followers,Noel Academia,839,246,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-clean-will-nuclear-fusion-be
