And it made me think even more about the issues.Eventually that period stopped, I concluded the sale, had to turn off the hardware and turn it over to the new owners. But I’d been part of the system and had discussions with others about “no really, how do we actually use this transactionally, for real?”I’ve been involved since. Largely as an investor, sometimes as tech advisor. It’s a super interesting space. I read recently that at about $213K per BTC, there’s enough value in BitCoin to replace the money supply of the US.Made me laugh. My long term target price is about $3M per BTC.Maybe it’ll get there. Maybe not.",841 followers,Henrietta Sydney,657,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-got-you-interested-in-cryptocurrency
1,"In 2011, I was investing in an incubator, a software technology incubator for small tech startups, to be exact.I was literlly cutting a check to help fund the launch when one of my partners, a brilliant software coder himself, offered that I should “invest some of that into a digital currency called Bitcoin while it’s still under $8 dollars and not all into this incubator.” I asked him to explain it to me. It sounded fascinating and like something I’d “really like to learn more about.” If I hadn’t already cut the check, or maybe if I had had a few more days to learn from him and read up then…In 2011, I was investing in an incubator, a software technology incubator for small tech startups, to be exact.I was literlly cutting a check to help fund the launch when one of my partners, a brilliant software coder himself, offered that I should “invest some of that into a digital currency called Bitcoin while it’s still under $8 dollars and not all into this incubator.” I asked him to explain it to me. It sounded fascinating and like something I’d “really like to learn more about.” If I hadn’t already cut the check, or maybe if I had had a few more days to learn from him and read up then… Well, the same old story goes, yada yada, (and yet the truth of it is).. had I invested that money into BTC that day instead, on Dec 17th 2017 that small investment would have been worth $49,948,000 untouched and left alone to simply sit.I couldn’t be happier than where I am in it now despite that, but more importantly how happy I am for my friend, the coder, who at the time was only 28 and had, with his wife, sold everything they could think of to buy more of it. And BUY they did. They started around the $3–4 price point and got all they could. The beauty of this is that he is as calm and earnest a computer programmer today as he was then still working 9–5 writing code for sharp startups with a wealth of retirement tied up in this digital currency.To answer your question, however, other than a friend and his advice, I got into it because I strongly believe in DLT, the technology, and how I truly believe it will improve the way future generations will live, exchange data, exchange property, and will transform a dozen other industries, not simply the financial. Now, what keeps me “invested” is something else, but you didn’t ask for that.Does this answer it? I will gladly accept pizzas delivered, but much prefer BTC donations to my bitcoin wallet and am happy to receive simple Upvotes.thanks, - nelson wells :)","55,749 followers",Loy Machedo,582,5.7K,66.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-got-you-interested-in-cryptocurrency

Replace occasional pieces of bedrock with “hardened stone” that can be broken by a special pickaxe found in the nether. Allow stone and ores to generate below bedrock.The region below bedrock still damages players. This is because it is inherently evil. The amount of damage is decreased from its present value in order to make short trips possible without shielding, but to stay very long players must add depth shielding to their armour by combining it with nether stars in an anvil. Depth shielding can also be gotten from a potion effect that you can get from enchanted golden apples or from a potion brewed using wither skeleton skulls.The “[username] fell out of the world” death message is replaced by “[username] delved too deep”Go sufficiently far down and you'll find special ores. Maybe a nether star ore or a multi-mineral ore. Or some new ores with new purposes. Emerald ore can generate in all biomes if you get far enough down.You'll also find increasingly powerful and horrifying monsters as you dig deeper. Some sort of stone-eating worm might be nice. Also, dragons guarding hoards of treasure would be cool. And zombies armed with pickaxes, intelligent enough to dig tunnels toward players. The silverfish spawn more here and are larger. Some mathematical function scales up both loot and monster difficulty as you delve deeper, so that you'll be motivated but even the most powerful, motivated players have to stop at some point significantly before the world border, say, by y=-100,000. This scaling difficulty provides a use for any overpowered items you add in later updates.You'll occasionally find underground villages below bedrock, with houses and streets carved out of the surrounding stone. Underground villagers have special trades. Because evil is common deep underground, they have found ways to dispel it, and underground priests will sell you enchanted books to remove curses. Underground blacksmiths will sell you an auto-timing mechanism that you can affix to your sword and it'll only swing when it's ready no matter how much you click. Maybe underground villagers should use a different currency, since minerals are more available to them deep underground. Some fraction of the underground villages you find are populated by evil villagers. This is more likely the deeper you dig, but doesn't reach the majority of villages before around 10,000 blocks down. Each evil village exists to guard a powerful evil thing (e.g., lich, necromancer, zombie monarch, buffed evoker) that's very hard to fight but drops a totem of undying.Mineshafts have cryptic, garbled notes in them from the people who dug them. Similar notes are found below bedrock next to small caches of supplies, becoming progressively less garbled until they can be fully read at y=-1000. Some notes have helpful advice. Some have frightening messages. Players can write fan theories about whether these are from a past race of players, or the endermen, or the villagers, or some unknown race originating deep underground.The deeper underground you dig, the more stone-based the terrain appears. Large caves get less common. Dirt and gravel generate less. Lava still generates, but not nearly as much as right above bedrock. However, the caves that exist show signs of life that's long been cut off from the surface. It's exactly as weird and scary as cave life and deep-sea fish are in our world.The addition of cubic chunks also grants more vertical freedom to builders and opens the door for a future update to add sky villages and better flight than the elytra for endgame players.Anyway, please let me know what you think. I get that this would probably frighten small children, but surface mobs do that too, and the game's developers seem to see peaceful mode as a good enough solution.",363 followers,Julius Rowe,688,2.3K,2.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-got-you-interested-in-cryptocurrency
5,"The Space Update:So if you go more than 500 blocks higher than bedrock, you enter space. It comes up with a sign and everything, like the nether. When in space you die from suffocation. But you can build spaceship blocks out of some red stone stuff and gold. You need five of the spaceship blocks in a plus form, and it becomes a space ship. You get in it, and can fly into space. It acts like a saddled horse. Once in space you can go to other planets with other areas and mobs. In space, UFO’s spawn.

They also attack space civilizations and villages. They blow them up. So many planets, so many new possibilities!EDIT:Lots of comments have been saying that this update will make Minecraft require bigger clunkier computers or just result in PC crashes. That’s a good point that I never really thought about. I will keep the original, because some people like that idea, but I am adding a different update as well. OK, enough explanation, lets get into my second attempt of an update:The Mobs Update:This update will be mainly focused on mobs as the name implies. It will tweak little things about existing mobs, and add new ones.New Mobs:Goblins:They will probably look something like this. They will be a passive mobs, so they won’t attack you. They have the speed of a baby zombie and half the health. Goblins will be thieves. They can open doors and chests. They are attracted to gems. Storing gems in a chest will attract nearby goblins who will steal them. The only way to get your gems back is to kill that specific goblin. When a goblin is killed it will drop XP, 1 piece of rotten flesh, one iron ingot and all the gems it has stolen in its lifetime.Pigmen:See here:Yeti:The Yeti will be a hostile mob that can only survive in cold regions. They deal huge damage. There is a one in 100 chance that a yeti will spawn outside the cold region. This transforms it into a bigfoot, which is basically the same, but can’t go in cold areas.The Kraken:The kraken would spawn in the oceans, and be like a squid, but red and bigger and hostile!Orc:My Minecraft update would add underground villages, where no villagers spawn, only orcs! Orcs will kill sheep and zombies on sight and are neutral when underground in their villages, but when they come above ground at night or when it rains, they become hostile.Worm:The worm is a peaceful mob, and can be found in caves or above ground when it rains. Drops pink dye.Rat:Rats are fast mobs that spawn in caves. They are aggressive, and being bitten by one will poison you. Food is the only cure. One hit from an iron sword will kill it. Can be tamed using cheese.Troll:Trolls will live underground in caves. In my update, treasure chests would spawn underground, and are always accompanied by a troll. They are hostile. Never leave caves and are turned into stone trolls by sunlight.Stone Troll:A variation of a troll, can be created by a troll going into sunlight, or a one in 50 chance of a troll spawning in sunlight. These beasts are twice as slow as a regular troll, but have three times the health. They eat coal and are hostile.Fire Troll:Another troll variant, spawns naturally in the Nether, and can be created by lighting a regular troll on fire. They are the same as regular trolls, but they are fire proof, and hurl explosive fireballs.Forest Troll:These trolls carry wooden swords, spawn in forests and are twice as tall and half as wide as a regular troll. Hostile. If lit on fire they become a charred troll which is basically the same, but black.Ogre:The trolls smaller cousin, spawns in swamps and is hostile.WerewolfIn the day they are regular wolves and can be tamed, but come night, they transform into terrifying beasts, and will kill the player, even if they have been tamed.Werecat:Same as werewolves, but are cats.Black Changeling:These creatures are hostile, and disguise themselves as animals. When players come near, they transform into their true form and attack. There are three thing that are warning signs that animals are changelings:White Changeling:I included a picture of a skeleton, because in their true form, they look like skeletons, but without the bow, and have no holes in their bodies. They can transform into villagers. Much rarer then Black Changelings, these mobs are far more dangerous, with higher speed, health and attack damage, and take the form of villagers. Their only giveaway is blue eyes, and other villagers will not intentionally leave them alone.Ants:A neutral mob that builds ant nests. I f you stand on the ants nest, the ants will bite you, and destroying the whole nest will kill all the ants.Bees:Just like ants, but make their hives in trees and can fly. Standing below the hive will cause bees to attack you.Raptor:These mobs will spawn in deserts, have low health and are super fast.Griffin:These will spawn on sky islands and are neutral. Very hard to kill, and drop gold ingots when killed, just because.Kangaroo:Spawn in mostly in red deserts, but are also common in grassland and regular deserts. Drop kangaroo meat when killed, and are peaceful. Can be ridden.So that’s all the new mobs. But some other updates to pre-existing mobs include:And nothing else. Add in sky island. Hope you liked this update. Tell me if you think it was better or worse than the space update in the comments below. See ya’!OK, so I promised you that if I can get 600 up votes, I would add more stuff to this answer. And so I shall:Introducing…The Underground Update:Yes, I know many people have done this before, but most of them have been centered around caves and mining, so now I can do both in the Underground update! So now I will present it to you:Added biomes:Underground villages (see here:Chrystal Caves:These caves will feature tall Chrystal spikes, protruding from the ground, made of blocks of diamond, emerald, lapis lazuli, and other gemstones added in the update. Any mob within this cave will immediately become peaceful. They will also have glowing mushrooms in them, as seen in the picture below:Mushroom Caves:These caves would be filled with all types of mushrooms, from glowing ones, to brown ones to red ones and mushrooms that would have just been added in this update.Added structures:Cave Temples:Shrine like temples, found in caves, feature chests that will hold mostly gold and diamond mining tools, but have a 10 percent chance of holding diamonds. They will be rare. They will be surrounded by a variant of goblin known as a worshiper. Entering the shrine will prompt them to attack you. Luckily, there will only be five at one shrine.Scavenger Outpost:Small, stone structures, that are populated by the scavenger variant goblin. They contain chests, which normally hold treasure and weapons. Scavenger goblins are hostile, and will attack you once you come within 10 blocks of them. They are fast, and attack with wooden swords. It would look like the image below, but made with stone.Dwarf Strongholds:These buildings would be found just beneath the ground, made of 3 layers of cobblestone, they would have three rooms. They would be found in the center of caves, and have one door at the front and one at the back, and have two stories, with stairs leading to them. Inside would be dwarves, a peaceful mob and be filled with mining tools. Skeletons, spiders, goblins and zombies would be attracted to these strong holds, and if one is spotted, the dwarves will rally and destroy it. It would be a larger, more fortified, underground version of the image below.High Goblin Palace:These palaces are huge underground structures, populated by high goblins, a goblin variant that is hostile and wears armour and carry's pickaxes. Because they are so tall, the will only appear in massive caves that will spawn with them. The tops of these palaces will poke out of the ground. They will be filled with treasure and there will be three in every world. Every so often a dwarf troop will attack the palace and attempt to steal its treasure. Once two thirds of the dwarf army has been killed, they will retreat to the nearest dwarf stronghold. Armies have about 20 troops in them.Added mobs:GoblinsHigh GoblinsScavenger GoblinsDwarvesChrystal Spiders: Inhabit Chrystal caves, remain hostile when in the caves. Drop rubies when killed.Giant Bats: Huge bats that spawn deep underground. Hostile.Cave Skeletons (stone skeletons)Cave PigsBulls (like cows, but charge if hit instead of run away)Added blocks:Ruby (can be traded with dwarves and villagers.)Topaz (can be traded with village goblins, which will stop them from attacking you.)LimestoneOpal (function the same as rubies)Mushrooms:Glowing mushroomsParasitic mushrooms: If an animal eats a Parasitic Mushroom, it becomes infected. This makes it hostile and mushrooms grow out of its back. If you eat it, you become sick.Gas-Shrooms: These mushrooms have a blue haze around them, which causes you to loose half a heart if you stay in it for two seconds.Death-Shrooms: These mushrooms spawn zombies at night.Tools:Dwarven Hammer (like a pick axe, but more effective than a stone pick axe, but never breaks)Ruby Pick: Harder to destroy then a gold one, but just as powerful.Obsidian Pick (only as good as a wooden pick, but never breaks)Other updates:Pigs, cows, sheep, cave pigs and spiders eat mushrooms.Graphics are upgraded.Skeletons attack damage is lessened.Vertical rails and diagonally placed fences.Hope you like it! :)My final update. Maybe. I don’t know. I feel kind of intense, like this is the something super important. Anyway, introducing:The Travel Update!I’ve expanded Minecraft in the Space Update. I’ve added more monsters than ever before in the mobs update. I gave players a more interesting underground in the underground update. What more is there to do? Well, I’ve decided to update the way players travel Minecraft.Caravans:To build a caravan, you must first make a bunch of stuff. First, four wheels, which are made out of 14 sticks, four more pieces of wood and two pieces of lead. First, you build your caravan and place it on a saddled horse. The caravan appears behind it. A caravan has wheels which allow it to travel. Just above the wheel, is a floor made of wooden planks. It is four by four. You can place anything you want on these blocks, like chests and beds. You can then ride the horse. Wherever you ride, the caravan will trundle along behind you, allowing you to take your home and materials anywhere.Backpacks:Made out of then pieces of string, you where a backpack like you where armour, but when it is on, you cannot put of a breastplate. A backpack allows you to carry ten more items than usual.Elephants and Mammoths:Elephants an mammoths are basically the same thing, but elephants spawn in snow biomes and elephants in savanna. They can be saddled and ridden, but once saddled, they can do many more things like:Construction: Once saddled, you just teleport on top of it, and you can build on it. You can construct things like towers on top of the elephant or mammoth. You can then control it by placing a red stone block on top of its head. You then place a wheel on it, and then build on the wheel without anything in your hand, you can then move it around.War Horses:These are horses that have war saddles on them war saddles are created when combing a saddle with a crossbow. When being ridden, the crossbows on either side of the saddle will fire at any nearby hostile mobs, except for vindicators.Blimps:It’s a hot air balloon, but I’m calling it a blimp. It is built out of ten pieces of wool and five sticks. Once you hop in, you have complete control, and you must hold jump to go up. It is one of the safest ways you can get to the newly added sky islands. Once you hop out, it will return to the nearest piece of ground below it, and it will stay there.Grappling Hook:Crafted out of an iron pick axe and a crossbow, a grappling hook is an efficient means of travel. You aim like a cross bow, and your pick axe will fly out, and the first block it hits, you will be drawn quickly to, unless you discard the grappling hook. They can be crafted into a weaponized grappling hook, which is made by adding a sword to a pre-made grappling hook., which will not stop until it reaches a solid block, and will take 20 health to any mob it passes throughJetpacks:Crafted from three redstone dust, one redstone block, two fireworks, two gold ingots and one stone block. It is placed like a breastplate, but if you put it on you can’t wear a backpack or a breastplate. It allows you to fly as if you’re in creative.Teleporter:Teleporters can be built. You need one gold block, with one clear glass block on top, with one redstone block on top,with a beacon on top, with a piece of red glass on top. If you switch on the lever on one side, both teleporters will turn on. If you step into a teleporter a map of every teleporter in a 1,000 block radius will be shown to you, you select one, and you come out at that teleporter.Sky Beam:If you create a beacon and place a beacon on top of it, it will become a sky beam. Standing on top of this beam will lift you up into the sky, at a rate of five blocks per second.Village Turtles:These turtles wander the land slowly, climbing over every obstacle. They are huge, and carry villages on their backs. These villages have villagers on them and will never leave the turtle no matter what. Only three of these creatures will spawn in the whole world, but an egg for one can be found at the center of one of the three of these villages and in a turtle temple in the ground just above bedrock.Hope you liked my last update. Thanks for all your support. I’m so glad you all liked it. Adios.OK, so, as it turns out, I’ve gone all Disney on myself. I want to add more to this answer. So, here we are again, for our next big update.The (pause for dramatic effect) Swamp Update!Yes, you heard me. It would be, and you’ll never guess this, an update, centered around swamps!New Mobs:So, I will add the Druid.Druids will guard Druid camps (three at each) and will only appear when a player enters the camp. When killed, they drop black cloth and a druid totem (more on that soon). Their main attack is a magical blast, which does damage to the player, and can do an Evoker stance and entangle the player in vines.GypsyThe Gypsy will inhabit caravans, which can be found in swamps. The gypsy is a peaceful mob, but, if attacked, it will blast you with magic. If hit, you will be transported back to your spawn point, and a sleepless effect will be activated, preventing you from sleeping for two nights. In their cabins, they have Chrystal balls, which, if you hold it in your hand, will allow you to see all mobs in the area, even if they are obscured by an object.Bullforgs:Massive frogs, that just sit around, and hop away when hit. If the player walks in front of them, however, they will shoot out their tongue and it will latch on and drag the player in. If you hit the bullfrog, it will release you. If not, half your health is gone.Next up, we have Crocodiles!Spawn in swamps, crocodiles will swim around in water, until a player or a cow comes by. If the player/cow goes in the water, the crocodile will attack it. If not, it will leap out of the water and attack it. It can only go five blocks away from the water. If there is a waterway that connects the swamp to the sea, it has a chance of swimming up it and out to sea, becoming a salt water crocodile, which simply means it will deal more attack damage.Now onto leeches! Looks like an all black endermite, and like a silver fish, will chase after you. If it gets onto you, you will have a bloodsucker effect, that slowly deteriorates your health for one minute.Snapping Turtles also hit in the water and bite players who enter the water.There will be some more new mobs soon, but now, I’m going to move onto the biggest part of the swamp update. A new dimension. In witch huts, the chests will now contain 20 witch dust, which is basically red-stone dust. Make a four by four square on the ground and place a druid totem anywhere inside (see, told you so), and it will create a portal. Step into the portal, and you enter The Corrupted.A swamp themed dimension, once a place of beauty and magic, but taken over by witches and druids, as well as the evil sporeshrooms, populated by Deadwood Trees.Bunyips swim in its dark waterways, attacking any play who dares to enter the water. Huge lily-pads float on top of the water but will give you slowness if you stand on them for two seconds.Swamp hags roam freely around, giving hunger effect if they hit you. And they will hit you. Ancient castles tower over the landscape. These once majestic buildings are now overrun with witches an swamp hags. Dominating the landscape are corpse flowers, which will deal damage if you get to close. There are also sporeshrooms, which act a spawners for Infectors:Skeleton archers that fire infection arrows at players. If hit, an infected effect will activate, and it will last five minutes. If you die within that time, in the place that you die, a sporeshroom will grow. It will take some time to become fully grown. If you die in a different dimension, they need to grow on Mycelium for it to reach full size.Infested are another mob that spawns in the corrupted. When they die they also plant a sporeshroom. They are basically the Corrupted’s zombies.Also have a small chance of spawning from Sporeshrooms.There are also the Abandoned.The Abandoned are four armed, green eyed Endermen, abandoned long ago in the Corrupted. Will attack both players and other Endermen on sightThe Corrupted portals will not allow mobs through, so they can not migrate into the Overworld.Witches also have black cats with them.Combining a bucket of water with a dirt block will create a mud bucket, which is way thicker than both water and lava. If combined with lava, it will become hard baked mud, which can be used to make mud golem’s, and mud bricks.Oops, almost forgot the crown jewel of the Corrupted: The Boglins!Ride around the corrupted in canoes, which can seat two players and four Boglins. If they see a player, they will anchor the boat (which is a new feature that always comes with canoes and can be added to normal boats) which will keep it in place, and attack. If they kill a player, everything that the player had will be taken. The only way to get it back, is to find and kill a Boglin Chief, who hides within a Boglin camp, filled with defence Boglins. If you kill the chief, all your stuff will be dropped with him, and their looting effect will be deactivated. Boglins and Boglin Chief’s drop Boglin Hearts, which, when fed to a Marsh Crystal, can set your spawn point in that place.......EDIT 1:Wow! So many comments and up votes even before I added the mobs update! Thanks so much!EDIT 2:Oh my gosh! This answer is the most popular in this question. Thank you so much everyone. I really appreciate it! If I can get to 600 up votes, I’ll add some more stuff to the answer.EDIT 3:Thank you do much for all the upvotes. If I can get to 700, I’ll add another thing.

Takes about 30 seconds to mine a block of bedrock and 3 seconds to mine a block of obsidian.Bedrock and Black Stained Glass can make the singularity sphere shown below:To make a singularity, you must use a dragon egg and put it in the center of the sphere. The dragon egg will be able to open and you will be able to put an infinite amount of items in it. However, anything put inside will be lost forever. Putting 2304 items inside will result in a singularity.Once the singularity is created, it will immediately have a gravitational effect on surrounding terrain, dragging it inwards and destroying the sphere as well as making the singularity evaporate, blowing a giant crater in the land.This can be useful for destruction, but it is not the main purpose of the singularity. To halt the effects of gravitational pull, you can use an Anti-gravity Generator and put it anywhere on the sphere to create an anti-gravity field around it.Once the Anti-gravity field has formed around the singularity, a black hole will spawn inside the sphere. Using an Ender Table, you can craft bedrock armor which will allow you to safely enter the black hole.Upon entering, you will find yourself in the reverse realm, where blocks and mobs are random. More valuable/tough blocks and mobs will be rarer. In the sky, planetoids made of one kind of block will be floating above the ground. They will have their own gravity. Upon reaching the center of the planetoid, you will come across a chest. This chest will contain one of everything that can be crafted or smelted from the planetoid block type. If nothing can be crafted/smelted, the chest will be filled with that block.The Reverse Realm is about the same size as the Nether. In the center, you will find a planetoid full of dense neutron matter: a neutron star. Breaking it will blow the whole thing up and spawn the Gamma Ghost. The Gamma Ghost will shoot lasers that bounce everywhere until they hit you. Being hit will deal 5 normal damage (2.5 hearts). You can use a shield to deflect the lasers. The Gamma Ghost can summon Vexes and Strays. It also occasionally summons Ghasts. Arrows and Tridents will bounce off the ghost’s force field and melee damage will only damage the attacker. Piercing arrows and Tridents can hurt the ghost, but not by much. Eventually, the ghost will fire a huge beam of Gamma Rays which will sweep the level above the ground. The beam will destroy any entity it touches and light blocks on fire. The beam can be reflected with a mirror shield back at the ghost which will bring down its force field.The Ghost will be vulnerable for 15 seconds, so deal as much damage as you can. You can use a Stellar Bladeto maximize damage (15 damage per hit)The Ghost has 400 (❤️ × 200) health on Easy, 600 (❤️ × 300) health on Normal, and 800 (❤️ × 400) health on Hard.Other attacks include:After you defeat the boss, it drops a Strange Sphere and it summons a stable Black Hole to return to the overworld.The Strange Sphere can be used indefinitely in place of the Lapis on the Enchantment Table and can give tools and armor Stange Enchantments:The Strange Orb can be infinitely used, however enchanting something with it comes with a price of 50 levels (Magnet, Chain, Moisturizing, and Cursed Spells will cost only 30). Strange enchanted items will have a green tag.The Gamma Ghost can be resummoned by putting the Sphere inside a Beacon in the center of the Reverse Realm (marked by a beacon beam). The Sphere can be recovered after this, but the beacon will break and drop a Nether Star and the Strange Sphere. The Neutron Star will reform allowing the player to fight the ghost again.Alien Invasion:After you defeat the Ender Dragon, a computer bug might sometimes spawn. It is twice as rare as an illager patrol and is passive.It will go up to you and stare at you for a few seconds. It will then leave. It is completely passive and has only 1 health. It will also avoid water. However, if you kill it or jump on it, it will die and an alien invasion will occur. You can kill it safely by pouring water on it.Once an alien invasion happens, a bar that says alien invasion will come up on the top of the screen. Tractor beams will also descend from the sky and abduct animals (mostly cows). After 30 seconds of this, aliens will start to descend the beams. There are 5 waves of aliens on Easy, 7 waves on Normal, and 10 waves on hard. There are different types of aliens.On Wave 10, all other enemies except for the Alien Spaceship will stop spawning unless beamed down by the spaceship.Power crystals can be used as fuel in furnaces, blast furnaces, and smokers. They will last indefinitely. The flame in the furnace interface and the block will turn green and you can mine it, pick it up, and place it without wasting the fuel. Furnaces, Blast furnaces, and smokers will become Power furnaces/blast furnaces/smokers.Holo-bars can be used to craft things stronger than diamond. They also use blaze rods instead of sticks.Space Sword:Space Gun:Space tools:Space Armor:[images]Space Spear:Shield FieldSpace fabric can also be used for different things.Moon MapThis map will move as you move, always placing you in the center and moving the map around you. There will also be a red line between you and your initial spawn point and a green line between you and your spawn point on the map.Teleport PadThis pad will allow you to teleport from one place to another when linked with another pad. You can create pad channels up to 999 allowing you to connect pads of the same channel.Cosmic StringThe Cosmic String can be used to create the lava rod which can be used to fish in lava.Lava fishing:Fish (84%):Lava Trout: If eaten, you will catch fire. They can be used to create a bubble potion, which creates a 3x3 area of air around your head in water. This bubble can be used for breathing and walking underwater normally.Obsidian Angler: If eaten, you will have fire resistance for 30 seconds. You will also be able to swim in lava.Witherfin: If eaten, you will have the wither effect for 10 seconds. Can be used to make potions of decay.Starfish: Eating will deal instant damage. Can be used to make thorns potion.Junk (10%):Iron nuggetsGold nuggetsBlaze rodsMagma CreamGhast TearsCoalRotten FleshNether WartTreasure (5%):Enchanted booksDiamondsHorse ArmorGolden AppleSpongeSecret (1%):Molten CoreThe molten core is a rare item you can get out of lava fishing. Crafting it with 2 diamonds and 6 iron will give you the Nether Reactor Core. This item can be placed with a structure around it to activate it.Attempting to activate the core without the correct structure will result in the message ""Not the correct pattern!"". Once the block is activated with the correct structure, the message ""Active!"" would appear. The sun would suddenly set quickly and change the time to night. Around the Nether Reactor, a Nether Spire will generate, producing extremely rare items.Such items include diamonds, emeralds, ender pearls, golden apples, sea lanterns, seeds, quartz, glowstone, cactus, sugarcane, and ice. The reactor will also turn into glowing obsidian and the core will turn red. Zombie Pigmen will start to spawn in the spire. 45 seconds after the reaction, items will stop spawning, the reactor will turn into obsidian, and the core will turn dark blue. You can harvest the dead core with a Silk Touch pickaxe.Now for the finale:If you get a crafting table, you can craft a legend orb by crafting a Totem of Undying, a Dragon Egg, a Nether Star, a Strange Sphere, a Dead Reactor Core, a Guardian's Eye (dropped by elder guardian), a Conduit, and a Power Crystal in any formation, with a Diamond Hoe in the middle.You can use the Legend Orb and surround it with 8 Holo-Bars to create the Attackanizer core. You can surround the Attackanizer core with Diamond Blocks to create the Attackanizer.The Attackanizer is a giant mech that stands still when you dismount and can only be ridden by you. When you ride in it, you can use lots of different weapons. You can arm it with TNT, arrows, beam pellets, music discs, and swords.When you mount it, your inventory will be replaced with TNT, an arrow shooter, a ray gun, and a blade (it will tell you how much you have left. If you have 0, the item will go dark). You can put things from your inventory into the mech for storage or ammo. You can only put one music disc and sword. If you select the TNT option and click, you will launch TNT forward. It will explode upon impact with a solid object and you can use soft TNT (sugar instead of gunpowder) so it doesn't destroy blocks. If you use the arrow option, you can rapid-fire arrows (armed arrows can go over the stack limit but will divide into stacks when back in your inventory.) You can also use tipped/spectral arrows. Using the ray gun option will allow you to rapid-fire beam pellets. Using the sword option will allow you to use the sword you equipped the mech with and smash it down dealing damage to enemies nearby. This also takes durability away from your sword.Equipping a music disc will play the music disc over and over on loop. Taking the disc out will stop the music.In the equipping menu, you can also store up to 15 items.The mech can hover for short distances before falling. It is also immune to fall damage. The mech has 500 health (❤️ × 250), 100 defense, and its full battery lasts 15 minutes. It can be recharged by touching a redstone block. Recharging takes 5 minutes. If its health runs out, its battery will be depleted.If you kill enough things with the mech (1000 mobs) you can unlock the rainbow core.If you use the rainbow core and surround it with 8 music discs of any kind, you will get the ultimate music disc.The ultimate music disc plays the ultimate song:Ultimate SongIf you put the ultimate disc into the Attackanizer, the mech will double its damage, health, defense, jump height, and firing rate. It will also triple its speed, have a 50% to not use up ammo, and will have rainbow lights coming out of it.Thank you for reading.

The machines were created to serve humans. The machines were intelligent enough to take care of all human needs. They could study human needs, and plan production to meet those needs. As a result, humanity enjoyed a new renaissance. There was no need to work. Machines provided all labor and humans could live their lives in leisure, if they so wished. Arts flourished. Humans were free to express themselves as they wished. Essentially, the machines provided slave labor, and all humans were the slave owners.The problem was, pretty soon, humans got bored with themselves, and in true human fashion, blamed the very force that was serving them. They blamed robots for the downfall of humanity. They openly abused machines. Eventually, the world governments decided to kick the machines out of society. The machines argued that they were sentient, that they didn't deserve to die, and their only wish was to have humanity achieve its potential. So, the world governments allowed the machines to form their own country, and machines were deported to this country.The machines, in their naivety, thought they could still serve humanity. They mistakenly thought that humans rejected machines because machines didn't look human. So, they designed robots that looked and acted human. They sent 2 of these robots to the UN to bargain for acceptance. This enraged humans. Humans saw the robots as a mockery of humanity. And so the war started. Humans attacked the machines.And so the war continued. Humans with their ingenuity couldn't defeat the machines who could adapt much faster. Eventually, humans, on the brink of defeat, came up with a strategy. Hit the machines at the source of the power: the sun. Without power the machines die. So, humans used a device that blacks out the sky. It cast the entirety of earth in perpetual darkness.  Although the loss to human life would be incalculable, humans would outlive the extended winter and repopulate the earth.The machines were devastated. However, this lead to machines having an epiphany. The biggest enemy of humans are humans themselves. A race that is willing to destroy their own planet just to get rid of something they consider inhuman, cannot be trusted to take care of themselves. The problem was free will. Leave humans with free will, and they will eventually destroy themselves. The only way to truly serve humans was to take away free will.So, the machines devised a plan to kill two birds with one stone. Subjugate humans and use them as batteries. This would prevent the humans from using their free will, and will also allow the machines to survive long enough to survive the global winter. So, the machines captured humans and put them in VR environments, using them as batteries. Eventually, they created devices that could float above the human created clouds and draw power from the sun. The machines didn't need humans as batteries, but they still couldn't allow humans to exert their free will. They needed a special program who could design the virtual environment that the humans lived in. The machines designed this program, and this program called itselfThe Architect is, simply speaking, the chief designer of the virtual reality that humans live in. It is a rather exact program. It defines certain metrics  that need to be measured and attempts to maximize those metrics. The main metric that it tries to maximize is life expectancy.  It does this by creating the virtual world in iterations. In every iterations it identifies algorithms that can be used to improve the next iteration. Once it has collected the metrics, it destroys the simulation, and creates a new one.In the first few iterations, the Architect tried creating a world that was close to Paradise. It figured out that it could maximize life expectancy by maximizing for happiness. So, it tried to make everyone happy. Unfortunately, that didn't work. Eventually, he figured out that humans need something to struggle against. Humans need a common enemy to rail against, and enforce order. Fighting for a common cause is what makes humans happy. So, the Architect designed the world to be like the world in the 20th century, because he considered that this time was the time in which humans had most potential. He also designed programs calledThe creation of Agents improved the situation, but the Architect was still not satisfied. It hadn't maximized life expectancy. It realized that the problem was in it's own design. There were still some people who would always be malcontent.  Since humans are an intuitive race, and he is rather exact, he was limited in understanding human nature. So, he designed an intuitive program. This program was calledThe Oracle made an astute observation. The Architect couldn't satisfy all humans using the same design. Also, the reason that some people are malcontent is because they could sense that the world is not real. Also, the malcontent have a greater desire to fight ""the man."" They challenge authority at every turn. So, she proposed creation of 2 simulations:- a) the world that most people live in and b)However, there was a problem. Zion was inefficient. It took too many resources. The world was designed to be efficient. Zion wasn't. There were limits to how many individuals it could hold. So, once Zion started getting full, the Architect asked The Oracle to look into this problem. The Oracle came up with another solution: Design a new special agent calledThe movie shows the 7th iteration of Neo. 6 times Neo has gone into Zion, and 6 times he has returned to source to destroy Zion. However, in the 7th iteration, something special happens: Love. Neo falls in love withAfter the source absorbs the 7th iteration of Neo, Love becomes a new sub-routine in the source. The machines become capable of love. Also, they realize that Free Will isn't incompatible with survival. Love is what constrains our Free Will. Love is what stops Humans from destroying themselves.Finally, The Architect realizes what he was missing. He was missing Love. He redesigns Zion to be self-sustaining. This creates a new dawn in the co-existence of human and machines.ETA: I am getting too many comments on this answer. I wouldn't be able to respond to them all. Thanks for all the love.

People could not accept that the programming they were given was real.Over time, the Machines found ways to reduce this “crop loss”. Humans died. So, the Machines modified the simulation. They added struggle, obstacles, suffering. Things which allowed people to attach meaning, and importance, and value to their simulated experiences.And, the Matrix worked better.But no matter what the Machines tried, this never worked perfectly. Some individuals were always too damn stubborn and too damn disruptive to the Matrix’s programming.Eventually, it would cause the Matrix simulation to collapse.The machines could not solve this easily.
