4,"Mining crypto-currency is not profitable at all. There are more than 1300 plus crypto-currencies present. I am only writing the basic rules that will help you to mine crypto-currencies successfully. Let discuss it with the help of Bitcoin.Bitcoin Mining Profitability FactorsHardware CostsThe most obvious expense in Bitcoin mining is mining hardware. Better, newer miners will cost more, so if you’re serious about investing in Bitcoin mining then aim for efficiency (more below). In addition to a Bitcoin miner, you may need extra cables, power supplies, software, and cooling fans.EfficiencyA bitcMining crypto-currency is not profitable at all. There are more than 1300 plus crypto-currencies present. I am only writing the basic rules that will help you to mine crypto-currencies successfully. Let discuss it with the help of Bitcoin.Bitcoin Mining Profitability FactorsHardware CostsThe most obvious expense in Bitcoin mining is mining hardware. Better, newer miners will cost more, so if you’re serious about investing in Bitcoin mining then aim for efficiency (more below). In addition to a Bitcoin miner, you may need extra cables, power supplies, software, and cooling fans.EfficiencyA bitcoin miner’s job is to convert electricity into hash power. Miners that do this using the least amount of electricity per hash are the most efficient. The Antminer S9, Antminer S7, for example, converts electricity to hash power at 0.25 W/Gh. The SP20 Jackson, a popular miner by Spondoolies Tech, converts at 0.65 w/Gh.Electricity costs vary by location, but this means that an Antminer S7 run in the same place as an SP20 converts electricity nearly three times more efficiently. It’s important to compare both hardware prices and efficiency when purchasing a miner.ElectricityMiners with low electricity costs have an advantage, as monthly costs are much lower. Venezuela’s government has implemented price controls, which has created some of the lowest electricity prices in the world. According to an article from Bitcoin Magazine, a 320 kw electric bill cost just 6 cents. About 1,000 people mine Bitcoin full time in Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is an extreme example, but shows how cheap electricity effects mining profitability.DifficultyBitcoin mining difficulty measures how difficult it is to find a new block. Assuming a stable Bitcoin price and no change in your hash rate, expect your earnings to decrease as difficulty increases. If difficulty were to decrease with a stable Bitcoin price, your profitability would increase.When taking difficulty into account, note that:To understand Bitcoin difficulty in details see my blog :Bitcoin PriceEarly Bitcoin miners were able to gather thousands of Bitcoin. At the time, however, one bitcoin wasn’t worth one penny. Bitcoin’s price, or the purchasing power of one bitcoin, must be considered. A sharp drop in price can turn slightly profitable miners unprofitable very quickly. Price changes are factor, but it often makes more sense to simply purchase bitcoins if your goal is Bitcoin price speculation.Block RewardBitcoin’s block reward halves every 210,000 blocks. Assuming the Bitcoin price remains the same, each block halving cuts miners’ profits in half. Even though block reward halvings are known events with expected dates, it can still have effects on the market and price of Bitcoin.Location and WeatherMining farms in hot areas will overheat and require large amounts of cooling fans. There have been fires at mining warehouses created by the excess heat. It is much easier to run a mining farm in cool areas. The heat generated from miners can even be used in place of regular heating to cut costs.DowntimeLarge mining operations have employees working 24/7 to ensure that all hardware is working properly. A few hours offline could be the difference between thousands of dollars in profits.Now that you understand the many factors that will affect your mining profitability, plug in some numbers to any Bitcoin mining calculator. Multiple calculators should be used to get the most accurate data.

However, in 2014 they were about to hit fifty percent of the overall network’s strength.Though hacking and manipulating the blockchain was not their goal, they decided to limit the size of their influence on the Bitcoin network. The pool owners promised never to go above forty percent of the network’s overall strength. They did this to protect Bitcoin’s value as currency holders might fear a 51% attack from one operator.If the value of Bitcoin plummeted, then BitFury’s profits would have been negatively impacted if not wiped out entirely. The necessary balance between potential profit and network power is another form of blockchain security. Too much network power will result in a loss of profit and the stability of the currency.Protect your cryptocurrency and digital assets with",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-absolute-dummies-get-started-with-cryptocurrency-mining-How-does-the-mining-differ-across-different-cryptocurrencies
