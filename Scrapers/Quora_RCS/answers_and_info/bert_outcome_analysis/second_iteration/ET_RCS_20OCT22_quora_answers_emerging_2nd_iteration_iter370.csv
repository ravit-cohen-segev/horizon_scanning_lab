The first of these was a concept developed by the British Interplanetary Society which they named, “Project Daedalus”. Propulsion was to be provided by a series of miniature nuclear explosions which would push the massive spacecraft to greater and greater velocities until it topped out at approximately 12% of the speed of light (the “c” in E=mc2). The emigre German physicist Friedwardt Winterberg contributed significantly to Daedalus with his “Winterberg/Daedalus Class Magnetic Compression Reaction Chamber”, a proposed starship drive that relies on multiple detonations of so-called “mini-nukes” .

This supplies an excess of neutrons to the reaction in the early stages, making the entire process faster, ensuring that the pit doesn’t disintegrate as an object before most of the atoms inside it do. Doing this means that we can have a bigger bang, or use less plutonium, which is one measure of “efficiency”.The complicated version of a thermonuclear bombWe can make an even bigger bang by putting a can of lithium deuteride next to the fission primary, letting it be compressed by the radiation from the detonation (eliding a few steps), making the lithium deuteride fuse. That’s a pretty efficient process, as most of the lithium and deuterium gets to fuse.If you want to add nuclear fuel to the fusion stage, that’s simple, you just add more lithium deuteride to the can. That’s how we make thermonuclear bombs in a variety of yields from 100 kilotons up to a few megatons. No need to do anything fancy outside the bomb.The fusion process is so efficient that the primary doesn’t need to be especially powerful and is the equivalent of a handful of kilotons. If you were determined to make a bigger bang with just plutonium, then you add tritium, as I mentioned above; you can also add more plutonium to the pit. Modern thermonuclear bombs use 2–3 kilos of plutonium; the first generation of nuclear weapons used 6.4 kilos; the second generation experimented with using more plutonium with a large hollow inside to stop it going critical with a more-than-critical mass. It’s a bit awkward, but adding more fuel to the primary at the design stage is doable.Whereas spraying more atoms into the mass at detonation is just not going to be very efficient at all. The neutrons from the mass going super-critical move at around 1% of the speed of light, so the disintegration of a softball-sized pit is over in about 100 times 10cm divided by three hundred million metres per second, which is thirty nanoseconds. This is a small window to aim your uranium hexafluoride ions through.Simulated beams in the LHCYou’re using an accelerator to get those ions up to near-lightspeed, I guess, so a 30-nano-light-second-long beam is about ten metres long. You’re not going to fit a lot of ions in that space. The Large Hadron Collider firesAnd that’s leaving aside that the uranium in those ions — the fluoride doesn’t do anything meaningful, and would probably just get in the way — is probably not going to interact with the neutrons in the chain reaction at all, being at the wrong speed. To cause a chain reaction, the neutrons have to be at a certain window of energies, and lightspeed atoms of uranium aren’t in it.If you’re trying to collide atoms of uranium into plutonium, I don’t even know what that will do, even whether you’d get more energy out of it than you put in. If not, then there’s no point to it, and you’ve just added a lot of weight to your Orion nuclear pulse engine that doesn’t do anything useful. You’re better off just spraying neutrons into the pit at the correct energies, which is, in fact, something that is done as well (see the neutron beam generator in the top diagram). Even if you do get more energy out, there’s still not a lot of point, since you could have just added more nuclear fuel to the bomb at manufacture.So, to sum up, to make more efficient use of plutonium, add tritium and relatively slow neutrons to the bomb at the moment of detonation. To make bigger bangs, add lithium deuteride at manufacture.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-process-do-we-have-to-take-to-run-a-fusion-reactor-e-g-hydrogen-fuel-maybe-heat-etc

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","18,328 followers",Mo Nastri,9.5K,389,4.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-other-developed-countries-not-creating-artificial-suns-like-China

Also in the same region is the firing mechanism that pushes a nuke out through a small hole in the center of the pusher plate every time the engine fires, the hole closes up with a fairly hefty blast shield between shots.There after you have your nuclear charge storage, likely in a couple of different yields or dial-a-yield types. These aren’t your garden variety nukes however, they are shaped charges, directing the vast majority of their energy in one direction, right up at the pusher plate. The theory of how to do that is fairly easy, the fine details still highly classified.Then finally you have your cargo and crew area. Some designs can carry multiple thousands of tons to saturn and back, within 6 months. Either way anything fragile is padded up and the crew in specially designed acceleration couches to try and make the repeated hammer blows coming through the ship, if not comfortable then at least not back wrecking.We could of built one of these any time in the last 50 years or more, modern technology means we could probably do it a bit better now however in the ways of material science and most of all computers. Unfortunately what these are best at we could never use them for, hauling heavy loads off of Earth into orbit, it wouldn’t even be that messy but I can hear the screams of the anti-nuclear crowd just thinking about it. They’d probably still scream (but nowhere near as loudly) if we restricted it to just orbit to orbit work or landing on uninhabitable, airless bodies.As with most advanced technology developed at the start of the space race it is more a matter of the political will being entirely absent to take the criticism, pay the initial hefty price tag and make it happen.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-other-developed-countries-not-creating-artificial-suns-like-China

I happen to drive past a state office every day, with a big American flag out front, and it seems like it’s at half-staff at least once every few months. I sometimes have no idea why it’s like that.When I was a kid, too, virtually every American flag in front of every business had a black MIA-POW flag underneath it.I rarely see those anymore. I suppose it makes sense, though. When I was a kid, every middle-aged person knew a Vietnam vet or were one themselves. The older (but still mobile and enjoying their retirement) guys were WWII vets. The really, really old guys may have been WWI vets.Now, 30 years later, The Vietnam vets are the retired ones, the WWII vets are the ones in the nursing homes, and the WWI vets… are all gone.",UNKNOWN,Michelle - MAD PIRATE QUEEN,636,4.2K,68.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-other-developed-countries-not-creating-artificial-suns-like-China
