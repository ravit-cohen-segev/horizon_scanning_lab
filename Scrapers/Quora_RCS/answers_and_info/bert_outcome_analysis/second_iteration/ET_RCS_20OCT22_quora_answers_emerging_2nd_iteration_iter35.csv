To do this, the owner installed a Bitcoin mining computer in the trunk of the car. The mining rig is then charged by the car’s supercharger while it mines Bitcoin.This is an interesting way to mine cryptocurrencies, but it could be very lucrative for the owner as his operating cost while mining the digital currencies is virtually zero. His only major investment is the cost of the mining rig itself, as well as the associated equipment and accessories.Some issues on the innovative Bitcoin mining strategyThe exploration of innovative and creative methods of mining Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is always a very interesting endeavor because of the continuous increase in the price of the digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin.The use of the superchargers of electric vehicles like the Tesla model could be a good idea, but some issues may arise. Among these concerns is the possibility that the mining rig could produce lots of heat that could damage the car’s internal parts over time. The car’s battery pack could also be easily damaged when used continuously for Bitcoin mining.Despite its great potential and possibly good profits, Tesla or other electric car owners should decide carefully if they want to use this approach to mine cryptocurrencies due to its potential adverse effects on the performance of their cars.Those who want to mine digital currencies may also want to explore other approaches in mining like the use of renewable energies like solar panels.However, because they are still in the early phase of developments, these new technologies require a hefty upfront investment. Miners should be prepared to spend a large amount of money if they decide to mine Bitcoin using these methods.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,850,996,155.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-mine-Bitcoin-with-my-car

It also warned investors against speculative crypto trading.At one point on last Friday nearly $1 trillion was wiped off the market capitalization of the entire crypto sector. In early afternoon trading, their market cap was $1.6 trillion, according to data tracker coingecko.Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, had already been under pressure from a series of tweets from Tesla's Musk.Cryptocurrency price declines last week were sparked by Musk's reversal on Tesla accepting bitcoin as payment, citing the heavy environmental toll of ""mining"" bitcoin, which requires a lot of electricity to power the computers that create bitcoin.Amid Wednesday's crypto sell-off, Musk tweeted a 'diamond hands' emoji, used in social media to signal a position worth holding on to.Bitcoin has dropped some 40% from a record high of $64,895 hit on April 14. On Saturday, it hit a low of $30,066 and was last down 13% at $37,323. Tesla shares fell 2.5% two days back.""Any asset which has risen as much as bitcoin over the past year can be expected to have pullbacks as some investors withdraw profits, like we're currently seeing.""Bitcoin's decline whacked other crypto assets, with ether , the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, last down 22.5% at $2,320.Meme-based dogecoin also tumbled, losing nearly 26%, at 35 cents, according to Coingecko.But Still , Bitcoin was 0.01 USD in the earlier days.Now , You can decide whether we are in a Cryptocurrency bubble or not.Thank you readind and Wishes from Spheroid Universe :)",639 followers,Said Nusir,572,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-mine-Bitcoin-with-my-car

Bitcoin is just too slow to innovate. They have hundreds of developers and every change needs to get signed off by the community. This paralyses innovation. Too many cooks…2: Implosion and recovery of the banking industrySince the main service of banks, storing money, likely to not be need anymore within the next 3 years, 80% of bankers will lose their jobs and 80% of banks will probably have to shut down.However, a few banks will survive, the ones which create services around cryptocurrencies, such as loans, payment gateways, consulting, security improvements.3: Implosion of very large industries and subsequent reshapementThe blockchain will have the biggest impact of very complex industries, where there are lots of gatekeepers and middlemen that take out money and put it into their own pockets. The blockchain democratizes everything and take the power from very few to the many.There are 14 industries that I identified as such. These areVoting, Healthcare, Gambling, Pension Funds, Energy, Gaming, Real-Estate, Lending, Ticketing, ISPs, Decentralized Storage, Security Identification, Adult.

8,"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are certainly not just a financial phenomenon. They are founded upon the attempt to create a completely new type of universal value.It seems as if there is nothing backing such currencies other than cryptographic algorithms. However, the cryptography is intended to provide reliability and trust, which holds value in and of itself. It is as if the creators of cryptocurrencies are declaring that human nature and all of its “baggage” has no access to this territory.The modern financial system cannot boast such a feature.

They are founded upon the attempt to create a completely new type of universal value.It seems as if there is nothing backing such currencies other than cryptographic algorithms. However, the cryptography is intended to provide reliability and trust, which holds value in and of itself. It is as if the creators of cryptocurrencies are declaring that human nature and all of its “baggage” has no access to this territory.The modern financial system cannot boast such a feature. Instead, its money is produced by banks and is a factor of the political and economic influences of specific countries and organizations. In other words, the “old” money serves very specific interests.On the other hand, before our very eyes emerges a new, extra-governmental, extra-historical currency, claiming to become a universal, absolute equivalent, even to a point of driving gold out of its immovable position.Why did Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ultimately come about?The birth of cryptocurrency comes as a result of a new need for it ripening in today’s increasingly globalized society. Although many people criticize globalization, it is nonetheless a natural phenomenon that reflects humanity’s current state. We have become one technological and economic whole, but we still reject our state of oneness psychologically.That is why we still do not know how to use and integrate cryptocurrencies systematically into the mainstream. Yet it still does not change its essence: that the global world is demanding a global monetary equivalent independent of local, subjective “circumstances” and interests.The overblown human ego on a global scale is gradually building respective global systems for itself in a way that makes no artificial ideological attachments. There is no “good” or “evil” here, but only business in its purest form. Also, what difference does it make if the reciprocal trust of the parties is provided by virtual computer computations? On the contrary, it makes it even better; there will be fewer errors in the calculations. It turns out that we are talking about global trends and, for the most part, it makes no sense to resist them.In the future, we will develop more universal parameters, but of a social nature. The day will come when, by virtue of a new quality of interconnection between us, a new “currency” will emerge—social rating—expressed by a clear equivalent that anyone can understand.People will be able to accumulate it as well, but not sell or buy it. It is more likely to have a comparative nature while having completely real value. It is because society, especially a global one, cannot be based on just bare egoism alone. Of course, it is rational in its own way, but when left to its own devices, it leads to a dead end. Our social aspect must take the upper hand over self-focus so that the whole will not fall apart into pieces. These are the paradigms of a new time, whose essence is not a single currency, but new relationships between people in a united, modern world.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,735,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-mine-Bitcoin-with-my-car

The Ethereum network also serves as the foundation for the majority of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), making it the world's most functional and useful blockchain.HubCoin (HUB)This is the place to be if you're a gamer or a game aficionado. This token incorporates smart contract technology into the gaming world, allowing gamers to have a new gaming experience. HubCoin ($HUB) is the Hubber platform's native token. On the Ethereum network, it is released as an ERC token. Through the use of smart contracts, HubCoin allows for the construction of trustless, decentralized, and non-custodial tournaments, as well as adding value to gamers' gaming experiences through the use of blockchain technology.Solana (SOL)When compared to Ethereum, Solana is a relative newcomer to the crypto world. However, Solana's popularity has soared, becoming it the fourth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Solana also permits apps and NFTs, however the network currently only has roughly 350 projects on it. The unique combination of proof-of-history and proof-of-stake transaction verification procedures used by Solana is substantially faster than Ethereum's proof-of-work (PoW) methodology. Solana is also less expensive than Ethereum and uses less energy than PoW models, making it a more environmentally friendly cryptocurrency than Bitcoin and Ethereum.",639 followers,Said Nusir,572,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-for-a-sustainable-investment

They have no other choice. The Federal Reserve Scam is failing. Inflation is about to burst. Monopolizing the money supply is about to come back and haunt the USA like most people can't even fathom.The elites didn't just wake up one day and decide they're against tyranny. They're addicted to it. Crypto-currency outside of government (less control) & those being created by governments (more control) will soon begin competing.
