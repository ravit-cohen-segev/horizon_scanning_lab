But that's what people seem to think when they hear ""miniature fusion plant.""Pro tip: the physics of fusion power do not support the concept of automobile-scale fusion.Here's a small nuclear power plant. I have helpfully indicated the size of theUniStar scraps plans for Nine Mile Point 3 nuclear power plantUniStar scraps plans for Nine Mile Point 3 nuclear power plantAnd here's my detailed conceptual rendering of a ""miniature"" fusion reactor power plant with the same power output:Congratulations, you just took the smallest part of the power plant and made it marginally smaller. Wooooo. Earth-shattering. </sarcasm>Congratulations, you just took the smallest part of the power plant and made it marginally smaller. Wooooo. Earth-shattering. </sarcasm>I'll start giving a crap when someone figures out a way to bypass the steam turbine and produce electrical energy directly from a nuclear reaction. But good luck with that -- again, the fundamental physical laws don't support the premise.Fusion Doesn't Mean FuelFor at least the next 30 years, liquid hydrocarbon fuels will be necessary for the majority of passenger automobile travel, and the entirety of air travel and heavy cargo shipping. It's simply an energy density issue -- galvanic cell batteriesElectricity cost barely impacts this -- liquid hydrocarbons are just outright superior to batteries for transport applications. Energy density is king. It's more about physics than economics.And without such a massive global shift to electric cars, electricity generation really doesn't impact the oil/gas industry. That means fusion power is completely irrelevant to half the world's primary energy production.Fusion Doesn't Mean FreeFirst off, any sane company would charge only slightly less for fusion power than we currently pay for existing electricity sources. It's simple profit motive -- you charge the most you can while still capturing market share. But even if by sheer philanthropy theElectricity will never be zero-cost.And that would be a lovely price to pay for electricity,Consider the golden days of nuclear fission plant construction. Pro-nuclear activists claimed the power would be ""too cheap to meter"" and they weren't too far off. Power from an early nuclear plant -- before activist opposition and post-Chernobyl safety precautions increased costs -- was only about $0.02-0.04/kWh, adjusted for inflation. The US started a massive reactor construction program that churned out power plants fast enough to transform the face of US energy production. It dwarfed the scale of today's renewables growth. And did the world change? I would say there was a resounding ""Don't get me wrong, cheaper energy is awesome. If electricity becomes free at the point of generation but still costs money to transmit, lots of thingsAvailabilityIt pains me to admit it, but many studies show minimal long-term impact on developed nations from higher energy costs. Studies vary on this subject but the point is, the effect isn't enormous. In modern service-oriented economies, high energy costs primarily manifest as a negative impact on the inflation rate and growth rate. Again, cheaper energy is awesome, but it isn't world-changing. TAnd there would be some waste, too. People would set their thermostats lower in summer. People would buy electric heaters instead of high-efficiency heat pumps. More lights would stay on when no one's in the room. Electric kettles would be left on all day to keep the water hot for tea. You can see this behavior today in countries that heavily subsidize energy. It's arguable whether that's a good thing.And don't even get meIn fact, it's one of the most unnatural and expensive substances on the planet -- running around $30,000/gram with a global usage rate under 400 grams per year. Compare to an existing enormously-valuable nuclear fuel,So fusionThere ain't no such thing as a free lunch.To summarize --Sorry guys.

1,"Mr. Carlyle’s argument is a straw man. He’s created a false concept of what fusion power is and will accomplish and then spent about 20 paragraphs opining on why those things aren’t realistic. Unfortunately he has missed the point entirely. NO ONE is claiming that fusion reactors will (or even should be) small, cheap, replace gasoline engines or any other such nonsense.  Fusion reactors are simply a better way of generating electricity in a world that is hungry for more and more electricity every year. Any device that can meet that demand, even partially, without adding to the ongoing problemsMr. Carlyle’s argument is a straw man.

Unfortunately he has missed the point entirely. NO ONE is claiming that fusion reactors will (or even should be) small, cheap, replace gasoline engines or any other such nonsense.  Fusion reactors are simply a better way of generating electricity in a world that is hungry for more and more electricity every year. Any device that can meet that demand, even partially, without adding to the ongoing problems of air/carbon/greenhouse gas pollution and nuclear waste IS, in fact, world changing.Before I begin, let’s define what fusion IS and what it IS NOT so that we’re operating from a solid foundation. I’ll begin with the definition from Encyclopedia Britannica:In other words, fusion is a source of electricity. It is NOT ‘free energy’ and no one is claiming that it is.NOW let’s look at the (widely accepted) ADVANTAGES OF FUSION ENERGY:Fusion Energy Foundation Goals, Initiatives and AdvantagesBut don’t take my word for it:Ok, now we know that we’re talking about something simple - electricity - so let's take his arguments point by point and I'll explain why he is incorrect.1.) Fusion Doesn’t Mean SmallCOUNTERPOINT:2.) ""COUNTERPOINT:Fusion is an energy source, not a propulsion system. Any attempt to compare the two is wrong from the get-go. Fusion reactors don’t NEED to be small enough to cram into an automobile in order to change the world. They only need to produce clean electrical energy. From there that energy can be delivered to homes, businesses and charging stations that can/will/are used to power electrical vehicles. As the automobile fleets of the world transition to electrical vehicles the need for clean abundant energy will increase year upon year. Fusion can help meet that demand by replacing aging coal-fired and traditional fission power plants thus nullifying their negative environmental impacts, i.e. nuclear accidents (Fukushima, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl) and carbon (a typical coal plant emits between 7,000 and 14,000 tons of carbon per year.To put it more simply, to change the world fusion reactors need only to replace coal-fired and nuclear fission power plants. The dirtiest and most dangerous sources of power. Even if that’s ALL they did that would be enough to ‘change the world’.BUT that’s not the end of this counterpoint! Lockheed Martin is presently developing a compact fusion reactor that is “small enough to fit on a truck"" (their words). From their site: ""A reactor small enough to fit on a truck could provide enough power for a small city of up to 100,000 people.”Compact Fusion2.)COUNTERPOINT:Putting cars and trucks aside for a moment, the U.S. Navy is already powering fleets of ships and submarines using small-scale nuclear reactors - so it CAN be done on ships, subs and in aircraft. Replacing those fission reactors with small-scale fusion reactors is not only technically feasible it’s preferable from a strategic standpoint as the fuel source for fusion reactors, deuterium, is derived from seawater.Speaking of ships, according to a 2009 report by The Guardian, in one year a single large container ship can emit pollution equivalent to that generated by 50 MILLION cars.Health risks of shipping pollution have been 'underestimated'The civilian shipping industry burns anywhere from 250 million to 300 million TONS of bunker fuel per year to accommodate the needs of our global economy. Bunker fuel is 1,000 times dirtier than highway diesel used in automobiles. Because of this, the shipping industry generates between 10 and 30 percent of global atmospheric pollution depending on how you calculate the numbers. Replacing even 10% of those ships with fusion powered nuclear ships would not only save billions in annual fuel expenditures for shipping companies but it would reduce the pollution output of the industry by tens of thousands of tons of carbon per year. I’d call that world changing.3.) Fusion Doesn’t Mean FreeCOUNTERPOINT:No one ever said power has to be ‘free’ to ‘change the world.’ What we’re talking about here is a  clean, safe, abundant energy source. What we pay for that will be worked out by the economics. In other words, that ‘problem’ if you want to call it that - will sort itself out as fusion finds its footing in a rapidly diversifying energy infrastructure. It will have to eventually compete with solar and wind and consumers will have a choice of where their power comes from and how much they pay for it will be determined by the marketplace.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

That would almost overnight (in relative terms) shut down the pollution from power generation in many third world countries and also China.  A small design like this would be low cost (not free!) and more importantly it would not increase carbon emissions.

Those plants are already under fire for heavy pollution and CO2 emissions, so I would bet that as soon as a proven viable alternative exists that can go anywhere a coal plant currently is, that does the same job without any CO2 emissions, the regional generators will jump to replace their coal plants and get out from under the ""cap and trade"". Coal might continue to be worth producing for a decade or so during the transition and for export to developing nations that will have to wait for the technology to become more mainstream, but a working proof-of-concept fusion plant will be coal's final death knell.Petroleum producers and refiners will probably fare much better for the medium term; gasoline and diesel aren't going anywhere without significant improvements in either electrolytic charge storage capacity or portable high-efficiency fuel cell technology.  Transportation usage alone makes up 68% of petroleum consumption in the United States. A further 25% is used industrially, and it's unclear what the divide is between use of the petroleum chemicals themselves for polymer production (which fusion power wouldn't replace), and burning the stuff for heat such as in metal refining/recycling (grid power can be used for this kind of work, but large changes in existing petroleum-fired smelters would be needed). About 5.8% is used for residential and commercial heating/cooking needs, where a significant investment would be needed for a switchover to all-electric (and loss of gas cooktops would be resisted by foodies), while only 1.4% of U.S. petroleum consumption is for grid electricity.However, with grid power becoming insanely cheap over a few decades, the industrial sector would likely take steps to reduce petroleum consumption for industrial heating, and even if industrial use were cut by half and all other sources remained the same, we'd likely see a price collapse in petroleum as demand from the biggest bulk consumers would disappear rapidly. That will lead to abandonment of the lowest-margin oil production projects, like the tar sands, as the price decline makes those unprofitable. That will cost jobs in the short term during a transition from petroleum production to fusion fuel production (building and running water electrolysis plants, mostly).Something tells me that production of the fuel used by the plant, probably hydrogen isotopes, is not considered into the energy costs of the plant. We could use renewables, like solar and wind, to run hydrogen production plants. That could lead to increased development of renewable sources, but depending on the margins of energy consumption to production that this new plant could provide, the plant might do better than breakeven even if it were electrolyzing its own fuel. If that's the case, we'll likely abandon all other forms of energy production including renewables, which will cost R&D and construction jobs in those sectors.In summary, the biggest losers will be those who are unable to adapt to change, as has always been the case. The typewriter replaced dozens of hand copyists requiring perfect penmanship with a couple dozen typists able to produce a completely legible document in a fraction of the time of hand copying. So, if you wanted to stay employed, you learned to type. The photostatic copier (Xerox machine) in turn replaced the typing pool with just one or two secretaries, so if you wanted to stay employed, you had to find something else to do where your typing skills were valued for something beyond rote copying of documents.","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

And the 4th generation nuclear power plants will just reuse the waste our current power plants are producing. Fusion can keep the world running for all time but if we extract uranium from the bottom of the ocean or the ocean itself fission can keep the world running for 2 billion years. The technological leap is not as great as people make it out to be as modern nuclear power plants already have 0% CO2 emission. So we already have the technology needed to save the environment and the planet. When people compare fusion with fission they often compare it to nuclear power plants from the 60'ties. And that would actually be a significant technological leap.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,609,7.8K,406.3M,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

No data is available on stability, power quality, reliability or even little things like wattage. No grid management studies exist on plugging the the thing in. There aren't factories somewhere waiting to churn these things out, and there are no supply chains and companies in place to distribute, construct and operate them. There is no operational history for anyone to look at to assess true risks and costs and make informed decisions about inclusion in their generation purchasing strategies or not.All of those things must occur before it can have any significant impact on the world. If everything goes insanely well and their concept actually works, it will probably be 30 years before all of the above is actually true about it.And in 30 years, wind and solar power will be so thoroughly dominant at such lower costs and with so much lower concerns about massive liabilities if the devices should catastrophically fail that there's no reason to believe that fusion will be competitive. In 30 years, nuclear generation in total will have diminished further than it already is, having been in world wide decline in absolute and relative terms for almost a decade already as of 2014. In 30 years, the ongoing disruption of grid management and operation organizations -- the classic utilities -- by renewables will have continued. Who pays for transmission and how will have been solved, so net-metering fights will be over. Fusion will just be another option in a transformed grid, and undoubtedly not the cheapest, safest and most broadly deployable one.In other words, fusion might have changed the world if we had made it viable 30 years ago, but if it finally becomes viable at scale it will be at a point when it's fairly irrelevant.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

Also, it’s fuel is generally not highly radioactive (perhaps some tritium is involved). The whole thing is therefore a lot cleaner in that respect.Both fusion and fission reactors will irradiate their containment vessels, and render then radioactive to some extent, but even then the fission reactor will be a lot worse.nb.

10,"Yes, as a matter of fact, it does. There are two sources: the primary, a fission bomb that starts the fusion burn in the secondary, and a sparkplug and optional uranium tamper which both fission. The secondary itself may have leftover tritium from the secondary burn; that’s lightly radioactive as well.The sparkplug is a rod of plutonium or U-235 running down the middle of the secondary which, when fissioned by neutrons from the primary, squeezes the secondary to the necessary fusion pressure.","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most
11,"Yes, nuclear fusion releases harmful ionizing radiation.In the “typical” tokomak fusion device, deuterium and tritium (hydrogen with 1 and 2 extra neutrons, respectively) are forced to fuse in a high-energy plasma cloud that is energized and contained by magnetic fields, releasing a total of ~17 Mev in energy, mostly as a high-speed neutron.

A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a fusion-electric car or other small fusion application (Iron Man Suit?). Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).The energy required from a fusion driver to successfully ignite small sub-gram DT ICF fusion capsules has been experimentally shown[1] to be about 20 MJ delivered to a 2mm spot in less than 3 nanoseconds. 20 MJ is the amount of energy released when burning 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline. The requirements of He3-He3 fuson are expected to be about 40X requirements for DT ICF fusion.Will there ever be small fusion reactors directly powering fusion cars, planes, rockets, and even power tools?Perhaps not in the near term.Small fusion reactors with low shielding requirements powered by He3-He3 aneutronic fusion will probably arise at some point in our future. The style of fusion device most likely to support this style of fusion is Inertial Confinement Fusion.[1] - Cold war Halite-Centurion Field Tests at the Nevada Test SiteNY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests - Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among ScientistsSecret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among ScientistsThe following document contains what John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE""Development of the Indirect drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain."" John Lindl. Page: 3937. AIP Physics of Plasma. American Institute of Physics, 14 June 1995.http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/Sha...Fusion Rocketry -At some point fusion rockets are almost certain to be built.Fusion nuclear fuels are 10^11 times more prevalent in the universe as any combination of fission nuclear fuels. If you want to explore the universe and go where no one else has gone, it is better to use nuclear fusion rather than chemical rockets or nuclear fission based rockets.Using an aneutronic fusion fuel cycle like p-B11 is not required for astronaut safety. Fast neutrons from DD and DT fusion can be safely shielded with only modest spacecraft mass penaltyTo reduce the radiation hazard for manned missions to Mars and beyond, a high-specific-impulse –high-thrust system is needed. Such system could be produced by a repeated serial burst inertial confinement pure fusion propulsion system.Igniting fusion fuels in discrete controlled pure fusion thermonuclear bursts would require a compact pure fusion driver (laser or ion beam) capable of delivering around 20 MJ of energy focused into a 2mm diameter spot within less than 2 to 3 nanoseconds. Convenient scalable pure fusion energy from a repeated serial burst ICF system can be achieved using a hybrid two-stage DT-DD fusion capsule. The primary first stage of the hybrid two-stage fusion target uses a half gram of the easiest to ignite Deuterium-Tritium fuel. The secondary stage consists of a long thin tapered cylinder that holds cryo-deuterium liquid under great static pressure. Ignition is achieved via a laser or light-ion particle beam fusion driver which ignites the small spherical DT primary and produces a shock ignited thermonuclear detonation wave in the compressed deuterium liquid in the slightly tapered cylindrical secondary. The length of the cylindrical secondary can be arbitrarily long and the yield of the device can be conveniently tuned to any desired yield over a wide range. To avoid a large radiator, needed to remove the heat from the absorption of the fast neutrons in the spacecraft, the microexplosion is surrounded by a thick layer of liquid hydrogen, stopping the neutrons and heating the hydrogen to a temperature of ∼ 10^5 K, which as a fully ionized plasma can be repelled from the spacecraft by a magnetic mirror.While both DD and DT fusion produces neutrons, the problem of neutron shielding required to provide safety for astronauts and Mars colonists while on their 30 day or less transit to a destination like Mars can be accomplished by constructing the spacecraft along the lines of the 2001 Space Odyssey Discovery spacecraft. The Discovery was a very long spacecraft that separated by a long distance the forward spherical crew section from the fusion nuclear engines at the rear. The solid angle required to completely shield astronauts from neutron radiation is small and the mass of shielding required is relatively small. Effective shielding for high energy DT and DD fusion neutrons can be arranged in a two stage process.In DT fusion, about 80% of the fusion energy is released into fast neutrons while in DD fusion 66% of the energy of fusion is released into neutrons. Fast neutrons from DT and DD fusion cannot be deflected by a nozzle formed as a magnetic mirror. Still worse, the neutrons would heat the spacecraft, which then would requires a large radiator to dissipate heat into space. This problem can be addressed by surrounding the neutron-releasing DT-DD fusion burst with a sufficiently thick layer of surrounding liquid hydrogen. This layer greatly reduces the energy of the fast neutrons which are then be absorbed by the boron-carbide layer of the fusion nozzle. The heating the thick layer of hydrogen to the high temperatures would cause it to become a fully ionized plasma, which could be deflected by a magnetic mirror. The alpha particles of the DT-DD thermonuclear reactions are stopped at a distance much smaller than the fast neutrons in the boron-carbide face of the fusion rocket nozzle.The first stage shielding then uses the thick layer of liquid hydrogen. Materials composed of light low Z elements slow neutrons primarily via elastic scattering. Collisions of neutrons with nuclei similar in mass to that of a neutron transfer more energy per scatter than collisions with heavy nuclei, and so require fewer scattering events for the same energy loss. The neutrons are then fully absorbed and stopped in the layer of boron-carbide facing the fusion rocket nozzle and the rear of the spacecraft. Supplementary radiation shielding along the critical solid angle between the fusion rocket engines and the astronaut crew compartment can be supplied by storing crew drinking water in such a way as to block and absorb neutrons before they enter the crew compartment.At some point more advanced fusion reactions like He3-He3 and P-B11 will be used that release their energy primarily as charged particles (protons and charged alpha particles). In the case of advanced fusion reactions that produce few (or no) neutrons, a magnetic nozzle can be used to direct thrust away from the rocket.Drawing of a pulsed magnetic nozzle used to protect a fusion rocket emitting charged particles like protons or alpha particles from hot plasma exhaust.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)",3 followers,Amogh Joshi,6.5K,359,3.3M,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

The magnetic field strength is measured in Tesla, and can be any value from 10^-4 to around 10^1.For fusion to occur (order of magnitude estimates), ions need to be traveling around 10^6 m/s. A deuterium ion has a mass around 10^-27 kg, and a charge of around 10^-19 coulombs. This simplifies the above to approximately:r ~= 10^-2 / BIf B is 1 (a reasonable low-end estimate), the gyroradius is about 1cm, or about 1/2 inch. Note that the stronger the magnetic field is, the smaller the Gyroradius is.The magnetic confinement must be large enough to allow 100’s to 100000’s of these radii. so that as the ions spin around in their magnetic confinement they can collide (amongst many other things). Assuming 1000 radii (a swag on my part):radius of containing tube ~= 10/B (or 10 meters with a 1T field)The containing tube needs superconducting magnetic wire around it to create the magnetic field. This is very dependent on the diameter of the wire, its current carrying capacity, and where it is applied (inside or outside the neutron capture), but with modern superconductor this can add less than 15cm or 6 inches to the radius.Using ‘stronger’ superconductors is the directionOf course, your results will vary.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.3K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

We know that in stars because of the proto-star mass, atomic friction creates the necessary heat (about 3 million degrees Celsius) for the Fusion of hydrogen to begin. And thus a star is born and the balance of its mass trying to crush it and the fusion process trying to blow it up keep the star working for hundreds of millions of years to trillions of years, depending on the class of star.Now, scientists on Earth have been trying to mimic what a star does. Either through Inertial, Electromagnetic, or Inertial Static Electromagnetic Confinement. We even have a process named crossfire (more known as aneutronic) fusion. None of them actually work! They can make nuclear fusion but only by spending more energy than the energy they get in return.So what makes Fusion so hard? The Electromagnetic Force!If you want to understand how strong that fundamental force is, then here's a little perspective. Imagine the Earth gravity increased to a magnitude of 10^36… That's how strong the Electromagnetic Force is. And trying to beat it by force is obviously a challenge, basically a losing battle.So many real scientists, have been working on new methods that completely deviate from the more known current methods.And many believe that only through nanotechnology we'll be able to achieve nuclear fusion by creating manmade atomic structures with room temperature superconductive properties.But this is not the real limit to the tech in terms of size, more like what is now believed is the basis to make fusion actually work. And that the real potential for miniaturization lies with Quantum Mechanics. So in theory if we ever reach that level of technological advancement, then you could have nuclear fusion power cells the size of cellphone batteries. Or much, much smaller.The reality is that we haven't even began to understand the limits of what is possible, less alone say with a mouthful what is and isn't possible.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,537,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most
