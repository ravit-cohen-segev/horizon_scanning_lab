It is very difficult to create these pressures on earth because we don't have the gravitational mass that a star has so we have to compensate by increasing the temperature even higher and doing what we can to confine the nuclei (magnetic confinement) so they collide. Raising the temperature this high requires a tremendous amount of energy and powering the confinement system does too. We can do it, but we haven't sustained it long enough for it to power itself (called breakeven -- where we are getting as much energy out as we are putting into it). Once we can achieve breakeven, the fusion reactor will then be able to power itself. Naturally though, even when this occurs, you basically have a little star on earth that has to be confined by actual materials instead of gravity, especially the supercooled electromagnets so that presents all sorts of engineering issues. The electromagnets keep the plasma from touching the walls of the container but again, once you start generating enough heat from the fusion energy dissipating, you have to get that heat out of there extremely quickly or else the temperature of the supercooled electromagnets increases which decrease the magnetic permeability -- weakening the magnetic field -- and thereby decreases the pressure... so then you stop fusing.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-we-not-get-Nuclear-Fusion-to-work-effectively

I cover a few below, take from myReducing Conduction:Conduction is the loss of mass.  The electrons and ions escape when they touch surfaces.  Energy leaves with this mass.  Conduction losses kill Fusors.  Fortunately, we can steer the ions and electrons.  Like cars on a highway, they will follow electric and magnetic field lines.  Hence any solution, cannot have fields that run into surfaces (high re circulation).  The Polywell is a fusor variant which follows this rule.  Tokamaks, the levitating dipole, spheromaks and stellarators all reduce conduction in the same way.  But, sharply curving fields are not perfect.  Plasma will drift outwards in a curved field.  This flings it against the walls [68].  This could be reduced by lowering the overall temperature [49, page 43].  The polywell and biconic cusp may also lose mass by scattering it through the center [52].Reducing Radiation:Radiation is the loss of energy.  Plenty of energy leaves the cloud as light.  Radiation includes visible, x-ray, infrared and ultraviolet.  When electrons are packed densely enough, they will reabsorb this energy [17].  This is why lead can absorb x-rays [53].  In plasmas, this critical density is difficult to reach.  The x-rays may also be reflected off the chamber walls [54].  However, the plasma may not be dense enough to reabsorb the reflected light [17].There (may) also be opportunities to tune the plasma.   Though thermalized bell curves are the most common plasma system, non-thermal plasma do exist and no one really knows how long they could be trapped for.  The plasma trap is inexorably connected to the energy distribution of the plasma inside it - and this really drives the radiation losses.  The hypothetical, ideal distribution for the polywell is shown below.Raising Efficiency:Efficiency may be the most unexplored concept in fusion.  Efficiency means changing the input and output energies.  Few groups explore lowering the input power.  The NIF system is horribly inefficient.  For every unit of laser energy, about 200 times that amount in electrical energy is used [69].  In response, the naval research labs have designed a 7% efficient laser.  However, without ignition this will not matter [70].Increasing output power means finding better ways to capture the energy.  Three methods have been purposed.  The first is using the neutrons from fusion to recharge fission material [71].  This seems unlikely for cost effectiveness.  It may be a good commercial application for fusors.  The second is using heat to capture the energy.  This method is valid for deuterium and deuterium tritium fuel and will have a typical power plant efficiency.  The last method is using direct conversion to capture the energy.Direct Conversion:Direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage.  This voltage drives electricity in a wire.  This becomes the electrical power.  People usually see this process in reverse.  Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion.  Direct conversion does the opposite. It has been described is a linear accelerator running backwards [90].  William Barr deserves a share of credit for demonstrating direct conversion.  Over ten years he developed experimental and theoretical systems to prove this concept.  Dr. Barr retired from Livermore and passed away in 2004 [72].Material from a fusion reactor has positive ions, negative electrons and neutrals.  The exhaust comes in as random gas.  The converter has to beat this stuff into submission and extract energy from it.  The basic design is shown here [74, 75, 76].Bottom line: there are LOTS of good fusion ideas out there, and LOTS of unexplored approaches.  But, without the funding or manpower we will never know if they will amount to a commercially viable net power reactor.Citations:69.  Moses, Edward I.

Witkowski states that he was given access to the transcript of Sporrenberg’s statements by an unidentified present day Polish intelligence officer, and that he was allowed to take some notes but not to copy the original papers. To my knowledge he has never disclosed the identity of his contact in Poland’s spy agency.A number of postwar writers, particularly Joseph Farrell and Henry Stevens, have speculated that The Bell had something to do with Nazi interest in anti-gravity, as did Witkowski himself. The WWII German scientific enterprise was in fact interested in exotic concepts such as anti-gravity and zero point energy, but it is unlikely that Die Glocke had anything to do with these, at least not directly or specifically. (Note that of the two, zero point energy research was much the more legitimate and comprehensive effort, and was directly related to other German work in the fields of quantum mechanics, extreme cold, and superdense elements. Explorations of ZPE continue today.Rather, there is fragmentary but fairly consistent evidence pointing to The Bell as a kind of alternate technology for the breeding of fissile elements for use in nuclear weapons—specifically, that it was an early attempt at building what is today known as an “accelerator driven system” or ADS.Computer Graphic Image of the Likely Appearance of “Die Glocke”.Accelerator-driven subcritical reactor - WikipediaAccelerator-driven Nuclear EnergyThis device was said to have been nicknamed “the beehive” because it produced a loud buzzing sound when in operation. It was also claimed that both human and animal tissues would suffer catastrophic damage if in close proximity to the machine while it was running. This would be consistent with the presence of extremely powerful electromagnetic fields and related phenomena.Keep in mind that nearly the entire late war, underground German secret weapons empire was the domain of the SS and supervised by Sporrenberg’s superior, the notorious General Ing (Engineer) Hans Kammler. Of all the WWII NaziGunson believes, and I concur, that the German approach from this end of their nuclear weapons effort may have employed a technology known as “recoil based fuel breeding”. The extract of the 2008 paper, “Recoil Based Fuel Breeding Fuel Structure” by Liviu Popa-Simil states:In nuclear reactors, the use of nano-particulate pellets could facilitate the recoil implantation for breeding, transmutation and partitioning purposes. Using enriched 238U or 232Th leads to 239Pu and 233U production while using other actinides as 240Pu, 241Am etc. leads to actinide burning. When such a lattice is immersed into a radiation resistant fluid (water, methanol, etc.), the recoiled product is transferred into the flowing fluid and removed from the hot area using a concentrator/purifier, preventing the occurrence of secondary transmutation reactions.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231955480_Recoil_Based_Fuel_Breeding_Fuel_StructureNazi Bell UncoveredThe Bell is believed to have utilized extraordinarily high voltage electrical currents which may have converted thorium-232 into the fourth state of matter—plasma—and then transmuted it into very pure, weapons grade uranium-233, perhaps with the help of a mysterious substance (red mercury?) code-named “Xerum 525”. Although Popa-Simil’s paper is talking about recoil based fuel breeding in (presumably—) conventional modern nuclear reactors, as far as I know it is possible that the same or similar process could also have worked via plasma physics. In addition, another, more recent paper mentions a number of concepts and substances related to the thorium fuel cycle in certain types of reactors, and which are known to have been explored, though perhaps in different contexts and from different starting points, by the Germans in WWII. The abstract for this document states:Thorium is a fertile element that can be applied in the conceptual blanket design of a fusion-fission hybrid energy reactor, in which 232Th is mainly used to breed 233U by capture reaction. It is essential to validate 232Th nuclear data by carrying out integral fusion neutronics experiments for macroscopic thorium assemblies. The thorium assemblies with a D-T fusion neutron source consist of a polyethylene shell, depleted uranium shell, and thorium oxide cylinder.From the 2018 paper, “Fusion Neutronics Experiments for Thorium Assemblies”, By Rong Liu.“D-T” is physics shorthand for “deuterium - tritium”, substances commonly used in various types of thermonuclear weapons. At least some WWII German research and development was certainly moving in this direction. The Germans are also known to have been interested in thorium as bomb fuel by way of the thorium to proactinium to U-233 decay chain.William Pellas's answer to How close did Nazi Germany come to creating an operational nuclear weapon during WWII? Would they have been able to use it on their V2 rockets?If we allow for the possibility that certain superdense elements or substances can serve as triggers for fusion bombs—as is claimed in some sources—then it may be that the purpose of the Bell was to make Xerum 525 itself. In any case it seems most likely that the mysterious NaziCherry red and very dangerousA Suggested Schematic for a Red Mercury Fusion Bomb. This Type of Weapon May Have Been Pursued by WWII German Nuclear Scientists.Witkowski states in the video above that Walter Gerlach—who was definitely one of the greatest German scientists of that era—was the main theoretical scientist who was working on Die Glocke. The infamous Austrian scientist Ronald Richter was also said to have been involved with The Bell, which would seem to point to an attempt at utilizing some kind of exotic approach to nuclear fusion involving extremely high temperatures. Plasma physics would be a natural offshoot of this sort of methodology. It is known that both Gerlach and Richter were major figures in the German Army’s clandestine nuclear weapons project, which was run through theRonald Richter, Genius or Nut?More on the Value of Ronald Richter’s WorkFusion EnergyIcarus Interstellar, Interstellar flight, | Icarus InterstellarThe Huemul ProjectDr. Freidwardt WinterbergDr. Ronald RichterSources vary as to whether one or perhaps as many as four “Bells” were completed. One was allegedly airlifted to Argentina at war’s end, and it is claimed that this is confirmed by declassified Argentine documents—though others say no such documents exist.Again, there are tantalizing traces, hints, and documentary fragments, but definitive answers as to The Bell’s purpose are still elusive and firm conclusions are not possible given the sparse testimony in the historical record which has come to light thus far.

A French-Canadian who saw action in the Normandy landings, Leo began his military career byDuring an early-morning reconnaissance mission at the Battle of the Scheldt, he spotted a German contingent in a village, most of them asleep. A typical soldier would have returned to report to a superior, but for a guy like Leo, this was an opportunity. He captured the German commander, and after killing a few soldiers, the entire company of 93 menBut Leo’s greatest feat was still to come. In April 1945, the Canadians were tasked with liberating the Dutch city of Zwolle. They planned to bombard the German positions with artillery until they surrendered. Leo was once again sent on a reconnaissance mission, this time with a friend. His superiors really should’ve known better. Realizing that an artillery barrage would also kill innocent civilians, Leo and his buddy Willie decided to liberate the city all by themselves. Unfortunately, around midnight, Willie was shot and killed. Enraged, Leo grabbed his friend’s weapon and gunned down two Germans, with the others fleeing in terror. He then proceeded to capture a different German vehicle and forced the driver to bring him to an enemy officer at a nearby tavern. Leo then informed the surprised officer that the town was surrounded by an overwhelming Canadian force and that an attack was imminent, before strolling out of the tavern and disappearing into the night.The next step was to convince the Germans that what he had told the officer was true. Leo spent the rest of the night racing around the town, gunning down Nazis and throwing grenades like a one-man army. After seeing their comrades gunned down by a mad Canadian in an eyepatch, most enemy soldiers made the smart choice and surrendered. As the night wore on, Leo kept appearing at the Allied lines with groups of confused German prisoners—before returning to the city. His final feat was to clear out the local SS headquarters. By 4:00 AM, the Germans had abandoned the town. The artillery attack was cancelled, the city saved by a single man.Leo received numerous medals for his deeds in World War II and earned even more in Korea.

Germanys Stuka Dive Bombers were notorious for the terrifying shriek they made as they fell on their targets, the RAF's midnight carpet bombing of Axis cities caused untold civilian casualties, and it was the decimation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by U.S. dropped nuclear bombs that helped to finally end the war.As with any new technology, people were eager to see what aerial bombing could do. One of those people was Barnes Wallis.Wallis was British, a very clever engineer, and a ruthless strategist. When he saw the potential aerial bombing could have on German infrastructure, he set his sights on a target lots of people thought of as invulnerable: dams.Not only did dams provide water and hydroelectric for thousands of Germans, if the British could take them out the resulting deluge would cause massive amounts of damage far exceeding that of any bombs at the time.There was one problem though. The Germans knew what a tantalizing target their dams made, and so reinforced all major dams with heavy stockades of anti-torpedo netting.Remember, this was still in the early stages of ariel bombing, guided missiles were a thing of the future, and the current tech was not near accurate enough to hit the side of a dam without using a torpedo dropped way out in front of it.But Wallis had a plan. If he couldn't send the bomb plunging downEverything needed to go perfectly for this thing to work, and so the British Government hired a Civil engineering firm to find out exactly how big a bomb has to be in order to take down a dam. Turns out that 2 tons of Compact RDX and TNT will do the job as long as it explodes right up against the dam.So how do you get something that big to skip? Wallis designed a cylindrical bomb that would get twisted into a backspin before being released low and fast. The bomb would use the Magnus effect, which is the lift created by rapidly spinning objects, to keep momentum even after the first skip. The backspin would also keep it stable enough to skip straight down the line and the velocity of spin and approach could be adjusted to an accurate range.Of course, precision was key if the bombing was going to be successful. And because you can’t really use the trial and error method during a raid, the pilots needed a way to tell exactly when and where to release the payload.The testing began over Chesil beach in England. With a constant speed of spin (500rpm) on the bomb, the problem of determining the altitude of release had to be worked out. This was solved, like so many problems are, using good old geometric triangles ∆ Two searchlights were mounted on the belly of the bomber at such angles that their beams converged on the water below only when at the right altitude of release. This was as simple as it was practical as the raid was planned to take place under the cover of darkness.(Anonymous art showing searchlight method)The second problem of determining the range of release used a similar concept. By this time the target dams had already been chosen. They were Möhne, Edersee, and Sorpe, three vitally important dams in the northern Rhineland of Germany that had been scouted and photographed by Allied reconnaissance aircraft. Using these images, Walis designed custom bombsights that, when at the correct range, would line up with unique features of each dam (likely the flak towers) and in doing so signal the time of release.Finally, after months of testing on reservoirs throughout England, and the training of an elite mission force, it was time to see if the thing actually worked.(Walis and others watch a testing run in Kent)On the night of May 16, 1943, 3 waves of 19 total Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, each fit with a Skipping Dambuster, took off from RAF Scampton in England.(Art by Pat Speirs)It was a long and treacherous flight, especially in the dark. The first casualties were taken down by flak over the Northern coast of the Netherlands, two more planes crashed into powerlines, and one plane had its bomb ripped off by a rogue swell while skimming over the north sea, with that, the entire first wave of bombers was destroyed.The second wave fared better, but, when the first bomb was sent spinning towards Möhne dam, it blew up prematurely and did little or no damage. The second bomb was either dropped to late or, too fast, and went skipping clear over the dam where it absolutely annihilated an unsuspecting powerhouse on the far side.Finally, after the third bomb was sent spinning hopelessly off course, the fourth one skipped, sunk, and blew up right against the dam. The hit weakened the dam and, invigorated by this success, the next bomber, piloted by David Maltby, dropped low, released his payload, and climbed as the bomb skipped, sunk, and blew apart Möhne dam.(Art by Robert Taylor)(Actual destruction of Möhne dam)The aircraft then continued to Edersee dam, which took three bombs before finally breaching.(Edersee Dam before)(Edersee Dam after)The remaining aircraft then took runs over Sorpe dam. But the approach turned out to be difficult and dangerous, and when the surviving bombers finally turned for home, Sorpe stood solid.When the raid was done, only 11 of the original 19 Lancasters made it back to base, and 56 men were lost.Nevertheless, the mission was seen as an undeniable success for the Allied powers. The resulting floods from the collapse of Möhne and Eder, damaged or destroyed literally dozens of German bridges, factories, and mines. Acres and acres of farmland along with an estimated 1500 people were drowned. Production and transportation for the war effort were crippled, and huge amounts of German workers and resources had to be diverted as the dams were frantically rebuilt over the next 5 months.This answer has definitely gone on long enough, but if you want to learn more go watch:Edit: Thanks to the commenters who added info or pointed out mistakes :)∆∆∆",122 followers,Steve Young,577,330,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-top-secret-German-weapon-to-end-World-War-2-Wunderwaffe-known-as-Die-Glocke-ever-actually-produced

Before the deployment of VT fuses, it would take on average 2500 shells to drop one aircraft.The proximity fuse on the other handThis technology eliminated both the need for accurate position estimation and the need for a direct contact. You could now just fire your shells towards the general vicinity of your target and they would automatically explode when they were close enough.The proximity fuse was instantly an order of magnitude more effective than other types of fuses.They were widely deployed by the US Navy in the Pacific, forming a strong defence against Kamikaze attacks and an effective offensive weapon during the island hopping campaign.The British used them in the defence of the homeland.Interestingly, it was in fact the British who invented the technology. Who later transferred it to the Americans along with dozens of other, some of them war defining, technologies with the Tizard Mission.The proximity fuse was deemed so crucial to the Allied war effort that for a good long time they were only used in places where their capture was not a possibilityAll in all some 22 million proximity fuses had been built by 1945, helping change the tide of the war decisively in the Allies' favour.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,6.2K,7.8K,406.3M,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-top-secret-German-weapon-to-end-World-War-2-Wunderwaffe-known-as-Die-Glocke-ever-actually-produced

You can’t armour the whole plane, because of weight, so it was incredibly important that the armour went in the right place.As McNamara told the story, one of the guys on the team, a Jewish mathematician named Abraham Wald (who had been thrown out of Austria because of Nazi anti-semitism), discussed the project with an armourer who’d been shipped back from overseas, who was helping the design team with the armour kits.The armourer told Wald the project was all wrong; that he’s seen planes fly home with damage in all the areas they were armouring. Then Wald had a eureka moment - he drew a diagram of the bomber, and ruled out every area where a plane had come home with a bullet hole in that part.The diagram was stark - no plane had ever come home with damage in certain angles of the cockpit (where a bullet would kill both pilots) or at the base of the vertical stabiliser.Wald had realised thatThey changed the armour, and crew survival rates shot up.McNamara told the story to make a point about data - he said had they just followed the data, it would have led them to armour the places the plane could survive a hit & get back, not the places that would always bring the aircraft down if they were shattered.He was saying that there’s nothing wrong with anecdotal evidence; that qualitative data is as relevant as quantitative, even if it’s harder to collate or analyse.",0 followers,Dylan Owens,4.8K,271,26.8M,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-top-secret-German-weapon-to-end-World-War-2-Wunderwaffe-known-as-Die-Glocke-ever-actually-produced
12,"It was not “a small bomb” that was tested near the end of WWII, but rather a pair of larger strategic nuclear weapon prototypes that were loaded with a small amount of U-235 fissile material.The best article in the public realm that I have seen is Mark Walker and Rainer Karlsch’s piece, “New Light on Hitler’s Bomb”. Published in the 1 July 2005 edition ofIt was not “a small bomb” that was tested near the end of WWII, but rather a pair of larger strategic nuclear weapon prototypes that were loaded with a small amount of U-235 fissile material.The best article in the public realm that I have seen is Mark Walker and Rainer Karlsch’s piece, “New Light on Hitler’s Bomb”. Published in the 1 July 2005 edition ofWalker and Karlsch write:More surprising, if not shocking, is another revelation in RK’s book (that is, Hitler’s Bombe—WP): a group of scientists under Diebner built and tested a nuclear weapon with the strong support of both Walther Gerlach – an experimental nuclear physicist who by 1944 was in charge of the uranium project for the Reich Research Council. (Hahn, Heisenberg, von Weizsäcker and most of the better-known scientists in the uranium project apparently were not informed about this weapon.) This device was designed to use fission reactions, but it was not an “atomic” bomb like the weapons used against Nagasaki and Hiroshima (figures 1a and b). And although it was also designed to exploit fusion reactions, it was nothing like the “hydrogen” bombs tested by the US and the Soviet Union in the 1950s.Instead, conventional high explosives were formed into a hollow shape, rather than a solid mass, to focus the energy and heat from the explosion to one point inside the shell (figure 1c). Small amounts of enriched uranium, as well as a source of neutrons, were combined with a deuterium-lithium mixture inside the shell. This weapon would have been more of a tactical than a strategic weapon, and could not have won the war for Hitler in any case. It is not clear how successful this design was and whether fission and fusion reactions were provoked. But what is important is the revelation that a small group of scientists working in the last desperate months of the war were trying to do this.As will be seen shortly, the two authors were mistaken about the intended use of the new German weapon. The reason that the blast yields in the tests were relatively low was not that these were intended as battlefield nukes but rather 1) the Germans were trying to conserve their limited supply of fissile material, and 2) the tests were done not far from populated areas in Thuringia and the Army Weapons Bureau wanted to minimize any radiation risk to nearby citizens. It is of course a measure of the desperation of the German strategic situation in the early spring of 1945 that they proceeded with these tests in that location at all.Encyclopedia Britannica Map Showing the German State of Thuringia.In November of 1944, Soviet spies were made aware of a pending live test of a German nuclear weapon.

The explosions are supposed to take place in a wooded area. For that, special roads to the presumptive test site are being created. The bomb to be tested has a diameter of one and a half meters. It consists of several hollow spheres that nest inside each other. It will be brought to the explosion place with a transporter specially constructed for it. It is still unclear when the test is supposed to take place, but the preparations are going at the maximum fastest pace.CONCLUSION.

Archive of the President of the Russian Federation, 93-81 (45) 37.Peoples’ Commissariat of Defense of the USSRReport:Our trustworthy source from Germany reports:“The Germans have in recent times carried out two large-capacity bomb explosions in Thuringia. The explosions took place in a forest area, under conditions of strictest secrecy. Trees fell at a distance of 500–600 meters from the center of the explosion. Buildings and fortifications specially constructed for the tests have been destroyed.Prisoners of war who were near the epicenter of the explosion died, often without leaving a trace. Prisoners of war who were in the area beyond the center of the explosion have burns on their face and body, the strength of which depends on their position in relation to the epicenter of the explosion. The tests were carried out in a remote deserted area. The regime of secrecy at the test site was at maximum level. Entrance and exit from the territory are by special pass only. SS soldiers have surrounded the area of tests and interrogated any person approaching the area.The bomb, supposedly filled with uranium 235 and weighing approximately two tons, was brought to the test site on a specially constructed truck. Dewars of liquid oxygen were delivered together with it. The bomb was permanently guarded by 20 guards with dogs. The bomb explosion was accompanied by a large explosive wave and high temperature. In addition, a massive radioactive effect was observed. The bomb is a sphere with a diameter of 130 cm.The bomb consists of:Initiator or bomb fuse.Consists of a special tube, which creates fast neutrons. It is charged by special generators, which create high voltage inside the tube. As a result, fast neutrons attack active material.Active bomb material.Active bomb material is uranium 235. It represents a sphere with an opening into which an initiator is inserted. Once this is done, the opening is sealed by a cork made of uranium 235.Protective casing.The uranium sphere is encased in a protective aluminum casing, which is covered by a layer of cadmium. This significantly slows down thermal neutrons emanating from uranium 235, which can cause premature detonation.Explosive matter.After the layer of cadmium it is placed inside explosives that consist of porous TNT saturated with liquid oxygen; TNT is made up of bars of a specially chosen shape. The inner surface of the bars has a spherical curvature, which is the same as that of the external surface of the cadmium layer. Each of the bars is supplied with one detonator or two electrical fuses.Casing.TNT is covered by a protective layer made of a light aluminum alloy. A blasting mechanism is attached on top of this casing.Exterior casing.An exterior casing of armored steel is installed above the blasting mechanism.Fairing.A fairing made of a light alloy can be installed on top of the armored casing for future installation on a rocket of the V-type.Bomb assembly.The sphere, which consists of metal uranium, is placed inside a protective casing, which consists of aluminum, covered in a layer of cadmium, so that the opening in the sphere coinciding with the opening is sealed off by a uranium cork. After this the aluminum sphere, covered in cadmium, is sealed off by a cork, on top of which the last bar of TNT is placed. Next, liquid oxygen is pumped through the opening inside a protective casing, which covers the TNT. After this the bomb is ready for deployment.Bomb ignition.The bomb ignition is carried out with the help of a high-voltage discharge tube. It forms a flow of neutrons, which attack the active material. When the flow of neutrons impacts upon uranium, element 93 fissions, which speeds up the creation of a chain reaction Next, the detonating mechanism detonates the explosive matter, after which a shock from the explosion of the external layer of TNT mixed with liquid oxygen takes place, which is directed toward the center. This allows the uranium to reach a critical mass.Ahead of this, before the explosion, the uranium sphere is irradiated with gamma-rays, the energy of which does not exceed 6 million electron volts, which many times increases its explosive qualities.CONCLUSION.Without doubt, the Germans are carrying out tests of a bomb of high destructive force. In the event of their successful conclusion and production of such bombs in sufficient quantities, they will have weapons capable of slowing down our advanceHead of Chief Intelligence Department of the Red ArmySoviet Dictator Josef Stalin, Left, and Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Right, Were Two of Just Four (4) People Who Were Given Copies of a Pair of Late War Red Army Intelligence Reports Concerning the Development and Testing of German Nuclear Weapons.Here it should be noted that according to former MIT scientist Dr. Todd Rider’s analysis of the Thuringia weapon, it was in fact able to function with varying amounts of fissile material. With a full load, about 10 kg, in its core, the highly efficient fusion-boosted fission method of detonation and other aspects of its design would have given it a maximum firepower of 100 kilotons—more than 4 times as much as the Allied Fat Man.From Page 1491 in Dr. Rider’s book,“Table 8.4: Comparison of the U.S. Gadget/Fat Man implosion design (from unclassified sources) with extrapolated design parameters of the March 1945 Thuringian device (Section D.4.4).The explosive yield of the German design was highly dependent on how much fission and fusion fuel were used. The component masses for the Thuringian device in Table 8.4 add up to a total mass of approximately 2000 kg, in excellent agreement with what Ilyichev and Schumann reported. Thus the German bomb had a total deployed mass less than half that of the first U.S. fission bombs (4670 kg for Fat Man), yet could have had a comparable or even greater yield. It took the United States several years to reduce the size and mass of fission bombs. According to Ilyichev and numerous other sources (p. 4137), the German bomb was designed to be launched on a rocket; the United States was not prepared to do that until 1958 (after extensive help from hundreds of German-speaking scientists and engineers it had acquired).”From pg. 1497:“The explosive yield of the Thuringian device would have strongly depended on how much fission and fusion fuel were used.Werner Grothmann, who was Heinrich Himmler’s chief adjutant in the SS for most of the war years, spoke about the Thuringia tests shortly before his death in 2002. In a lengthy interview he gave to his neighbor, Wolf Krotzky, Grothmann stated that:The test was carried out directly there, even though that was in an inhabited area, because due to the course of the war we did not have a lot of choice and, of course, because time was also critical. So we just stayed where the necessary material was produced and stored. In addition, our people and those of Diebner’s other group had their laboratories and the development department. And here close by, too, the mass production of uranium bombs had been planned. In addition, at the beginning of January, the ignition [system] production or at least the development of an ignition system intended for the uranium bomb was likewise supposed to be relocated here, according to my memory. But this was placed in an abandoned mine, not in one of the facilities on site. Diebner allegedly assured that the explosive effect would be quite small for the small amount [of fuel] that the test would require. Unfortunately his prediction was not confirmed. What happened there was horrible. In addition, there were other consequences in the surrounding area, of which I only heard, that doctors, who were under contract with us, had to be deployed there.Grothmann also said unequivocally that at least one, evidently only partially complete serial production version of this bomb was captured by US ground forces when they overran the area several weeks later.Page 3555 inFor this, however, I can vouch myself: Parts of the material had been removed from our research and development laboratories in Thuringia, but not everything. Why this happened, I do not know.Dr. Rider:“In the first three quoted paragraphs, Grothmann told how German engineers successfully invented one or more detonation timing systems to allow the spherical implosion bomb (which he described elsewhere) to create a detonation with “millimeter-exact” accuracy across all of the ignition points around the bomb. He stated that at least one of those ignition systems was a sophisticated optical method using infrared detonators. This description sounds remarkably similar to the technology that Heinz Schlicke may have transferred to the United States from the U-234 submarine’s cargo.”This has long been rumored and there is almost total silence on the world wide web about Schlicke’s expertise in precision bomb fusing such as was used in both the German and US-Allied versions of nuclear implosion bombs. Note the following mention of the same or similar technology in Geoffrey Brooks’“A crucial question is whether Germany had an effective implosion fuse in 1939. It is claimed that they were close to it, and by 1941 had made such advances in the technology of implosion fuses that they were already working on the ultra-violet type. Sources allege that an efficient implosion fuse which could set off all detonators around the bomb sphere at the speed of light was invented by Prof. (Ing) Friedrich Lachner in Vienna pre-war and a model exhibited at the Wiener Technische Hochschule (University) to a gathering of home and foreign physicists at a lecture evening.”Werner GrothmannHeinz Schlicke As He Appeared Later in LifeDr. Rider continues his analysis on pg. 3556:“Adlerhorst or Eagle’s Nest was located near Bad Nauheim, and should not be confused with the better known Eagle’s Nest or Kehlsteinhaus near Berchtesgaden. Adlerhorst was captured by the U.S. Army on 30 March 1945, and subsequently was used by the Allies as “Operation Dustbin” to imprison and interrogate high-value German intelligence targets, including Albert Speer, Wernher von Braun, and many others. If the United States captured German atomic bomb components and immediately took them to Adlerhorst, those components could have been captured no earlier than April 1945. Since the United States could have taken the components to many other sites that were equally or more secure, Grothmann’s statement that they were taken to Adlerhorst suggests that those components were shown to high-value German detainees so that they could not deny the existence of the German nuclear program. Furthermore, that would suggest that the United States had not captured a satisfactory amount of information about the nuclear program, and was desperate to learn more from the detainees. Is it possible to locate and declassify any U.S. records on what German atomic bomb components were found, or what the United States learned from German detainees? See p. 3546 for a very incomplete list of some German and Austrian nuclear-related scientists and engineers who temporarily visited or permanently moved to the United States or United Kingdom after the war, just as Grothmann said.”For Further Reading:",0 followers,Jeremy Joyner,1.1K,1.1K,6M,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-top-secret-German-weapon-to-end-World-War-2-Wunderwaffe-known-as-Die-Glocke-ever-actually-produced

The Indians used them against the British in the 1700s, and the British stole the idea to use against the Americans in the War of 1812 — “…And the ""rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,” of the Star-Spangled Banner.(Above: 150mm German Nebelwerfer rocket launchers firing on the Eastern Front, Kursk, July 1943. But the smoke was a give-away to enemy hunter battery fire or ground attack aircraft.)IMO, the WWII German rocket artillery had in a way taken over from the German Ju 87 Stuka dive-bomber as the main destroyer of Allied soldier’s morale. With both, nerve-wracking, whistling, screaming, moaning shrieks were followed by violent explosions of bombs and shells…it was the horrific screaming noise that terrified soldiers into abandoning their positions, and the explosions that killed them as they ran. “Jericho Trumpets” were now exchanged for 210mm “Screaming Mimi’s” or ""Moaning Minnies.” And they were very effective against Allied soldiers, including in Normandy.Initially smoke screen launchers, the Germans used a series of rocket launchers in 150mm and 210mm, similar to the Soviet Katyusha, ""Little Kate,"" or “Stalin’s Organs” on the Eastern Front that could be so devastating to their own units, and while they had versions since the. beginning, they chose to redesign/upgrade their own, making them more lethal, but never produced them on a s Cale as the Soviets did.. The 28 cm and 32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 shells and many similar projectiles were fired from everything from their packing cases to armoured half-tracks, all very economical and were the forerunners in some ways of today’s Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS). For some reason they are hardly mentioned in discussions about WWII today, although they were extensively used during the war on both Fronts and many Allied troops used to shudder at the memory of the “Moaning Minnies.”WWII German artillery doctrine saw their artillery, including the rocket launchers, as a support platform, an organic component of the infantry that helped suppress enemy activity and reduce strong points. The Soviet WWII doctrine saw the artillery, including the rocket launchers, as an offensive tool, joining infantry support with saturation bombardment of an enemy-held position. The Soviet doctrine was the superior.(Above: Thanks to some “encouragement” by the Soviets, the Nebelwerfer rocket batteries had become an established part of the army artillery system by late 1942, and the Panzer formations decided they needed their own dedicated rocket units. Most Nebelwerfer units used towed launchers, so in order to keep up with the Panzers a self-propelled version was required. The halftrack was the obvious choice as a starting point, but as none could be allocated the Maultier truck was first pressed into use, making something similar to the “Stalin’s Organs.” But later in the war a half-tracked launcher was issued. This was the 15-cm Panzerwerfer 42 which continued to use the 15-cm (5.9-in) rocket two horizontal rows of five )They had success with 150mm and 210mm rockets and the 150mm had an effective range of 7500 yards and the 210mm had an effective range of 8500 yards, or aprox. half the range of an 88mm Flak 18/36 antitank gun. The 150mm projective weighted 34kg.The most basic Nebelwerfer could launch 6–12 rockets in a salvo, Salvo time was 4 seconds, and it could be reloaded in less than three minutes. There were three to six nebelwerfer in a battery, each with six to twelve tubes, with 18–72 tubes firing within seconds to saturate an area. When these things hit, even with iffy accuracy, they would devastate an area, and besides the physical damage, the psychological damage was extensive. Morale of a unit could be in tatters after a rocket attack.The launchers were so light and easy to haul any machine even horses. They didn't even need a heavy battery, but fired off a magneto.(Above: Nebelwerfer were light, mobile, and fairly simple compared to howitzers. But, they also suffered from poor accuracy, and the smoke trails disclosed firing locations to Allied aircraft and artillery. I knew some old P-47 pilots of the 9th Air Force that esp. keyed on the smoke trails they left and “bet” they could arrive to hit the launchers and crews with eight .50s, bombs and rockets before they could pack up and ski-daddle. It was a continuous “race” they held. Counter-battery fire, was always coming, too.)(Above: Of all of Hitler’s “wonder Weapons,” these rocket launchers came the closest to living up to their hype: incredibly cheap, mobile, reliable, working under the most adverse conditions, required very little training to use and had devastating firepower if not great accuracy. Its drawbacks were relatively short range, the distinctive and tale-tell trails of smoke and the expensive ammunition.)(Above: Nicknamed ""Moaning Minnie"" by US soldiers because of the sound it made.)Throughout the war the Germans kept upgrading them, with increased power and range, finally creating six different versions, and Allied soldier's dreaded their attacks even more than mortar “stonks” or regular artillery barrages, as the 155 and 210mm shells hit so much area, all at the same time, with such destructive shells, there was no escape.(Above: Designed, like the “Little Kate” for saturation attacks, not accuracy, the Germans made about 87,000 smaller Nebelwefer tube launchers the Soviets made about 10,000 of the larger, truck-mounted, rail-launched “Stalin’s Organs.” The Germans even tried told design air-to-air rockets to take out bombers but not much came from that.Which was more effective? The Soviet rockets, by far, for in their greater inaccuracy they saturated an area with far more, very high powered shells, noise, white hot propellent and shattered German morale.Thanks!",437 followers,Matthew Moore,647,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-top-secret-German-weapon-to-end-World-War-2-Wunderwaffe-known-as-Die-Glocke-ever-actually-produced

Most battles lasted weeks or, occasionally, months - the Battle of the Atlantic lasted five years, from Britain's entry into the war in September 1939 until the German surrender in May 1945.The Battle of the Atlantic involved no ground forces. It was a battle of willpower, determination, technological advancement, code-breaking and strategy. It was not fought over hills or cities, but over a million square miles of stormy ocean. There were no pitched battles or squadron actions, but more than a thousand single-ship encounters and over 100 convoy battles that collectively decided the course of the war.Victory in the Battle of the Atlantic, or at least the avoidance of defeat, was a prerequisite for pushing back the Nazis in every theatre. The convoys that sailed from Canada and the USA went to supply food and resources to Britain, helping to keep it in the war. Ships carried material that was necessary for D-Day, equipment that was vital for the defence of Moscow, Stalingrad and Leningrad, and even Prime Ministers and Presidents.Although most of the action came at sea, most of the vital work was done in Britain, in places such as the Admiralty in London and in Bletchley Park. It was here that strategies were decided on, Ultra was developed and the Enigma code was cracked - it was here, in many ways, that the war was won.The Battle of the Atlantic was also one of the greatest displays of co-ordination between the air and naval forces in the war. The Swordfish and Sunderland aircraft with Coastal Command did a great deal to spare the Royal Navy the task of endless searches for submarines. The work of Coastal Command is often overlooked, as Fighter Command’s work in the Battle of Britain and Bomber Command’s work over ‘Fortress Europe’ are considered more vital, but in many ways Coastal Command was the most important of the three RAF branches.Similarly, World War Two is often considered a bad time in the history of the Royal Navy. There were no great clashes of battleships as in the First World War. The Royal Navy did not sweep all before them without losing a ship as in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no great battles to sing about such as the Saintes or Quiberon Bay.But that misses the successes of the Battle of the Atlantic. Every U-boat sunk, every convoy that reached Britain - these were all victories, and the Royal Navy had more of them in World War Two than at any other point in history. It was not battleships or aircraft carriers that won the Battle of the Atlantic - it was the destroyers, and their crews.The sacrifice of the sailors and airmen in the Battle of the Atlantic cannot be overstated. 72,200 sailors were killed on cold mornings and in stormy nights while sailing across the bleak ocean. Almost half of them were civilians. It is a stark reminder that war is not just fought by soldiers. War, particularly a war as total as that of the Second World War, is a terrible burden on civilians, and they would not be spared by their underwater enemies.In the air, some 721 aircraft were lost in anti-submarine sorties. Some were intercepted by enemy fighters. Some flew into storms and never flew out. Some got lost, and simply flew on and on over an endless ocean before running out of fuel and drowning in the sea.It’s a measure of how vital the battle was that, although Allied losses more than twice that of the Axis, there has never been any suggestion of an Axis victory. The continual victory in the Battle of the Atlantic allowed Britain to be supplied with food and fuel. It allowed fresh American forces to reinforce the tired British forces. The logistical and strategic powers that victory gave the Allies allowed them to land in Tripoli and mop up the North African theatre, before crossing the strait into Italy. It allowed the Soviets to survive when they were desperately fighting for their survival in front of Moscow, and it allowed the greatest naval operation in history to go ahead.Just as in World War One, victory in the Battle of the Atlantic was the only hope the Germans had for defeating Britain and winning their war.

Before you point to wind, hydro or solar I remind you that humans are using the secondary energy resources of that big old fusion ball in the sky (Sun) which is burning hydrogen into helium.Direct forms of burning stuff is fuels like wood, coal and oil. The next level of our ability to burn things is burning individuals atoms by splitting them, fission reactors can, theoretically, produce vast quantities of energy, far more than chemical burning of stuff (oil coal/natural gas).TheOther than figuring out how to make a warp bubble, which there is interesting work being done in that line, See:What prevents massive space ships from being launched from Earth’s surface at this time is we have to overcome the 9.8 m/s^2 or 32 feet/s^2 gravitational pull of earth. Since we are only burning chemicals with tiny amounts of energy conversion we rely on Space-X and Saturn V giant rockets that are mostly fuel tanks and engines, with a few hundred tons of pay load.Fission has been proposed with little in the way of what do we do with the radioactive crater left behind when the ship launches. Fusion has been proposed but frankly other than hydrogen bombs (Both Fusion and Fission would enable humans to travel within days and weeks inside the inner solar system (inside Jupiter’s orbit) and within months to as far away as the Pluto formally known as planet.While proposals for building super sized interstellar crossing ships have been put out there, the closest star system,The most efficient fuel source we can think of is the conversion of 100% matter into energy. The only way we know how this can be done with 100% certainty is the annihilation of matter with equal amounts of antimatter.AntimatterWithout the ability to warp space travel between the stars would still take long periods of time. The best we could hope to achieve is around 80% the speed of light. By that speed the crew are reaping the rewards of time dilation with the fuel/energy expenditure falling within acceptable levels.This is called “Relativistic Speeds” where time slows down, distances decrease and mass grows larger. Mind to the crew the rest of the universe is going faster while to them all is tick-tocking away at a steady tick per second as a second onboard the vessel will be a second. To those outside looking at the craft, the crew members are slowing down and aging slowly.This comes in handy if we are sending one way missions to far away exo-planets where we plan to colonize. The colonists would be able to get there in a reasonable ship board time. Although the longer they travel at those speeds the more time passes on earth.Now we know that Relativistic Speeds are a non-issue on Star Trek. Time on board ships and on planets is the same. IDK how they managed it.Perhaps a property of warping space? If so then we have to wait a wee bit longer until we can harvest and use dark energy.We are at the manipulate nuclear energy stage. We have already created and captured tiny amounts of anti-matter. During the rest of this century we will most likely fine tune our ability to use anti-matter. Mind TPTB want to store anti-matter and make bombs out of it. Typical? Yeah. However creating and immediately using anti-particles may become a way for space engines to effectively convert fusion into ‘rockets’.Estimated time of arrival on Antimatter propulsion 2100 to 2150.

You want to understand why so late, right?And I'll be explaining the why below.So what is needed for interstellar travel?A spaceship! Obviously.But what do we need to make that ship a true ark to send us to the stars?— First and foremost we need power. Nuclear power!And we need it to be powerful, safe, and which fuel can preferably be easily obtained and stored.The best candidate by far is Nuclear Fusion.Nuclear Fission simply doesn't provide enough power. And storing and using the fuel necessary can be tricky to say the least. Especially because of the radioactivity.Antimatter would be ideal for propulsion, but any failure in the containment of antimatter could spell the end of the ship and everyone on board, in a heartbeat.So Nuclear Fusion it has to be, until something better is discovered.— After getting Nuclear Fusion to work we'll need to scale down the reactor. So it can he used in a spaceship, and not occupy too much space.In order to scale it down, we'll need room temperature superconductors.And to get room temperature superconductors, we'll need nanotechnology to get them.— Room temperature superconductors will also be necessary if we want to have nuclear propulsion.If we want to have a form of plasma propulsion powered by the Fusion Reactors, then we'll need superconductive technology.With that kind of technology we can make the ship easily reach at least 50% the speed of light. Which would be the ideal travel speed for slower than light travel.— We'll also need nanotechnology to develop the necessary metamaterials.Metamaterials that can more effectively handle damage and block off radiation.— Suspended animation or hybernation technology.Let's face it. If you want to send enough people to another planet then the best way for them to make that trip is if most of the crew is put into a temporary sleep.With the necessary operational crew rotation, so as to not have mental breakdowns or other issues.If the entire crew was kept awake, then the food supplies requirements alone, might not be enough to make the trip.Not unless we can create 3D printers, that can print food. Which would be the ideal in case of hybernation not being an option.— Artificial gravity through use of centrifugal force, is easy to do. And we would need it, if we want to be able to land on the planet we are heading.— Another important key piece of technology that needs to be invented, is to create an entire new type of telescope that worked more like a spacial scanner.Why is it necessary? Why wouldn't regular telescopes serve the purpose needed?You see, the closest solar system at 50% the speed of light, would still take us nearly 9 years to get there.So if the planet we are aiming for is already showing signs of problems, for human colonization, then there's really no point going there. Is there?The optimal scenario would be that we have spacial scanners, that would allow us to retrieve and analyze information bypassing the limits of the speed of light.Which may be possible through use of Quantum Mechanics.Still even without it, we could still make the trip. Only like so many things in life, it may be a trip leading to a dead end.— Faster than light communications would also be ideal. But again… Not strictly necessary.After all once the ship got far enough into outerspace, no help could ever be sent in time to do anything about it.So the checklist is this:And this is it.Once we have all of this then we can venture into the stars.","30,850 followers",Ken Miyamoto,1.7K,5.8K,91.2M,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-we-not-get-Nuclear-Fusion-to-work-effectively
31,"Nuclear fusion is safer than nuclear fission. Why?Because nuclear fusion has no chain reaction involved.In nuclear fission you basically shoot neutrons at heavy atoms, thus breaking them apart, which frees energy which can be used e.g. to heat water and produce electricity via a dynamo. But, and that is the point here, it also frees neutrons which again break others atoms, again freeing energy and neutrons and so on. Uncontrolled this chain reaction can produce enormous amounts of energy in a very short time.

That’s basically what happens when a nuclear bomb is detonated or if a nuclear plant gets out of control.In nuclear fusion however you have to have to push light atoms together e.g. with magnetic fields until they fuse together, which also frees energy. For energy to be freed, you have to keep up the pressure. If there is a malfunction and the magnetic fields collapse, the reaction simply stops. No chain reaction, no enormous amounts of energy, no catastrophe.","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-we-not-get-Nuclear-Fusion-to-work-effectively
32,"Because the amount of fuel locked up in a fusion reactor is one or two second’s worth of energy generation. So in the most catastrophic imaginable accident, the energy and volume of reaction products released into the environment is small enough that it will only affect the reactor site. Whereas a fission reactor has about ten years worth of fuel in it, gradually growing more and more toxic over time.

There will be some radioactive waste generated by irradiation of the reactor structure, but this is not a huge volume and relatively easy to handle. Fission, by contrast, generates a vast cocktail of products with a hugely varied chemical and radiological spectrum, requiring a range of cleanup and defence mechanisms.While fusion is not totally clean and safe, it is orders of magnitude below fission in worst-case consequences.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-we-not-get-Nuclear-Fusion-to-work-effectively

There are also groups working on not using confined plasma at all, but rather inertial confinement, where the fusion happens in pulses rather than continuously.But if you want fusion and you don’t care if you put more energy in than you get out? That’s easy.

34,"Q: Nuclear fusion is safer than nuclear fission. Why?It is?If you are talking about a lab environment (really, really big labs in the case of fusion) I would say it is a wash.If you are talking about bombs, depending on your distance from the detonation, I would say it is a wash.If you are talking about power production, Fusion is far safer. Mainly because it doesn’t exist in that mode yet.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-we-not-get-Nuclear-Fusion-to-work-effectively
35,"The energy from each individual reaction is lower. But the energy per nucleon is much higher. Fusion gives 15–25 MeV for 4–6 nucleons, at about 4 MeV per nucleon, whereas fission gives about 200 MeV for 230–250 nucleons, about 1 MeV per nucleon. So for a given mass of fuel, there is about four times the specific energy,But the advantages are elsewhere. The fuel is far cheaper, and far safer to mine. The reaction can be turned on and off as needed, and has no huge mass of fuel which needs to be carefully managed, and will escape and pollute in a worst case accident.
