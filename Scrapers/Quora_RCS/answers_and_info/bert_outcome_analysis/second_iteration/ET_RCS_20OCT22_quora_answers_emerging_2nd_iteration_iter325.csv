My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

2,"As others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

3,"It doesn’t, not atom per atom. As other answers to this question point out, a typical fission reaction releases about 200 MeV of energy. (If you don’t know what MeV means, don’t worry about that for now.)A typical fusion reaction releases about 18 MeV. That’s less than 10% of the energy released by fission!However, if you have equal weights of fuel, then the energy released by fusion is greater. That’s because one atom of U-235 has a mass of 235 nuclei, whereas the mass of D + T has the mass of 5 nuclei. That’s a factor of 47 less weight.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

By the time you finish the first 50 new reactors, most of those 46 reactors will have been retired. You will have gained a little, plus the new reactors are generally larger, but you not gained that much. Essentially, after 15 years you still have nearly 350 reactors to build. In another 15 years another lot of reactors have retired. You are catching up, mostly because only one new reactor was built between 1999 and 2020, but you are not going ahead as fast as you might think.My rough calculation is that if you build an extra 10% more reactors every 15-year cycle and retire the old reactors at 60 years, you finally catch up in the year 2170 after building 800-odd new reactors.And then there is the question of cost - assuming you can do this thing fast enough to actually get more reactors built than retired and you catch up by 2170 after 800 new reactors.If you were seriously committed and eliminatedIt doesn’t add up.Moving on to nuclear fusion power, I think (without the benefit of any special knowledge or training in fusion) thatNuclear fusion power plants will likely be about the same size as existing nuclear fission power plants.

The company consists of two key people: a plasma thruster expert and an audacious internet entrepreneur. Both are pictured below [2,4]. The entrepreneur is Mike Cassidy.Mr. Cassidy is a big deal. His name alone, makes this company one to watch. Most recently, Cassidy served as an executive director, at Google. He has lead and sold off multiple companies since starting in business in early nineties [5]. In a word: he is a classic Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The man is also well connected: Tech Crunch has reported that Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google are both “super enthusiastic” about this startup [1]. The other person involved is Dr. Ben Longmier. Dr. Longmier is currently an adjunct professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan [4]. He has worked extensively, in plasma thrusters.Until April fourth 2017, I had never heard of either of these guys. They both work in different fields from traditional fusion. Whatever, we need them. The quest for fusion power needs all the help it can get.I was able to get a hold of Apollo Fusions’ patent application [7]. It was filed on September first of 2015. I would guess that Dr. Longmier spearheaded this effort - and brought Mike Cassidy in later. The companies’ approach is based on plasma thruster research. Their concept reminds me most of a virtual cathode made inside a penning trap. That idea was originally suggested by Dan Barnes, of the Los Alamos National Labs, back in 2000 [23]. In any case, the gist of it is: get a lot of electrons together and have them attract ions towards one spot. Get them moving at high enough speeds to create fusion. That sounds a lot like a polywell.Dr. Longmier is lucky to work in plasma thruster research. Indeed, they may be better understood that traditional fusion devices. Thrusters have gotten the funding, while our fusion field has languished. Your basic thruster relies on the Hall Effect. This is a well-researched topic, with it’s’ roots back into the sixties [7]. Multiple research teams have been involved in this effort, over the past five decades and Hall Thrusters have been used to circle the moon [6].A Basic Thruster:How do plasma thrusters work? They are normally tested in low pressure vacuum environment (1.3E-3 to 1.3E-6 Pascal). In the past, these thrusters sat on large satellites, but there has been a recent push into smaller, cube stats. A cube stat is a hunk of metal, 10 centimeters to a side. They represent the next generation of satellites. This change is reflected in Dr. Longmiers’ research. On paper, he is part of the University of Michigans’ Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion lab. That lab was founded in 1992 and since then, has hosted 15 or 20 big thruster experiments [9]. They were all housed inside a vast, 200 cubic meter, tank. These represent the old kind of thrusters. Dr. Longmier has pushed into smaller sizes [24]. He has focusing on cube stats. The basic mechanism of a Hall thruster is shown below [8, 6].To build a hall thruster, the first thing you need to do is set up your fields. At the center of the thruster is a ringed cavity. This is filled with both a magnetic and electric field. These fields run perpendicular, to one another. The magnetic field comes out from the center, while the electric field points out from the bottom of the cavity. The Lorentz force dictates electrons inside this cavity will mostly stay there. Once set up, you need to light your thruster. To do that, you must inject a fuel. Xenon is the most common fuel to burn. This is because it is a big fat atom that is easy to ionize. The Xenon atoms interact with the electrons and ionize. Once positive, they fly away from the positive electric field. When they leave this cavity they accelerate, pushing the satellite forward. As they fly, they suck in electrons which neutralize the beam. This makes a broad, neutral jet, pushing the satellite forward.Comparing:The biggest differences between this kind of work and traditional fusion research - is the scale of everything. For example, the magnetic fields used inside a hall thruster will only reach a few hundred guass [10]. Meanwhile, a polywell will need a field that is 80 times higher [11]. These are the kind of fundamental differences, which change everything about how you do your testing. For example, a Hall thruster could be run for several minutes, powered by batteries or the wall outlet. In stark contrast, the Lockheed fusion reactor must run off capacitors. Hence, Lockheed can only fire their machine for a few microseconds [12-14]. Another difference is the plasma temperature. Thruster plasma is tens of electronvolts, aka very cold. A typical fusor does fusion at 30,000 eletronvolts or hotter [15, 16]. That difference is stark, and it effects everything about how the plasma behaves. Finally, the fuels are very different. Xenon is easy to use. It is a noble gas, which works well in a vacuum system. Vacuum experts will tell you, you need a noble gas to push out the air in a Vacuum [26]. A fusion fuel like tritium is very different. When we worked with it at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, it was a cost, regulatory and safety hassle. If Apollo Fusion wants to burn tritium, they will need a great deal more technical staff and costs.All this being said, Dr. Longmier has a history of pushing the bounds of technology. He was part of a team that developed a 200 kilowatt rocket engine at the Ad Astra Rocket Company, in Houston [18]. As I understand it, this is an order of magnitude better than other rocket thrusters. This company is widely known in the space community, because of its’ CEO, Dr. Franklin Chang Díaz. Reaching such a high thrust means that many other plasma parameters and field strengths should rise in kind. But here is the key question: would plasmas in rockets get so good that they could start to look like fusion plasmas?The Patent:Patents are always vague. At first glance, this concept looks like: an electron jet, inside some bigger fields. At its’ core, is an electron beam. This beam runs right through the center of the machine. The idea is to get the electrons in this beam to bunch together. This, in turn, will attract the ions for fusion reactions. The patent does not mention how they plan to make this electron beam. But, they will need some solution here. If the electrons are not shoved forward with enough kick, they will be scattered by the other fields inside this machine. Fortunately, there are several off the-shelf electron beams that they can buy [19]. Once shot forward, the electrons will encounter several other fields simultaneously.Normally, I would model these fields, as I have in the past for the polywell and Lockheeds’ CFR [20, 21]. A model is very straightforward. You use excel, newtons’ equations of motions and the Lorentz force to map out how the electrons move around. If you want to get fancy, you use MATLAB or COMSOL. Regrettably, this patent gives us no hint as to the field strengths or dimensions inside this machine. The picture that they do give, is reproduced below [7].This is a very busy picture. The first thing you notice the large green field on the outside. This is supposed to be a balanced magnetic field. Ideally, this opposes the electron beam [7]. The patent promises that this magnetic should slow the electron leakage to the ring in the center. The next thing that you notice is that big red ring. That is just one big, positive voltage ring. A positive lump metal, for which the design is not finalized. The patent, in fact, covers several ring designs. The patent claims that if you pulse a voltaage on this ring, you can increase the plasma density in the electron beam by 700 fold. Where is this claim coming from? It be must from one of Dr. Longmiers’ publications.The center of that ring, is where the magic happens. This increase in beam density is suppose to pull ions in towards the center. If everything works as planned, the ions will slam together and fuse. This will generate neutrons, which will fly away and hit the walls. The patent then talks about using FLiBe, in the walls, to absorb the neutrons. FLibe is a popular molten salt which has been pushed the thorium community [22]. This would represent a fusion-fission hybrid approach.Assessment:Obviously, this patent and Apollos’ website will not reveal how far along this research is. Since the patent was filed in 2015, it is safe to say that Longmier has been looking at this problem for some years.

The fission blanket is kept subcritical so that one does not need complicated control or safety systems - at least that is the claim. Since each DT reaction will generate one or more fissions, one generates 15 or more times as much heat for each DT reaction making break even easier.Going back in time again, the joke was that if you made the fusion part of your hybrid plant vanishingly small, you would have a practical power plant.","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,2.3K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

A ship with ~50% fuel by mass, using fusion power, would have enough fuel to accelerate to 0.2–0.3 c, spend a few years or decades at that speed, then slow down at the far side. This is substantially better and more solvable than centuries or millenia. Note, 50% fuel by mass means fuel is half the mass of the ship, while the rest of the mass is everything else, from the ship itself, to engines, to consumables and crew.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

Col. Roy Horton:The (South African) military reportedly did play a leading role in coordinating clandestine arms and technology transfers between South Africa and Israel. This included the transfer of approximately 50 metric tons of South African yellowcake (uranium ore concentrate) in exchange for 30 grams of tritium to support AEC work on boosted fission weapons. Other exchanges of military technology and work on joint ventures reportedly included technical knowledge acquired from the cancelled Israeli ""Lavi"" fighter program to the South African Cheetah fighter and the joint Israeli-South African space program. The latter effort provided South Africa with a ballistic missile delivery capability using a modified Jericho II missile.The AEC scientists were relegated from a position of ""first to worst"" in terms of influence over the nuclear program. They resigned themselves to researching boosted fission weapon and implosion weapon designs for which there was no customer and no hope of increased funding.

The keys to efficiency are therefore various techniques for 1) keeping the prompt supercritical reaction (the detonation) confined for as long as possible before the bomb blows itself apart, thereby 2) increasing the numbers of neutrons striking their fissile material targets, and 3) reflecting as many escaping fast neutrons as possible back into the fissioning core in order to further augment the blast yield by prolonging and enlarging the reaction. All of this takes place in a fraction of a second.In thermonuclear bombs, the fission detonation is used to produce the enormous temperatures and X-ray emissions necessary to provoke nuclear fusion—a second “stage” in the detonation that occurs almost instantaneously with the first, or “primary” stage (the fission detonation). Additional stages can be added on to make the explosion even more powerful, though so far as is known, no one has attempted to build a weapon that utilized more than three (3) stages. According to Chuck Hansen’s extraordinary work,How Do Nuclear Weapons Work?Nuclear Weapons PrimerWhy No One Will Ever Build Another Nagasaki Type BombAre there three-stage nuclear weapons as opposed to the two-stage thermonuclear weapons?B41 nuclear bomb - WikipediaThermonuclear weapon - WikipediaDismantling the mega-nuke: America begins to take apart B53 that was 600 times more powerful than bomb that flattened HiroshimaFoam Plasma Mechanism Firing Sequence in a Thermonuclear Bomb.Diagram and Accompanying Text is Taken Verbatim From the Wikipedia Article “Thermonuclear Weapon”.Note that none of the sources above discuss Uranium-233, another fissile isotope of uranium. U-233, like plutonium, is most often produced in a reactor. It has the additional advantage of utilizing thorium-232 as its raw material, with thorium being three to four times as abundant on Earth as uranium. In recent months I have noticed the apparent disappearance from the web of articles discussing the utility of U-233 in nuclear weapons, as well as those regarding a process pioneered at Oak Ridge, TN, by Union Carbide, known as THOREX. Broadly similar to the PUREX procedure that removes impurities from reactor-produced plutonium, THOREX dates back to the 1950s and would presumably be fairly well known among nuclear chemists, physicists, engineers, weapons designers, and so on. Both the United States and the Soviet Union tested bomb designs that were powered at least in part by U-233 in the first decade and change after WWII. In addition, India is known to have used U-233 in at least one underground test detonation (the “Shakti V”) and so given that all of this is nothing new, I am at a loss as to why some information is no longer available. Note also that theLittle Boy - WikipediaThe first Manhattan Project implosion bombs utilized a series of explosive lenses that all had to be triggered simultaneously in order for the subcritical pieces of plutonium to be fired into the core so that they would detonate. It appears that at least some German nuclear weapons concepts from the Second World War likewise relied on implosion, but arrived there via shaped or hollow charge explosives rather than the more complicated lens-and-fusing system used in the US-Allied weapons. It is said in the sources I have read to date that the prototype boosted fission tactical nuclear weapons which were tested twice near Ohrdurf, Germany, in March 1945 utilized this approach. There is mention in David Irving’s bookWilliam Pellas's answer to What would’ve happened in the Second World War if National Socialist Germany had developed the Atomic Bomb first?William Pellas's answer to Why was there only two atomic bombs made?Swan (nuclear primary) - WikipediaDiagram Taken From the Wikipedia Article “Swan (Nuclear Primary)”.I have often wondered whether it might be possible to create the same or similar conditions necessary to ignite the fusion reaction in a bomb by some other means besides a fission bomb primary. This is often a goal in so-called “fourth generation” nuclear weapons research. Two mechanisms for achieving this have been suggested or alleged in the sources that I have read.

20,"Gun is just dangerous, there's a reason not many gun designs were put into production. Implosion should be more efficient, all other things being equal.But mamy other factors contribute to efficiency. Boosting, for example, is a big one. Jamming more neutrons into the critical mass at the moment the chain reaction occurs means more fission happens before the bomb disassembles itself.","5,195 followers",Ronald Kimmons,4.5K,14.1K,25.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion
21,"After World War II, Japan fully expected that since America was so militarily dominant, Japan would fall under American tyranny and become a wholly occupied territory. They expected Americans to wantonly rape Japanese women, kill or imprison Japanese men (soldiers specifically), overturn the Japanese government, and take Japan’s natural resources for the glory of the US of A. For a brief time after the war, the Japanese military was even issuing cyanide pills to young women so that they could avoid being raped and impregnated by blood-crazed American conquerors, drunk on victory.Japan was so cAfter World War II, Japan fully expected that since America was so militarily dominant, Japan would fall under American tyranny and become a wholly occupied territory. They expected Americans to wantonly rape Japanese women, kill or imprison Japanese men (soldiers specifically), overturn the Japanese government, and take Japan’s natural resources for the glory of the US of A. For a brief time after the war, the Japanese military was even issuing cyanide pills to young women so that they could avoid being raped and impregnated by blood-crazed American conquerors, drunk on victory.Japan was so certain her new American overlords would be violent, sex-mad hellfiends that the government actually opened state-sponsored brothels - specifically for the “recreational enjoyment” of Allied forces. It was the Occupation forces who declared brothels illegal a year later, stating it was undemocratic and unethical for a government to force women into such work.So, while America did in fact establish bases on mainland Japan and occupied the country for seven years, the Americans actually assisted Japan in drafting a new constitution, rebuilding their country, and did what Americans generally did in that era: carpet bombed Japan with a charm offensive. Though they had been at war extremely recently, the Japanese and Americans found they rather liked one another. While there were criminal offenses in the days directly after the end of the war, Japanese officials found that US military leaders were generally co-operative and the US military mandate for “regular order and discipline” weren’t just words on a page.Japan and America also quickly found a common enemy - the threat of the spread of Communism, which Japan had a strong distaste for even though Japan itself was only then beginning the transition from a divine monarchy to a form of democracy. Japan and America signed a peace treaty that meant America would provide security and military support for Japan. In return America gained a critical foothold in the Asia pacific within “striking distance“ of Korea and China. Given China and Japan’s rocky history, Japan was eager to have a powerful ally who was equally wary of Chinese dominance in the region.American GIs were also a large part of why the US has such good relations with its former enemies. Previously in history, the conquering armies would rape and pillage the conquered, or (later in history) at the very least conquer and plunder the losing territory. Americans had no interest in these things. Most just wanted to serve their tour of duty, drink a bit, perhaps enjoy a little romance, and then quickly get back to the United States. This attitude was a surprise to the Japanese who were used to more violent takeovers and occupations.(American GI’s fraternizing with their Japanese sweethearts…against orders, no less! Photo: BBC News)Some American GIs settled in and started learning about the people they had once fought against, as Americans generally do after almost every war. America had no real quarrel with Japan prior to World War II and wasn’t really interested in continuing the quarrel of WWII. Americans didn’t try to force a new religion or set of beliefs on Japan, they didn’t attempt to destroy the Japanese way of life or impose massive changes upon the average Japanese person. To the contrary, the Japanese found the Americans to be mostly curious about and interested in Japan. As a country, America in the post WWII era did not seem to hold many grudges nor was the US interested in “conquest” in its historical connotation.Freed from the need for military spending (among other factors) and bolstered by this new and unlikely alliance with their former enemies, Japan turned her focus to industrial development, leading to a then-unprecedented economic boom, called the “Japanese Economic Miracle”. The average national income doubled in just under ten years. America was instrumental in this as well, providing hundreds of millions per year in economic aid, and also through the spending and patronage of American GIs, marines, and sailors stationed in Japan. Japanese people even to this day associate Americans with increased spending and economic liquidity.During the 80s, the love affair between Japan and America soured, but only a bit. As the US hit a recession and jobs began to dry up, a sudden backlash against “Made in Japan” goods - so coveted and desirable a decade prior - grew pretty loud. Some Americans felt like their money was being used to give the Japanese an unfair advantage. American military might gave Japan a huge spending advantage when it came to research and development - since Japan didn’t have to have a military budget, they allocated the new influx of funds towards engineering and technology. This was a brief and passing phase, however, and America as a whole never truly fell out of love with Japan.As early as 1948, the US Government had turned away from the racism and paranoia of WWII and had begun to reimburse those affected by the Japanese-American Internment Camps by restoring property and funds that were illegally seized. In the late 1980s, Ronald Regan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, legislation that paid reparations to those affected, to the tune of almost $1.6 billion. Japanese-Americans suddenly had money to invest in starting businesses, which also fostered stronger relations with their home country.While the reparations went a long way, it was the inflation of the yen which really cemented Japan and America’s economic ties. The yen’s inflation led to Japan opening a number of factories in the US and employing American workers. Major Japanese companies found it was cheaper to hire and manufacture in the States than pay the inflated import costs at that time. Communities of Japanese workers and executives cropped up - particularly in Southern California. So many Japanese businesses moved to Torrance, CA over the years that people joked it was “Japan’s 48th prefecture”. So again, economic forces drove Japan and the US to deepen their bond. Americans in the US found that Japanese folks were peace loving, industrious, and deeply invested in social harmony - which (believe it or not) in the 50s, most Americans were too. While Americans were more direct and individualistic than Japanese folks, each could appreciate the approach of the other in those days. Japanese people in Japan found that for the most part Americans who visited or came to live there were curious, friendly, and respectful of Japan’s way of life, though they did try to bring some of their “American-ness” with them.(“The Prince and the Pauper”: Bruce Kaji, founder of the Japanese American National Museum, welcomes the Crown Prince of Japan to Los Angeles, CA, 1951)Lastly, Japan and the US discovered a shared love of entertainment, culture, and technology over the years: Japan became a technological powerhouse just as the US was emerging from WWII as an economic powerhouse. Companies like Sony and Nintendo (among many others) benefited greatly from America’s post war economic boom - as Americans had time on their hands and money to spend, and Japan had the technological prowess to create luxury goods like the NES and the Walkman. A lot of middle-class “80s kids” think of Japan quite fondly - the NES was in almost every household, many kids had a Sony Walkman, and Japanese animation and video games were taking the country by storm all through the early to mid 80s.Japan provided the entertainment and leisure products that America could afford to enjoy, and the cross-pollination between the two countries continues to this day. While Japan and America have a complicated relationship, the goodwill between the two countries seems stronger than ever with no signs of diminishing.","91,387 followers",Roland Bartetzko,569,3.4K,313.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

When the Americans took Japanese islands, they would be surprised to see Japanese civilians throwing themselves from the cliffs to die. Why did they do this? Because they assumed that the Americans would brutalize and murder them. Because that was how the Japanese did things.So when the Americans decided to use the atomic bombs one at a time to minimize casualties as an expression of mercy and just show the Japanese what they could do, the Japanese did not pick up on it immediately.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,3.8K,5.6K,426.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-simply-add-more-stages-to-a-fusion-bomblet-to-reach-breakeven-in-ICF-fusion

Currently, government policies will not allow them to be built in the US.",3 followers,Michael Bross,636,1K,6.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apollo-fusion-doing

37,"I believe the most important advancement is the integrated circuit. The invention of complex circuitry on a piece of Silicon has made all of the technology possible. Before IC’s discrete components had to be connected, usually on a printed circuit board which made miniaturization impossible of the sort needed for computers and all other complex electronics.How many transistors does a modern CPU such as an Intel i3, i5, or an i7 have?As a rough estimate a modern computer processor has 3.2 billion transistors.","358,086 followers",Sean Kernan,10.1K,5.6K,723M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apollo-fusion-doing

You may want to do your own research for exact stats.But the point is that this gun was made along with 4 cannonballs, purely to be a symbol of power. Because you know, if they’d repurposed the cannon to make several, smaller, albeit less impressive, but infinitely more useful cannons, they could have won more battles and used their war record as a symbol of power.I’m not suggesting that this would have massively altered history. But the problem with this cannon is that it doesn’t even fulfil the bs purpose for which it was built. It’s not a symbol of power. It’s a symbol of ego.
