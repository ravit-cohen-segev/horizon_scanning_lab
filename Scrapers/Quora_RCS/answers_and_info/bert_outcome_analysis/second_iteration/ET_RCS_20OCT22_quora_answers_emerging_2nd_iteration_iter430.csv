It would not make it out of the containment building. In all likelihood it would not leave the reactor vessel itself.Here is a brief list of actual commercial power reactor core meltdowns (some may disagree on the list):• The 1966 Enrico Fermi meltdown killed no one. No one was displaced.• The 1967 Windscale meltdown killed no one. No one was displaced.• The 1977 KS 150 meltdown killed no one. No one was displaced.• The 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown killed no one. Several thousand people were temporarily displaced.• The 1980 Saint-Laurent meltdown killed no one. No one was displaced.• The 1986 Chernobyl meltdown killed dozens; eventually thousands may die. Many thousands of people were permanently displaced.• The 2011 Fukushima meltdown killed no one due to radiation. Thousands of people were temporarily displaced; many were displaced permanently.Note that Chernobyl really is no longer relevant because its main problem was poor design that no one would build today. Any reactors we would build in the future would be ten to a hundred times safer than the ones were are operating today.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nuclear-power-plants-meltdown

The fission fragments are radioactive, which is to say, at some unpredictable future time they will release a small additional burst of energy.To produce a typical nuclear power reactor’s three billion watts of heat, 10^20 heavy atoms must fission per second, and while any one of the two-times-10^20 fragments has an unpredictable future, collectively they are predictable.

Garland, gives the formula we know they’ll follow.So, for instance — reading from Appendix 2 — one second after a reactor that has been going at three billion watts has had its fission rate reduced to zero, delayed power will still be 0.0625 times 3 GW, still 188 megawatts. 4000 seconds, 0.0128 times 3 GW.Not all reactors can self-melt with this small but slow-to-diminish residual power, but large high-powered water-cooled ones can if the core is exposed due to a drop in the water level.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nuclear-power-plants-meltdown
2,"Why do nuclear power plants meltdown?A nuclear power plant core meltdown is a type of nuclear accident which occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the reactors cooling systems to the point where at least a few of the hundreds of solid fuel rods containing Uranium fuel has its fuel rod outer wrappers (called cladding) melt. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of reactor coolant or loss of coolant pressure. A meltdown can also be caused by a low coolant flow rate or be the result of a spike in the fission reaction rate which causes the reactor to overheatWhy do nuclear power plants meltdown?A nuclear power plant core meltdown is a type of nuclear accident which occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the reactors cooling systems to the point where at least a few of the hundreds of solid fuel rods containing Uranium fuel has its fuel rod outer wrappers (called cladding) melt. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of reactor coolant or loss of coolant pressure. A meltdown can also be caused by a low coolant flow rate or be the result of a spike in the fission reaction rate which causes the reactor to overheat. A spike in fission reaction rate, if not corrected, could result in a run away to ever higher temperatures resulting in a meltdown of fuel rods and damage to the fission reactor structure.Not all reactors are subject to core meltdowns. It is primarily only solid fuel water or sodium cooled reactors that are subject to this safety vulnerability. There are classes of nuclear reactors that can not melt down. One such class of meltdown free nuclear reactor is called a Molten Salt Reactor.Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are fluid fueled reactors where the Uranium fuel is dissolved in fluoride molten salts. With MSRs, there are no fuel rods or core formed of fuel assemblies that can melt - the Uranium fuel is dissolved directly in the salt, so this class of reactor cannot melt down.Fusion reactors are also considered meltdown proof as in a fusion reactor, there are no fuel rods, only high temperature fusion plasma confined by a strong magnetic field or by the natural inertia of fusion fuel.The most likely fusion reactions to first be explored release only a relatively small amount of the energy generated by fusion as heat. With Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fusion, 80% of the energy of the fusion reaction is released as energetic neutrons and only 20% of the energy of fusion is released as heat. In an accident, a fusion reactor does not tend to over-heat and melt. Most accidents should result in a immediate halt to production of fusion energy, so a fusion power plant just immediately stops working and producing heat when accidents arise.Some reasons why nuclear fusion power plants are likely to be even safer than fission power plants and less subject to meltdown.","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nuclear-power-plants-meltdown

Nobody can say how politics, science, and engineering will progress beyond 50 years. Who knows? We might even come to our senses with respect to radiation fear and begin to really become concerned about global climate change. I think that will take at least 50 years though.I think perhaps a fusion rocket application will be developed within 50 years where the advantages of using hydrogen reaction mass tilt advantage towards a pure fusion machine and where cost is less important than in terrestrial power applications where so many alternatives exist. Also, the space application has the advantage of being in an already high radiation environment and perhaps adequately far from population to quell fear.","220,155 followers",Franklin Veaux,550,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-main-fuel-for-fusion-reactors

The theory was presented his paper, “ The Internal Constitution of The Stars.” Around 1938, German nuclear physicist Hans Bethe formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis based on proton-proton fusion. This turned out to be the correct explanation for the mechanism by which stars generate energy. Prior to 1920, the source of stellar energy was total mystery. Over all the centuries before, no one knew the answer to the question, “Why do the stars shine?”The series of equations Bethe formulated explained the scientific basis for stellar energy production. The reactions he described involve thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium which releases an enormous amount of energy based on the Einstein formula E=MC2. For this work, Hans Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1967.As far back as 1938, the idea of building a generator based on fusion was being discussed and after World War II, research in fusion power accelerated. However, it was not long before scientists began to realize that artificial fusion was considerably more difficult than making a fission reactor. Nuclear fusion is possible in stars because the combination heat and immense gravity brings nuclei in close enough proximity that the electrostatic Coulomb Barrier, which keeps atoms apart, can be overcome. At that point, the strong nuclear force ( this being the fundamental force that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus), predominates and fusion can then take place via Quantum Tunnelling.Beginning in the 1950s, physicists and engineers began efforts to develop a terrestrial generator based on Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion,(CTNF) that would replicate what stars do naturally. It was well known that fusion of light nuclei like hydrogen was capable of producing an amount of energy 3 orders of magnitude greater than the opposite process of fission using very heavy elements such as uranium. Moreover, CTNF does not create high level radioactive waste and the essential fuel for a fusion device is Deuterium ( heavy hydrogen) which can be extracted from sea water. Our oceans contain an approximate 50 million year supply of this fuel.After several decades of research into CTNF, scientists became aware of the enormous complexity involved in the development of a terrestrial fusion machine. CTNF on Earth requires the use of much higher temperatures ( far greater than that found in the Sun), on the order of 150 million degrees Celsius.The past 50 years of fusion research has been focused on devising a mechanism to hold active plasma at this high temperature in an apparatus for long enough to generate usable energy.Given that it is impossible to create a gravitational field on Earth that would approximate that which is present in a star, a correlate had to be devised. The entity that corresponds to gravity in artificial fusion studies is intensely powerful fields generated by superconductor magnets. ITER will utilize a 13 Tesla magnetic field. The concept is that with such a “magnetic bottle” it will be possible to contain , in a stable configuration, fusion plasma which is also sustainable. This difficulty involving plasma stability is perhaps the principle engineering and physics challenge that has made development of fusion a very slow process. Thermonuclear fusion can be started within an experimental machine known as Tokamak which is a toroidal ( doughnut shaped) chamber. The Deuterium - Tritium fuel is heated to the very high temperature which allows thermonuclear fusion to begin. However, as I have noted, the resulting plasma has to be held at that temperature to maintain continuous fusion long enough to generate usable energy.Over the past 30 years or so, it has become clear that an apparatus using the tokamak configuration offers the greatest potential for development of CTNF as a future method for generating energy. This approach is known as the“ Magnetic Confinement” method.Several experimental tokamak devices have been in operation around the world for the past 20 years. These have demonstrated that CTNF can be achieved. Yet, the active plasma can only be contained for brief periods of time that measure in seconds. In present day research machines which do not allow for sustained control, the temperature within the tokamak drops and the active plasma looses coherence and flickers out of existence. It is just as if one had blown out a candle. Thus , the essential problem to be solved is to discover a mechanism that allows one to maintain control of the fusion plasma for an extended period. I would not regard it as an understatement to say that stable plasma confinement is the last remaining obstacle standing in the way practical CTNF.As you are reading this commentary, there is an international group constructing a complex apparatus designed to verify that CTNF is possible. This is the ITER Consortium which is comprised of the European Union, United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Russia and China.ITER is an acronym for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. ITER is also the Latin word meaning The Way. This scientific project is going to pave the way for a new method of generating energy. Construction of ITER began in 2010 in Cadarche France. As of 6 June \2020, the installation was 69.3% of the way to full completion. When the apparatus is completed, the first plasma experiments will commence. On the current schedule, the date for initial operation of ITER is December \ 2025. The total cost, to be shared amongst the consortium, will be ~ $20 Billion.At full power, ITER is designed to generate 500 MW of excess power. Once this milestone is reached, the world will be on a direct path to a new source of energy. The way will be open to constructing commercial fusion power stations all across our planet.I have studied the subject of CTNF for the last 30 years out of an innate and profound interest. Within the past few years, in the midst of writing a novel, I have followed closely the ongoing research efforts. Taken together, my natural optimism for the future and my intuitional sense informs me that generation of energy via controlled fusion will be realized. I believe this will happen in my own lifetime. The advent of plentiful fusion based energy will profoundly alter the entire course of Human Civilization. I predict that, in time, the New World which emerges will be magnificent, prosperous and filled with wonders and advances beyond anything we can presently imagine.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nuclear-power-plants-meltdown
