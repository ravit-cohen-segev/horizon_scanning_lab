5,"Time Magazine’s choice of Person of the Year has historically been someone who is a major influencer, regardless good or bad. In the past, they have selected Hitler, Stalin, and Putin, and few can argue that they all brought about significant change in their countries. Elon Musk seems a wise choice, as he gets much press (even encourages that?), has many followers on twitter, has excited the public about battery-cars (more for performance and status than “saving the planet”), re-using space vehicles, dreams of autonomous cars and private car tunnels, and electronic brain implants.In reality, mTime Magazine’s choice of Person of the Year has historically been someone who is a major influencer, regardless good or bad. In the past, they have selected Hitler, Stalin, and Putin, and few can argue that they all brought about significant change in their countries. Elon Musk seems a wise choice, as he gets much press (even encourages that?), has many followers on twitter, has excited the public about battery-cars (more for performance and status than “saving the planet”), re-using space vehicles, dreams of autonomous cars and private car tunnels, and electronic brain implants.In reality, many of these ideas haven’t panned out. Tesla no longer states that their in-work Full Self Driving software will allow autonomous driving and their suggested robo-taxis are years late and appear still far off. SpaceX is facing a near-term crisis as Elon just realized that their large Raptor engine has major problems, while their StarLink internet system profitability relies upon it and their in-work StarShip vehicle. Meanwhile, their low-orbit satellites are already beginning to fall back to Earth. The Las Vegas Boring Co tunnel has turned out nothing like the renderings of autonomous buses, relying instead upon drivers in normal Tesla cars shuttling passengers thru narrow tunnels. Elon’s earlier push for a vacuum-pod HyperLoop system seems to have fallen by the wayside. But, Elon regularly pivots to new ideas, none original and many even from cover drawings on 1960’s Popular Mechanics magazines, but after Elon promotes them his large fanbase proclaims it “genius”, which is why he is a major influencer.More nefarious has been his influencing investments like crypto. He pushed Doge-coin, which began as a joke but now has a valuation of $21B with perhaps no basis behind it. He has also dabbled in politics, where his opinions surprised his more liberal followers, such as his Trumpish terming CV-19 as “just a flu”, “gone by April”, and suggesting hydroxychloroquine as a cure. He has sparred with former Sec. of Labor Robert Reich on twitter over unions and worker rights. He even responded to a tweet by Sen. Bernie Sanders like a petulant child might with “keep forgetting you are still alive”. He tweeted a nasty sexual comment to Sen Ron Wyden in response to taxing billionaires, plus an allusion to Jack In the Box restaurant workers masturbating on their burgers. This seems to only embolden his millennial followers who grew up typing rude comments in online video games. Musk is attuned to our new web-world where considered thought and decency has been replaced by mob rule, so don’t fault Time’s choice.","19,199 followers",Jim Cantrell,4.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-solar-power-for-cryptocurrency-mining

Following the growth of Tesla shares, the value of the assets of this American entrepreneur exceeded $ 185 billion. Ilan Company put a computer chip mask in the pig's brain Tesla's Founder Dream: A network of underground streets in Los Angeles The Titan Project and the story of Ilan Mask's offer to Apple Ilan Mask unveiled the first high-speed underground tunnel Successful test of 'Spacecraft' by SpaceX But what is the secret of his success? I talked about this with Ilan Musk for about an hour a few years ago, and now that he has just had some success, I decided to wrap up my interview and share it with you. So here are you and Ilan Mask's tips for business success: 1- It is not a question of money This is a key point in Ilan Mask's approach to business. When I interviewed him in 2014, he said he did not know how rich he was: ""It's not like there's a lot of cash out there. ""Those votes are valuable."" Mr Musk does not oppose hoarding ""in a just and moral way"" but says the main motivation is not money. An approach that seems to have worked. Tesla Model X90's display at a trade show in Brussels Image source, GETTY IMAGES Image description, Tesla Model X90's display at a trade show in Brussels Mr. Musk's fortunes, inspired by Tony Stark, the main character in the Iron Man movie series starring Robert Downey Jr., reached perhaps $ 10 billion in 2014 at the time of this interview. His electric car maker, Tesla, has done particularly well. The company's stock has grown significantly in recent years, reaching a current value of more than $ 700 billion. With that money, you can buy Ford, General Motors, Biamo, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler, and still have enough money to buy a Ferrari. But Mr. Musk, who turns 50 this year, does not expect the rich to die. He said he thought he would spend most of his money building a base on Mars, and he would not be surprised if all his wealth was spent on the project. Like Bill Gates, he probably sees the billions of dollars in his bank account at the time of his death as a sign of failure because it means he has not used his wealth well. 2.

Programs End of podcast Building a base on Mars is the key to understanding what Ilan Mask sees as key to success. ""You want everything to get better in the future,"" he told me. ""You want these exciting new things to make life better."" Take SpaceX, for example. He told me he started the company because he expected the US space program to be more ambitious. ""I was expecting to go beyond Earth, take humans to Mars and build a base on the moon,"" he said. When that did not happen, the idea for the Mars Oasis mission came to him; The project aimed to send a miniature greenhouse to the Red Planet. By doing so, Ilan Musk wanted to get people interested in space again, forcing the US government to increase NASA's budget. But as he worked to launch the project, he realized that ""there is no lack of will"" and that space technology was costing more than it should. And so the world's least expensive missile launch company came into being. The SpaceX rocket is being prepared for a test launch at the company's facility in Boka Chika, Texas. Image source, REUTERS Image description, The SpaceX rocket is being prepared for a test launch at the company's facility in Boka Chika, Texas. But the important thing is that his goal was not to make money, but to take humans to Mars. Musk told me that he considered himself more of an engineer than an investor, and that his interest in finding solutions to tactical problems motivated him to wake up every morning. And that's his criterion for measuring progress, not filling his bank account. He knows full well that every obstacle he leaves behind in his business will help all those who are looking for a solution to a similar problem, and the effect will be lasting. That's why a few years ago, shortly before this interview, he announced that he was universalizing Tesla's patent patents to speed up the process of building electric vehicles around the world. 3- Do not be afraid of having big thoughts One of the highlights of Ilan Mask is his boldness and recklessness in business.
