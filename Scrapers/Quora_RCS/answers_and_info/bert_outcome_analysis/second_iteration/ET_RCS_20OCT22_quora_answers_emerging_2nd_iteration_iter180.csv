There are way more moving parts, and everything has to continue operating for extended periods. Development of the first grid-linked nuclear fission power plants took 10 years after the development of nuclear fission weapons.Development of fusion weapons (hydrogen bombs) also took almost 10 years of limitless government funding after the development of fission weapons. So you're combining two different challenges: fusion is harder to master than fission, and power production is harder to master than weapon production. The complexity increases exponentially.All in all, we should expect that a controlled fusion energy source will take a long time to develop.We're working our way throughYou really can't rush this stuff much.

To build superconducting coils at this scale requires cutting edge technology and very expensife. For example, the superconducting material needs to be cooled to a temperature of -269 degC (4 K). Nothing better exists at this moment. But if we would be able to use a material that could produce a larger field and/or at higher temperature, commercial fusion could all of a sudden be very close!However, such a material has not been found yet, and to develop this from the lab to a full scale fusion experiment will take at least 10 years.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-take-to-make-radical-breakthroughs-quickly-in-fusion-energy-technology

Within a few years we will have fusion power stations and energy will be almost free.”The nuclear bombs were very dirty fission-fusion cross bastards and the Fusion power is still not here nearly 70 years later.The tech problems are just as insurmountable and the cost of building them if they work will beggar the richest nations.Home grown nuclear fusion power will not be anywhere near free or within the next 30 or so years.Much better to get the near free nuclear fusion power from the sun, available now in larger amounts than we can possibly use.All we have to do is finish the work of building the incredibly cheap thermal batteries and interface them to existing thermal power stations.The technology is scaleable from 100 Watts Hours to 10′s of Gigawatt Hours and beyond.As this is all thermally based, not photo voltaic or PV for short, it uses nearly 100% of the suns energy when the energy is used thermally from the thermal battery to produce heating or cooling, such as around the home or factory. Heating and cooling are both thermal processes.Nuclear, Electricity, coal,oil or gas are just energy transfer methods, Batteries if you like, not needed if the sun delivers it straight to your door.My initial estimates is that thermal processes like heating, cooking, refrigeration, air-conditioning, etc account for about 80% of energy requirements. Thermal fridges and freezers will require conversion from gas, kero or other thermal sources to hot oil or hot water.If you need to generate electricity, say for lighting, computers, battery charging or laundry then the heat can be converted, to electricity, by at least three different means.By Stirling Engine at 30 to 50% efficiency.By Steam engine or Turbine at 35 to 20% efficiency.By Seebeck Device at about 8%.Alternately you can install a small solar PV system with small lithium ion battery at between 25 and 6% efficiency depending on the type of solar cells you buy. Unlike CST which uses almost 100% of the available spectrum of energy put out by the sun, PV solar cells use only about a third of the available spectrum and then the very best give a 25% max. output efficiency.Poor quality spray on silicon can be as low as 6%, I know, I have one, it puts out 100 watts max and takes more 50% more space than a better quality 250 watt one.A 250 watt cell that takes up 1 square metre is 25% efficient.Some of the old cadmium telluride ones were even less efficient and old cells fall away as they age.The above map shows where Solar technologies work best, the red,orange and yellow areas.The American inventor, Frank Shuman, proved all this at Maadi, Egypt in 1912-1913. Shuman’s plant used parabolic troughs to power a 60-70 horsepower engine that pumped 6,000 gallons of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields.After running his plant for 4 years he was able to release the following statement,“We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun.”— Frank Shuman, New York Times, July 2, 1916.Because all this is based on technology available in 1910 or earlier it is ideally suited to low tech countries with limited fabrication capabilities, such as Australia.Practical examples of electricity generating plants, of Concentrated Solar Thermal with and without the more expensive Molten Salt Thermal Storage option, exist from :The SEGS installation at Daggett, in Southern California, which is a 9 farm 350MW facility installed and running from 1984 to the present. This has no storage but uses heated oil as the transfer medium to run steam generators. It must be reaching the end of its life but could be converted to hot oil or solid block storage. Because of the more aged infrastructure this type of system may need to use a more expensive copper or aluminium storage battery.Through the generating and thermal storage plants at Andasol, at Andalusia, in Spain, is a 3 farm 150MW faciloity with 7.5 hours of Molten salt storage at each farm, it began operation over the period 2007 to 2011.TL:DRAnd the cheapest way to gain almost unlimited amounts of fusion energy?Up to 50,000 times more than our current total energy usage?From the sun! Every sunny day! Its supplied free and if stored thermally, costs about 2 to 3 cents per KWH in store, storage cost amortised over 10 years.No expensive lithium batteries, just pure heat at 500 degrees, ready to go into existing Coal, Gas or Nuclear power stations.This works best between the 40th parallels of latitude, it just gets a little harder as you go towards the poles. :)Suited to low tech countries with limited fabrication capabilities./TL:DRA good deal of the above information was supplied by Wikipedia to whom I am eternally grateful.If you find the above Info interesting or useful, pass it on to others. and upvote or share it.Version o.8ßc 20190608 09:40AM Australian Central Standard TimeThis is a work in progress, it represents 10 years of partime work and research.I submit it for publication because there seems no other way of storage.","220,146 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-difficult-to-get-energy-from-nuclear-fusion

Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which produces a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount ofThe problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Heavy Lift Pure Fusion Rockets for MarsA thermonuclear pure fusion rocket can follow the same approach as was suggested for Orion-type nuclear fission explosive rockets through a series of controlled limited yield peaceful fusion explosive bursts. Being pure fusion devices without any nuclear fission component, such Peaceful Fusion Nuclear Explosives (PFNE) powered rockets would produce no radioactive fallout in the earth’s atmosphere. PFNE powered rockets producing a hydrogen plasma jet velocity of 30 km/s could make it possible to reach the orbital speed of 8 km/s using just one fusion rocket stage, instead of several hundred multi-stage chemical rockets, while assembling a large Mars rocket in low earth orbit. At an exhaust velocity of 30 km/s using 1 ton of Deuterium (hydrogen isotope) fusion fuel per second would produce 3000 tons of thrust.(picture of aA pure fusion nuclear rocket powered by the D-D fusion reaction could be designed to use only non-radioactive fusion fuel (Deuterium) and produce only non-radioactive nuclear waste (Helium-4) and some neutrons. If a pure fusion rocket were to blow up on the launch pad it would release principally only non-radioactive Deuterium and non-radioactive Helium-4.ConclusionThe feasibility of the proposed pure fusion propulsion concept would be of great significance for the future of space flight. It does not require a large number of chemical rockets to bring the parts of a Mars craft, for example, into low-earth orbit. Using only chemical rockets would not require multiple multistage chemical rocket launches and a Mars rocket assembly crew working in the weightless vacuum of space. Pure fusion rockets allow environmentally conscientious heavy life launches to space and direct to Mars without requiring difficult assembly of a large Mars rocket in orbit.Launching of large chemical rockets into space is still a fairly risky business.(more info)","29,751 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-take-to-make-radical-breakthroughs-quickly-in-fusion-energy-technology

You can’t achieve anything like the plasma densities that exist in the core of the Sun, which is also much cooler than the typical temperatures employed in the plasma in fusion reactor designs on Earth.You can’t do it, that is, except by employing absolutely extraordinary methods, such as in thermonuclear weapons, where the explosion of a small fission weapon is usedTo make fusion on Earth, as opposed to how it happens in the Sun, where gravity does most of the necessary work, you need to have very high temperatures to get sufficiently high reaction rates for a fusion reactor to be practical. You can’t achieve anything like the plasma densities that exist in the core of the Sun, which is also much cooler than the typical temperatures employed in the plasma in fusion reactor designs on Earth.You can’t do it, that is, except by employing absolutely extraordinary methods, such as in thermonuclear weapons, where the explosion of a small fission weapon is used to cause an implosion and very strong compression and heating and ignition of a mass of fusion fuel, which then burns very rapidly. This method, though it works, is obviously not ideal for power generation. You want something much more controlled, and more steady to produce power stably and efficiently.But the necessary high temperatures make that control extremely hard to accomplish, because high temperature plasma is very strongly driven to expand, and if it does expand then the fusion reactions turn off.The underlying physical reason that high temperature and density are required is that nuclei repel each other due to their positive charge, and they must be forced close enough together in order for the strong force to act, so that fusion reactions can occur. A way around this called muon catalysed fusion has been proposed, but it has not been made practical as yet.So far, the continuous fusion reactors, based on magnetic confinement of the plasma, haven’t been able to overcome plasma instabilities. While fusion can be created it has proven to be very hard to contain the plasma for long enough to be even close to making a practical reactor.It is similarly the case with pulsed fusion reactors based on inertial confinement, driven either by lasers or by heavy ion beams. They haven’t, yet, demonstrated a sufficiently positive energy return for a practical fusion power plant, even though it is definitely possible to create some fusion reactions by these methods.It’s simply a technically very hard problem.The only successful approach to producing large amounts of energy from fusion so far has been the explosion of thermonuclear bombs, and there are fairly obvious reasons why people don’t want to explode lots of thermonuclear weapons in order to try to generate electric power, though this has actually been proposed in a fairly serious way, using fission weapons. It was proposed to explode small fission bombs deep underground in large cavities, and to use the energy released to heat water into steam, or possibly even to use some other working fluid.The program was called PACER and it came out of research at LLNL. The idea was probably kicked around already at Los Alamos. For small fission weapons it was fairly easy to show that it couldn’t be done economically - it was much cheaper and obviously much safer at 1970’s uranium prices just to burn uranium in standard thermal nuclear power reactors.If you wanted to use fusion bombs there is the comprehensive test ban treaty in place, which would forbid even trying such ideas experimentally - you would have to get around that for a start. And so far fusion bombs are very big in yield, and all of them require a fission primary, which is a major complication due to the radioactivity of the fission products.",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777K,https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-take-to-make-radical-breakthroughs-quickly-in-fusion-energy-technology
