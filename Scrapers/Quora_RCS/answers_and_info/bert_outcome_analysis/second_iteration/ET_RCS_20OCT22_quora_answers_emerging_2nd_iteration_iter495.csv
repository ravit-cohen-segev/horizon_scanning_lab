Look at what chips are doing now.A lot of the stuff you find in hospitals now, was developed tens of years ago by nuclear and particle physicists to do experiments that were, at the time, impossible until those devices were invented.The World Wide Web, which you are using right now to view this answer, was developed by particle physicists who wanted to be able to share their research results, graphically, over the internet. Which was at that time, although technically possible, practically impossible due to the mismatches in computing systems being used at the various research labs and computer centers worldwide.The other answers given about why, from the scientific viewpoint, one should care about going to space, are very good and very relevant. Don't forget the almost inevitable spinoffs of unexpected uses of new technology, nor the fact that lots of scientific research is done by students, who go on to do great things, sometimes in completely unrelated fields of science and technology, or even in the business world.

It is a 3D render of the car that doesn’t change from vehicle to vehicle. My wife’s car is actually a super dark grey (almost black) color, not the medium grey displayed on the screen. I haven’t looked, but I’d bet that if your car was red, it would still display as grey on the image (though it would be cool if they changed the color of the image to match what is on your car).ADD: I found a great YouTube demonstration of this system, if you read all of this and though ‘What the heck are they going on about?’",393 followers,Aaron Granger,644,1.8K,3.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-speed-up-my-computer

Which is, in a way, understandable. But for those of you who want to know why it’s disturbing, I’ll try my best to explain as I LOVE this game and have been permanently scarred.SPOILERS AHEAD (And graphic content)The game is divided into 4 acts. Act 1 is pretty innocent and expected, it’s an anime-style dating simulator visual novel where you are welcomed into the literature club at your highschool by 4 beautiful anime girls- Sayori, Yuri, Monika and Natsuki.Sayori is your childhood friend and very upbeat and positive. She always puts a smile on people’s faces.Yuri is a more quiet, timid girl who loves reading and writing. Her poems are usually very symbolic and she tends to like darker themes.Monika is… just Monika. She’s the club president and seems nice enough but strangely, doesn’t get her own route.Natsuki is a small tsundere type girl who likes baking and cute things, though she’ll never admit it.Love these girls? Good! Now watch them all die horrible painful deaths.Sayori’s death is first. You learn one night that she has horrible depression and has had it her entire life. She only wants others to smile. You can confess your love to her if you so choose. The next morning, you decide to let her sleep and walk to school without her. After seeing Sayori’s newest poem, you realize you should probably go check on her.(Sayori’s latest poem, “Get Out of my Head”.You walk into her house to see her dead, hanging from the ceiling. Her lifeless body dangles and you, the main character, begin to panic seeing that your childhood friend has just killed herself.Since it’s a visual novel you can reset, right?Sayori is now out of the game and you enter act 2.I won’t go into… TOO much detail since I’m not sure what would be crossing the line on Quora here but basically it gets more and more twisted as you go along.Monika screws with Natsuki and Yuri’s files. They get more and more screwed up. 1/3 gameplays get the animation of Natsuki snapping her neck and running towards you with glitched eyes. Yuri becomes more and more obsessive, eventually confessing to you and stabbing herself repeatedly immediately afterwards.Then you can spend the weekend with a dead body.Fun.Eventually it’sMonika knows she’s in a game and wants only you.You end up having to delete Monika’s ‘file’ to end it all. Then you can replay the game with everyone BUT her. If you did everything correctly, Sayori will become self-aware and thank you for trying to make everyone happy.If not, she’ll become self-aware, go insane and try to take you for herself.The deeper you look into this game the worse it gets. It encourages the manipulation of files and leaves you petrified for days.Delete Monika before starting the game?Sayori becomes self-aware, goes insane, screams to “make it stop”, and hangs herself immediately.Delete Sayori before starting the game?No cutscene. Just hanging.The music also messes with you. Instruments get distorted or stop completely. When the music stops, you better prepare yourself cause something screwed up is going to happen.On the bright side, it ends with the credits playing an actually amazing song sung by Monika herself.So because of the music, story and incredibly graphic deaths, Doki Doki Literature Club is an insanely disturbing video game.*Big thanks to whoever suggested the edit (I forget the name, sorry!)",152 followers,Alex Mann,2K,2K,102.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-books-or-video-games-have-the-most-politically-complex-interesting-worlds

Luke Owen, 2017)The executives of the Japan-based Nintendo badly needed to win this case, as it could cripple the burgeoning video game company.They hired a big shot NYC attorney, John Kirby, who began litigating against Universal Studios.Interestingly, at one point in the trial, they brought in an actual TV with the video game to demonstrate the difference between Donkey Kong and King Kong:And lawyers began pitching their cases, interestingly around a video game.“Is it not obvious that people could easily be confused by the similarities between King Kong and Donkey Kong?”Back and forth in front of a jury, they picked apart the movie and the video game, comparing the two.Universal mounted a compelling case citing the similarities between the two games.But what Nintendo’s lawyer discovered, through immense research, ultimately undid Universal:Years prior, Universal Studio had been in a lawsuit where they had literally argued that King Kong was in the public domain and could be re-used by anyone.An argument that the then-presiding Judge ultimately ruled in agreement with.This fact, presented, infuriated the current judge, who saw Universal as having been a bully, who knew better than to have brought this lawsuit forward.

I’ve spent a week building an interplanetary ship to go to Duna (Mars) and land a rover, only to find out that the rover was uncontrollable on the surface.Here is a picture from a mod that helps you to plan your orbital transfer to other planets (you can’t just go to Mars any day of the year), but of course some players do these calculations by hand:Basic rocket equations, such as Tsiolkovsky’s rocket equation to calculate the dV (velocity increase) necessary for certain space missions/maneuvers, all apply.Of course, the brilliance of KSP is that it doesn’t have to be this difficult. Without any mods any player can land on the Mun (Moon) after about 50–100 hours of trial-and-error and playing around, doing simpler missions first (just reaching the atmosphere or achieving orbit around Kerbin [Earth]). You don’t need formulas or any knowledge of rocket science to achieve this.But if you challenge yourself to do more difficult missions and add more layers of complexity by downloading mods (like the mod that upscales the solar system to a real 1:1 scale), then you are in for a ride. People have built enormous space stations, carried asteroids back to Kerbin (Earth), escaped the solar system and built planetary bases on any of the planets.

An example follows belowI was playing as Venice (purple) in a multiplayer match of Civilization 5 with 7 other strangers. It was late in the game, and I was doing well. Through diplomatic means, I had acquired the tip of the peninsula in the right of the image above. China (green) was my strongest neighbor, and recent disagreements in the UN had made us distrustful of one another.The strait between my new peninsula and China was important to me. It was rich in oil and was a vital trade conduit; I needed it to be secure, so I casually, unthinkingly stationed a battleship and some destroyers near the mouth of the strait and forgot about them.Turns later, I noticed China had stationed a lot of infantry onto his side of the strait. I took this to be a petty show of force, and so to communicate that I wouldn’t be intimidated, stationed my marines on my side of the strait. His response was to move artillery up to the coast. I moved bombers to the peninsula. He brought up anti-aircraft guns. I stationed paratroopers on the peninsula. He brought in war ships. I brought in many more war ships. I was incensed. This couldn’t just be a show of force. He must want the oil; he had to be preparing for a full-scale invasion of the peninsula, and now the map looked like this:We’re staring down the barrel of each other’s guns, waiting for the other to make a move. We start trying to pass resolutions against one another in the UN. We start bribing neighbors for allegiance. We haven’t said a word to each other since we embarked upon this death-spiral more than 20 turns ago, but we both know any moment the other person is going to strike. The only way out is through. Then I see the last thing I wanted to see.Maybe ten tiles south of Venice is a lone Chinese carrier. Since my focus was on the strait, I’m only momentarily surprised that it snuck past my navy. The problem is the ship’s cargo. It’s carrying a single nuclear bomb and a bomber capable of dropping it. In one turn, it could be in range of Venice.Instantaneously, I have that carrier surrounded by battleships, destroyers and bombers. I have submarines scour the waters behind it, looking for other Chinese ships; I find none. I face a dilemma. Do I sink the carrier and guarantee a war or do I play it cool and try to negotiate him out of destroying my capital?If I declare war, I can easily sink the carrier before its nuclear cargo departs. I will have saved Venice, at least for the minute. However, then I’ll be in aIf I try to deescalate the situation with diplomacy, I may succeed, and that’ll be great. However, if I don’t take this opportunity to sink the carrier and fail to negotiate a truce, I may be in an already-lost war on China’s terms.The turn timer was ticking. I had to make this decision in under a minute, with limited information while panicking. What would you do?I decide to open the first dialogue in a very long time. The exchange went something like this:Me:HimMe:Him:Me:Him:Could it be that neither of us ever wanted a war that nearly happened? I suddenly felt rather silly. I neglected to ever notice that, just as I was frightened by the appearance of his nuclear bomb near my capital, he was frightened by the sudden appearance of my territory and navy near his. I mistook his insecurities for belligerence, and he mine. We negotiated a gradual deescalation and I went on to win the game diplomatically.Reminiscent of the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the absence of dialogue, years of misunderstanding, a spiral of escalating brinkmanship, and a moment’s panic nearly all collided into a conflagration that would have ended us both … and then those damned Aztecs would have won the game.This experience (among others throughout life) helped me realize that, though the world is full of crazy and evil people, they aren’t necessary for horrible things to happen. Sometimes, all it takes is peaceful, rational actors who are following the logic of their own limited perspectives to tragic ends.",374 followers,David Metcalfe,606,399,1.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-books-or-video-games-have-the-most-politically-complex-interesting-worlds
