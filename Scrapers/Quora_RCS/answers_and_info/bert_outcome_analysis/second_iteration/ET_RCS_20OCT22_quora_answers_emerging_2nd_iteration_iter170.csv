1,"Lets look at this pragmatically.A fusion reactor would fuse a deuterium atom with a tritium atom into a helium-4 nuclei and a free neutron. Lets look at the mass of the reactants and products.Deuterium:Tritium:Helium-4:Neutron:Lets sum the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products.ΣΣThe difference in those values isSo what happenLets look at this pragmatically.A fusion reactor would fuse a deuterium atom with a tritium atom into a helium-4 nuclei and a free neutron. Lets look at the mass of the reactants and products.Deuterium:Tritium:Helium-4:Neutron:Lets sum the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products.ΣΣThe difference in those values isSo what happened to that mass? We all know that conservation of mass is a thing, so what gives? Well mass has still been conserved, but we must look at things through the eyes of relativity. UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

2,"Lets get one thing straight - nuclear reactors don’t explode - at least not a nuclear explosion. It takes a lot of finagling to get stuff together fast enough to get a big bang, and you just can’t do that with reactors. Even Chernobyl had nothing like a nuclear explosion. Steam, hydrogen only.,There is a problem with comparing fission and fusion reactors: there really aren’t any fusion reactors. They are trying mightily to get one going by itself without massive power from the outside to keep it going.

They are trying mightily to get one going by itself without massive power from the outside to keep it going. No luck so far.However, there is this: Fission reactors have a LOT of fuel (Uranium, usually) in them. Tons of it! And lots of radioactive decay products of nuclear fission. If something goes disastrously wrong (Chernobyl) there’s an awful lot of radioactive material to spread around.Fusion reactors will presumably have very little fuel at one time, as it gets fed in and burned up continually. Grams, maybe. Pounds - no way! And the “fuel” is relatively harmless. Deuterium, Lithium, stuff like that. The Fusion reactor itself, on the other hand will be quite radioactive: The many tons of whatever its built from will have been intensely irradiated by the fusion going on, producing radioactive material, but I doubt that it can match the wide variety of nasty stuff from a fission reactor. So: I think a fission reactor would have far more potential for radioactive contamination than a fusion reactor, once we have one. But explosive danger? No.[ Thought added in edit: I do see one problem peculiar to the type of fusion reactors we’re working on now: the huge magnetic field they require. These magnetic field are critical to the fusion reactor operation, and the stronger the field, the smaller the reactor can be. These fields store a LOT of energy, and depend upon superconductors to keep the huge currents flowing. If part of the electric circuit drops out of superconductivity, the energy gets dumped into that failed part, and will create a huge electric arc, likely destroying the field coils, possibly destroying the whole system. Something similar happened in the early days of the supercollider in Switzerland/France. No hydrogen explosion, probably nothing to scatter things far and wide, so little danger to surrounding community, and they have ways to prevent this happening, they think.

Why have I then heard…”…that it is so difficult making a fusion reactor while fission reactors are mundane?For the same reason a hand-cranked dynamo cannot power your household: you do not get enough energy out of it. The fusor does fusion, no doubt about it, but the number of reactions are much too few to be of any practical use.“Okay, so why are fusion reactors so hard to make?”Because that in order to make a self-sustaining fusion chain reaction on a large scale, you need extreme pressure and/or temperature (*), while fission reactions on a large scale can take place at Normal Temperature and Pressure.Essentially the hard part is this: how do you hold contained a fuel that is so hot that it makes everything it touches not just melt but turn into plasma, no matter what material you use?
