Alternately we can explode miniature (micro-sized) hydrogen bombs as is done in inertial fusion. So making fusion is rather easy. The hard challenge for fusion reactors are two-fold:1. Exceed break even point on Energy: In other words make more energy than the energy you use to start the reaction. Power reactors are meant to make energy not use them. So you need to exceed that point and that has been the difficult task with all magnetic confinement fusion schemes. The Tokamak research, for instance, started very promising but it proved very challenging to get the density and temperature combination that exceeds the breakeven point. The magnetic confinement method is just getting to that point this decade. The inertial fusion which uses lasers to implode a small pellet of DT exceeded breakeven point long ago but has a different challenge (see 2 below).",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The energy density in the core of the sun is only about that of a good compost heap:So this is the challenge - reproduce the conditions of an H-bomb but do it continuously. In an H bomb we generate the conditions by setting off a fission bomb.In a reactor, we want to contain the energy generated by fusion such that the hydrogen stays hot enough to fuse. It is not enough to have fusion, the fusion itself must create the heat needed to keep the hydrogen hot enough to fuse - the reaction must be self sustaining. This is different than a H-bomb where happens so incredibly quickly that by the time that the hydrogen escapes, enough of it has already reacted.The leading candidates for confinement are inertial confinement and magnetic confinement.Inertial confinement is basically the H-bomb system but with the heating and compression of the fission bomb being replaced by lasers. We make pellets of deuterium and tritium. We feed them to a reaction chamber. We put very precise optics around the chamber somehow such that intense laser light compresses and ignites the pellet causing a miniature H bomb explosion. Most of the energy comes out in the form of 14.7 MeV neutrons which trash the apparatus over time but also are used to breed more tritium. Ultimately there are two big thresholds which are overall system energy breakeven - you have to generate enough heat to convert to electricity (something like 2/3rd’s of which is lost due to thermodynamic laws) to power the lasers.The second big threshold is that you have to make this into a power plant. Power plant concepts that we use now are very simple - boil water in a pot - and end up still producing a significant bill at the end of the month! Laser based inertial confinement seems extremely complicated and inherently expensive by comparison. Ultimately it is always about money (unless it is about physics). It is one thing to spend money on research and another to have to build and maintain plants each of which is ten times (or a hundred times???) more expensive than what we have now producing power.Magnetic confinement is more about physics, perhaps. Well, the current experimental tokamak facility being built, ITER, looks like it may reach 20 billion before completion, so maybe it is more about money! Note that this is not 20 billion for a power plant, this is just the proof of principle experiment - the proof that the physics can be licked. The argument is that if we make the experiment big enough, that that will be enough to fix the physics (plus it will take a lot of researchers through to their retirement age as we have been working on magnetic confinement for 50 years now).At any rate, the physics issues are perhaps radiation loss and instabilities. Confining the plasma, the very hot, ionized, hydrogen gas has been likened to confining jello with rubber bands - it always wants to squeeze out, it always wants to find a hole, or to make a hole.Radiation losses are that the magnetic confinement works because charged particles circle magnetic field lines. Circling particles are accelerating. Accelerating charges radiate energy. This energy is lost from the plasma cooling it (and the plasma is tenuous enough that making the reactor bigger doesn’t help this problem). The plasma is really hot, perhaps 800 million degrees centigrade such that the particles are moving really fast, such that they accelerate a lot, such that they radiate a lot. For DT fusion, most of the energy is in the neutron that is created which is all lost from the plasma. For other types of fusion, less (or no) energy is in produced neutrons, but these must be much hotter such that the radiation losses are greater. Beyond the first few easiest fusion reactions, the radiation losses are obviously prohibitive.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant
2,"No, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain.

Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissociated jumble of ions, it does not turn all of it to plasma. That is problem number one. The second problem is that a plasma now is filled with charged particles that have, you guessed it, their own little magnetic fields. This means that they mess with the other ions in unpredictable and unwanted ways. This lack of uniformity means that you need to have bigger and more expensive magnets to push them back in line and behave.

3,"We are realistically closer to a viable nuclear fusion power plant today.Mankind currently possesses an existing terrestrial fusion technology experimentally proven to “work” and produce fusion with energy gain -It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~30 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusionWe are realistically closer to a viable nuclear fusion power plant today.Mankind currently possesses an existing terrestrial fusion technology experimentally proven to “work” and produce fusion with energy gain -It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~30 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusionThe problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium).Pure Inertial Confinement Fusion that does not use nuclear fission to produce the conditions for fusion is today fusion driver limited.It is still not experimentally possible to build a laser (or ion particle accelerator) large enough to produce DT fusion ignition. Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of cold war underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule.These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1977 - 1987) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked and reliably and repeatedly produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.What is lacking in current ICF fusion experiments to support building of practical ICF fusion power plants is a fusion driver with characteristics close enough to the driver employed by LANL and LLNL in Halite-Centurion tests to permit full fusion ignition with energy gain. A driver capable of delivering greater than 20 MJ into a focused area less than a 2 mm in time of less than 3 nanoseconds. The current NIF driver laser driver is capable of delivering about 2 MJ total energy and is only able to achieve ""alpha heating"" phase of fusion operation - a stage that immediately precedes fusion ignition. LASNEX and HYDRA computer simulations of the mid-1990s on which LLNL based the engineering design of the NIF laser were overly optimistic in predicting the required fusion driver characteristics to produce ignition. Failure of the LASNEX and HYDRA simulations resulted in NIF being built too small to achieve the goal of fusion ignition and for NIF to serve as the basis of LIFE ICF fusion power plant technology. It must also however be admitted that besides driver power, there are other slightly less critical (but still important) unsolved engineering issues for ICF including implosion symmetry and plasma instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor) that rob energy from ICF plasma when it nears fusion conditions. Use of a more robust fusion driver such as was employed in cold war Halite-Centurion X-ray initiated DT fusion experiments permitted slightly less than optimum symmetry and mild plasma instabilities and still work and produce DT fusion with energy gain.The Sustained Four Decade Progress in High Power Pulsed Lasers has been phenomenal and continues to be phenomenal.Progress in the laser fusion driver area holding back ICF fusion is proceeding rapidly and relentlessly, with a four decade demonstrated rate of advance that exceeds any other sustained technology effort (including Moore’s law - the growth in the number of transistors on CPU chips). In the past ten years, the power of large fast pulse lasers of type appropriate as a laser fusion driver has improved by a factor of 1000X.Fast Pulse lasers are rapidly getting improving relative to other possible ICF fusion drivers. While lasers are getting more powerful - they are also getting cheaper to build and operate.The following link is to a table showing the historical progress of fast pulse lasers as are appropriate for use as ICF fusion drivers -High Power Pulsed LasersIt must however be admitted that in an environment of considerable progress, existing laser drivers are still too small to reliably produce ICF DT fusion ignition. Successful ignition requires high delivered power combined with sufficient total energy delivered to the fusion capsule.Based on results of actual cold war Halite-Centurion ignition experimentsfull DT ignition of small sub-gram DT spheres requires -20 MJ of x-ray laser energy delivered to a spot 2 mm in diameter in a time frame of ~3 nanoseconds or less.NIF is currently only capable of producing about 2 MJ of energy but is capable of producing 500 TW short bright powerful light pulses on the order of about 100 femtoseconds in width to the fusion target. Losses inside the hohlraum reduce delivered X-ray energy to the actual fusion capsule to around 26 kilojoules of energy.NIF is currently not capable of producing full fusion ignition but succeeds in operating in a ""alpha-heating"" regime that occurs just prior to ignition.Good work in the direction of pure ICF fusion devices already exists -In the cold war era, LANL and LLNL did preliminary pure fusion device designs but were not successful with available 1970s fusion driver technology. In the year 2001 DOE permitted disclosure of the fact that the US had a well organized and well funded sustained effort to produce ultra-clean pure fusion devices that did not require nuclear fission to produce the conditions for ICF fuson.RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html(see section C of this document)Good Preliminary designs for ICF fusion power plants now exist -Dr. Ralph Moir has designed several Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants. His ideas deserve much greater study and commercial development once pure ICF laser fusion energy with gain is demonstrated.

Fusion power is the ultimate lottery: but we do not know if the winning numbers actually exist.As for what it will mean for mankind, your guess is a bad as mine. We simply do not know if it will ever be economically feasible to power our energy needs with fusion. Indeed, it may come to pass that fusion, because of its costs, becomes merely a niche power source. Or it may usher in the dawn of a second energy revolution with ramifications as great as the first (the harnessing of fossil fuels in the 19th and 20th centuries).

Lithium is embedded in a blanket surrounding the tokamak vacuum chamber where fusion occurs. Each neutron - lithium reaction produces one nucleus of tritium, which is to be carried away and reutilized as fuel. Let us put aside all technological issues involved. The problem is that one deuterium - tritium reaction produces one neutron, and one neutron - lithium reaction produces one nucleus of tritium, which in turn will allow one new deuterium - tritium reaction. This, if only one neutron is lost during the whole process (e.g. if it gets absorbed by the tokamak walls, the surrounding environment etc.) then tritium is found to be missing, sooner or later. Since neutron losses are unavoidable, this means that continuous operation of deuterium - tritium tokamak reactors ultimately relies on some external source of tritium in order to compensate for losses, e.g. on an external nuclear fission reactor (in case of missing volcanoes).",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions.

The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse.

These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-far-are-we-from-building-our-first-fusion-reactor

This is because terrestrial fusion devices can achieve much higher fusion reaction rates with hydrogen isotopes like Deuterium or Tritium.Fusion experiments employ a range of underlying technolgies, and some types of fusion have safety liabilities - but more in the way of industrial accidents as opposed to military weapons.Robert Steinhaus's answer to Can scientists experimenting with fusion create a disaster?Robert Steinhaus's answer to Is a nuclear fusion reactor safe?Some conventional non-nuclear fusion safety problem areas-First generation fusion systems will initially struggle to produce reliable electrical power. Fusion reactors tend to be more complex than current fission reactors or fossil fuel power plants. Greater fusion power plant complexity could initially in the first couple of decades of operation tend to translate into unpredictable breakdowns and unplanned outages in power generation. Breakdowns in power generation can damage sensitive electronics and injure delicate loads on the grid that require smooth predictable electrical power without dropouts or transients and in some cases, this can produce a safety problem.- Many fusion experiments utilize very high voltages while producing fusion conditions in plasma. Fusion nuclear workers can be subject to potentially fatal non-nuclear electrical shock while installing and maintaining high voltage systems.Robert Steinhaus's answer to What are some of the negatives of nuclear fusion?It is possible that neutrons produced by commercial fusion reactors could be used to breed fissile fuels for conventional atomic weaponsThere is a small risk that early fusion reactors could be used to manufacture weapons materials for conventional fission and fission-fusion bombs.Fusion reactors operating using DT or DD fusion reactions are abundant sources of cheap neutrons. If fertile nuclear fuels like Thorium or U238 are placed in a breeding blanket surrounding the fusion chamber, weapons materials like U233 or Pu239 can be produced using abundant fusion neutrons. It should be possible to provide safeguards to prevent this, but periodic inspection of fusion reactors by IAEA nuclear inspectors may be necessary to ensure DT and DD fusion reactors are not used to breed fissile materials used to make conventional atomic bombs.Safeguard Requirements for Fusion Power PlantsPure fusion weaponsGiven the ingenuity of man, there is unfortunately some chance that pure fusion technology with entirely peaceful intensions could at some point be applied first to peaceful industrial explosives for excavation and mining and then at some point be redirected toward some form of pure fusion weapon. It is possible to kill with the energy releassed in burning a gallon of automotive gasoline. Practical fusion systems that release commercial energy are likely to have some hazards associated with them. Engineered safety systems will probably be needed to ensure the safety of fusion power plants and ensure the public is fully protected from all hazards.It should be noted that the development of pure fusion weapons is not an entirely negative prospect.Pure fusion weapons would retain many of the advantages of fusion (the majority of fusion fuels arecompletely nonradioactive and the nuclear waste pure fusion produces is only nonradioactive Hellium and free neutrons with an averagee lifetime of only about 15 minutes before they decay into harmless subatomic particles).Pure fusion weapons would in fact be a significant moral advance if people in the future continue to rely on explosive weapons to deter war.A pure fusion weapon can be designed to produce minimal (perhaps no) fallout or fission products at all. It is fallout that presents a long term hazard to life following use of conventional nuclear fission or fission-fusion weapons. Most of the fallout actually results from the fission side of current bombs. A pure fusion weapon could produce a significant (large) release of energy but the long term environmental impacts of use of pure fusion weapons can be designed to be very short term in effect (days with protective equipment and a few weeks without protective equipment). In contrast fission and fission-fusion weapons designs can spread fallout widely and that fallout can be hazardous to humans for hundreds to thousands of years.If mankind insists on retaining nuclear weapons, is would probably be in the interests of everyone on the planet and for all future generation to insist that all weapons retained for national defense be pure fusion weapons producing minimal fallout and minimal long term environmental impact.Note1:DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment.

But rocks can be had from the nearest quarries and people know how to make all kinds of weapons far more easily.Here’s a photo of the very first thermonuclear fusion bomb ever to be tested, in the Ivy Mike shot. It used liquid deuterium fuel. This is a close up shot of the device. You can see that it is contained in a large building. You can see the scale by looking at the man sitting there, and the other man standing at a work table on the far right of the frame.The horizontal tubes heading to the right are instrumentation devices. The giant vertical can contains the bomb. This device yielded 10.5 megaton TNT. Here’s a picture of the mushroom cloud from the explosion, taken from an observation aircraft from many, many miles away.You can see that it was a very successful explosion.But this was by no means a deliverable weapon. Your enemies are simply not going to let you spend months to a year, building, in one of their cities, a very large structure with associated control circuitry, and then allow you to fill it up with liquid deuterium, and then just detonate it. They are going to, inevitably, ask some pointed questions of you first …So a lot of research was left for the US bomb developers to turn this into a weapon. This was done and the designs were tested in the Castle series of nuclear weapons tests, one of which, Castle Bravo, turned out - completely unexpectedly - to be the largest yield test ever done in the US weapons testing program. Here’s a picture of that device, which was called SHRIMP. Instead of liquid deuterium, it used solid lithium deuteride as the source of fusion fuel and had a considerably more compact design using lighter metals and better explosives.It was much smaller and lighter than the device in Ivy Mike but still, at 10.5 tonnes, and 4.5 m long by 1 m in diameter, it was considered too heavy and too large to be practically deliverable by bomber. The Air Force insisted on smaller designs, and eventually these were made. For ICBMs, when they were finally built, still smaller and lighter warheads were required.The first H-bomb that was, practically, deliverable by air, may have been the RDS-37, designed mostly by Andrei Sakharov, and reportedly yielding about 3 MT. It was dropped from a Tupolev bomber in November 1955 in the initial test at Semipalatinsk. By all reports it operated on similar principles to the Teller-Ulam design that was tested in the Ivy Mike shot and it was also a lithium deuteride based weapon like the Castle Bravo device.Now, here is a mockup cutaway drawing of the ITER tokamak, the device that will, hopefully, sustain aIt has very strong magnets that confine and heat a rather dilute tritium/deuterium plasma. The key purpose of the design here is to confine that plasma for as long as possible and to heat the plasma as much as possible, so that the fusion rate, and so the generated power, will be high enough to balance or exceed the power that has to be put in to achieve the heating and confinement.But such a reactor is simply not designed to explode, and it cannot explode in a thermonuclear explosion.There is a lot of energy stored in the magnetic field of such a fusion reactor, and if the superconductors making that field were suddenly quenched, it could likely create a big mechanical explosion, destroying maybe even the whole complex as a result. So this is certainly an engineering contingency that has to be planned for by the designers. But the hot dilute plasma would instantly leak away in that case. There would be no uncontrolled runaway fusion explosion. There could not be.So there is no practical sense in which such a test fusion reactor can ever be made into a weapon, none that I can see.It is already well-known to people who are expert on it, how to make thermonuclear weapons, fusion based weapons. A fusion reactor is a completely different kind of animal.Oh, and as for using fast neutrons from deuterium/tritium fusion reactions to produce plutonium from natural uranium, or uranium-233 from thorium-232, that is theoretically possible, but it still doesn’t make even a working fusion reactor into a weapon. Anyways breeding fissile isotopes for use in fission bombs is by now very easily done using conventional, quite standard nuclear fission reactors, followed by chemical processing. This is also very far from being easy to do, due to the radiation dangers, but it can certainly be accomplished given a sufficiently talented and well-trained team, and the right equipment. It would be far easier to get neutrons for this purpose from other, much easier and cheaper to build sources, but still very intense sources, than to get neutrons from a prototype fusion reactor.If you want to design a weapon, then you set out to design a weapon, not a fusion reactor.And the quickest way to do that design is to buy or obtain help from a government that has done it already, and which for its own reasons, is willing to offer help.It turns out that designing fusion reactors is actually far more difficult than designing fusion weapons.",458 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,823,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-far-are-we-from-building-our-first-fusion-reactor
