1,"The fission fragments never leave the fuel rod in virtually all reactor designs. Since they are in the fuel rod, they get buried with the fuel rod.In fact, it is the fission fragments that emit virtually all the radiation (the uranium is only mildly radioactive). If you remove the fission fragments you could continue to use the fuel. That is called reprocessing.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-only-way-to-harvest-energy-and-turn-it-in-electricity-heating-up-things-and-using-steam-engines-Why-dont-we-have-a-more-efficient-complicated-way-of-harvesting-energy-like-from-nuclear-fission-than-using-a

5,"Why is it more daunting to produce energy by nuclear fusion than by nuclear fission?Thank you for the interesting question Oliver.To put it simply, the sustainable fission of certain isotopes, (ie.

With enriched Uranium, the splitting of nuclei by the correct-energy neutrons, releases energy and more neutrons which in turn split more nuclei.Nuclear fusion requires enormous pressures and temperatures to overcome the repulsion of nuclei, all of which are positively charged. To force the nuclei together, the heat and pressure needed are far greater than any known materials can contain, so the reaction would vaporize its own container. Many ingenious designs using electromagnets and other approaches are being tried, but at this time, all demand more energy than the fusion reaction can produce.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-only-way-to-harvest-energy-and-turn-it-in-electricity-heating-up-things-and-using-steam-engines-Why-dont-we-have-a-more-efficient-complicated-way-of-harvesting-energy-like-from-nuclear-fission-than-using-a
6,"Put simply it’s because to get fusion to happen you have to work against the tremendous force that causes and releases so much energy in fission.This force is the electrostatic repulsion between protons. In a fissile nucleus you have a large number of like polarity protons crushed extremely close together in a tiny nucleus, repelling each other and so trying to tear apart this nucleus. The strong force “glue” between adjacent pairs of nucleons is only just enough to hold it together. So it doesn’t take much disruption to split such a nucleus, resulting in a lot of that pent up energy in the rePut simply it’s because to get fusion to happen you have to work against the tremendous force that causes and releases so much energy in fission.This force is the electrostatic repulsion between protons.

The strong force “glue” between adjacent pairs of nucleons is only just enough to hold it together. So it doesn’t take much disruption to split such a nucleus, resulting in a lot of that pent up energy in the repulsion between protons being released. This is where all the energy release in nuclear fission comes from. To make things even easier, this disruption is readily available in the form of a speeding neutron which is very conveniently released by a nearby nuclear split, causing a chain reaction. It’s a bomb waiting to happen, just requiring sufficient fissile material to be in one place.But with fusion you have to force a pair of protons together against this tremendous repulsive force between them. It’s only a single pair when you’re fusing helium, but you’re still working against the same repulsive force that yields so much energy in fission. The goal in this case is the large amount of energy released when you finally manage to overcome the proton repulsion and get the four nucleons close enough together for the strong force to take over and glue them together. But the barrier you have to overcome to get there is huge. And there's no chain reaction to help you in this case, it’s all just brute force that’s required.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-nuclear-fission-plant-on-earth

10,"The simple answer is that there are two processes for releasing the energy of the nucleus of the atom, fission and fusion. Fission means tearing apart, and fusion means pressing together. The heaviest atoms, Uranium and Plutonium are split through fission to release energy, and the lightest atoms, specifically Hydrogen, are fused together to release energy. Therefore, the fusion weapon which uses Hydrogen for it’s fusible element, is called the hydrogen bomb.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,823,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-only-way-to-harvest-energy-and-turn-it-in-electricity-heating-up-things-and-using-steam-engines-Why-dont-we-have-a-more-efficient-complicated-way-of-harvesting-energy-like-from-nuclear-fission-than-using-a
11,"In a Teller-Ulam type device, a small primary nuclear explosive is placed inside a Hohlraum (cavity). The primary, when it detonates, first begins to radiate X-rays from its surface, with an energy on the order of 20 keV, corresponding to a temperature of about 200,000,000 K, into the Hohlraum, which is filled with some low-Z material, typically said to be some sort of plastic foam holding the other components of the bomb in place.The low-Z material is very quickly rendered into fully ionized plasma at about the temperature of the X-rays from the primary.The secondary, which contains the fusioIn a Teller-Ulam type device, a small primary nuclear explosive is placed inside a Hohlraum (cavity). The primary, when it detonates, first begins to radiate X-rays from its surface, with an energy on the order of 20 keV, corresponding to a temperature of about 200,000,000 K, into the Hohlraum, which is filled with some low-Z material, typically said to be some sort of plastic foam holding the other components of the bomb in place.The low-Z material is very quickly rendered into fully ionized plasma at about the temperature of the X-rays from the primary.The secondary, which contains the fusion fuel, is surrounded by a tamper of high-Z material, and the walls of the Hohlraum are composed of a large mass of some high-Z material. Suddenly the walls of the cavity and the tamper are in contact with fully ionized plasma at 200,000,000 degrees. X-rays of such energies are sufficient to partially ionize and impart significant momentum to atoms of the high-Z material, typically lead or uranium, easily tearing the ionized atoms away from the material. As a result atoms are rapidly ablated from all of the surfaces of high-Z material that are exposed to the plasma, causing rapid jets of material to enter the plasma.At the same time a tremendous amount of momentum is transferred in the opposite direction, causing huge pressure. This compresses the secondary enormously and also begins to cause the walls of the Hohlraum to expand outwards.The compression is very, very fast and it generates tremendous heat and pressure in the fusion fuel, which then satisfies the Lawson criterion, and begins to fuse rapidly, releasing copious fast neutrons as well as much more heat. These fast neutrons can be used to cause fission of uranium included as the high-Z tamper or in the core of the secondary. This greatly increases the energy yield.Eventually the Hohlraum expands too much, and the temperature and pressure both drop as it expands. So finally the fusion cuts off. Then, finally, the fireball reaches the outer skin of the bomb. Everything is vaporized, and the development of the fireball in the atmosphere continues in a very complex manner.The fission primary produces a very efficient compression of the fusion fuel which heats it and makes it denser. That is the basic mechanism that starts the fusion reaction. That’s why it is called a thermonuclear weapon.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

12,"It is widely suggested that there are two types of fusion —Are there in reality two types of fusion?It is widely perceived that that there is a category of uncontrolled nuclear fusion where vast amount of energy are released in a manner that so far mankind has mostly used for causing destruction — the hydrogen bomb is an example. The majority of people today consider “uncontrolled nuclear fusion” as something that cannot be used for constructive purposes.It is widely perceivedIt is widely suggested that there are two types of fusion —Are there in reality two types of fusion?It is widely perceived that that there is a category of uncontrolled nuclear fusion where vast amount of energy are released in a manner that so far mankind has mostly used for causing destruction — the hydrogen bomb is an example. The majority of people today consider “uncontrolled nuclear fusion” as something that cannot be used for constructive purposes.It is widely perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily and smoothly so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, in continuously burning Magnetic Confinement fusion reactors like the international ITER experiment and the planned follow on DEMO Magnetic Confinement demonstration power plant that is expected to one day produce commercial electricity.But is there really a difference (or is it just a difference in perception?)The reality is that the distinction between controlled and uncontrolled fusion is an artificial one devised by early fusion project managers at the Atomic Energy Commission during the mid-1950s during the height of the cold war in an effort to try to win over greater public support for their peaceful fusion reactor projects. AEC managers knew that the public deeply feared the newly invented H-bomb fusion weapons and that some market stratagem was needed to distinguish and separate in the public’s mind explosive H-bombs that they knew the public feared and the peaceful fusion reactors which they wanted to acquire the public’s funding support for. Early politically savvy AEC fusion program managers hit on the idea that we can propose the existence of two different types of fusion (controlled and uncontrolled) when in fact there is just fusion and depending on the specific fusion conditions and the amount of fusion fuel used, will produce a more or less rapid fusion burn and release of energy.Even in thermonuclear weapons, fusion actually produces a rapid thermonuclear burn of plasma versus a neutron driven exponentially increasing chain reaction as in the case of nuclear fission.While the density of the plasma and the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are also all the same.Inertial Confinement Fusion produces fusion power in a series of discrete small controlled controlled bursts of fusion energy. Magnetic Confinement fusion devices like tokamaks attempt to produce smooth controlled thermonuclear burns of plasma, but in reality, no tokamak device has operated producing near to engineered power for more than about five seconds before the plasma containment is lost and the fusion device has to be shut down. Today’s Tokamaks including ITER typically employ a electrical transformer or solenoid to produce an intense plasma current that heats the plasma to fusion conditions. Use of such a transformer drive limits the operation of smooth burning tokamaks to periods of no more than a few hundred seconds or less - even in the very best case.So while the marketing spin is that Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments that produce fusion power in a series of short intense controlled bursts are BAD (explosive – nasty-dangerous), the reality is that ICF fusion can be just as safe and reliable as smooth burning MCF fusion experiments that in reality actually produce power in irregular pulses of unpredictable length of not more than a few hundred seconds in length (best case).","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-nuclear-fission-plant-on-earth
