I'd rephrase it as “twice the size of a man"" or something.If you want to include numbers, we need more. Velocity or more accurately acceleration is key in sci-fi space combat. Force is equal to mass times acceleration. You have a rough size of your projectile, with its shape and composition you could gauge it's mass. Acceleration, and in space/sci-fi it's all about relative acceleration, depends on how you're firing the projectile (is it fired like a gun, does it have a rocket for continuous acceleration, railgun, some combination), and the velocity of both ships. If the projectile fires at 100m/s from a stationary ship and hits the enemy ship traveling at 99m/s in the same direction as the round, the net velocity is only 1m/s…not likely to do alot of damage. This then would effect tactics and ranges. So would need to be considered. Finally, payload. Is it a solid slug only doing kinetic damage? Does it have explosives? Radiation? Bio or Chem weapons? Heat? Electromagnetic pulse? Nuclear? All of these will add to the damage done by the projectile. They will do damage in different ways and be countered differently.A projectile that size could reasonably be expected to hit hard, you're basically throwing a truck at the target. But if you want to go “pure"" sci-fi, you need alot more information. How fast everything is moving will be a place to start. Otherwise, big heavy projectile moving fast is enough, you show how powerful it is when it hits something. If you don't mention the numbers, no one will care. They will see big bullet and big damage and accept that. What I would avoid is splitting the difference, if you give people a seed of “pure"" sci-fi style information then ignore it, or worse, contradict it, then you'll have people poking holes.",31 followers,Eric Gates,1.3K,153,560.9K,https://www.quora.com/In-my-sci-fi-war-novel-my-space-battleships-use-a-gun-that-fires-a-projectile-600-mm-long-by-300-mm-in-diameter-Would-this-be-a-fairly-powerful-gun

In real life, spacecraft have what is called Whipple shield that dissipates the impact energy of a tiny meteoroid which could otherwise punch holes in the spacecraft:A 300x600 mm projectile is definitely going to destroy any modern spacecraft, but it’s not necessarily that powerful assuming it is launched at realistic (far below the speed of light) speeds. In comparison, modern tank guns have a caliber of 120 mm. World War 2 battleships main guns typically have a caliber of 350–400 mm (14 to 16 inches). Modern anti-aircraft guns have a caliber between 20–30 mm typically.As for how powerful it is in your setting, you know it better than anyone else. In settings like Halo or Star Wars, this kind of projectile might be laughable.

Now there are three pairs.Of these three pairs two in the third month are now fertile and one is not yet fertile, thus at the end of the next month two more pairs of rabbits are added, so now there exist altogether five pairs.Of these five pairs, three in turn become pregnant, so that in the fourth month there are eight pairs.To find out how many pairs of rabbits there are, Fibonacci observed, all you have to do is in each case to add up the sum of the pairs of rabbits of the two previous months.To begin with there is one pair of rabbits. After one month there are two pairs, after two months there is one plus two, or three pairs, after three months two plus three, or five, after four months three plus five, or eight and so on – until after eleven months 233 pairs of rabbits have resulted from the first pair.And Fibonacci writes:""When finally the 144 pairs are added to those born in the last month, in the end there are 377 pairs. And the above-mentioned pair have finally produced that many pairs at the end of one year.""Although Fibonacci's thought-experiment is based, of course, on unrealistic assumptions, it does describe the essential features of growth processes.While for Fibonacci his problem was thus solved, it was later discovered that the Fibonacci sequence also occurs in nature and in art – be it in the position of leaves of plants, in the spiral form of molluscs, in the structure of clouds in an area of low pressure and in paintings, the architecture of buildings and in music.It is also possible to approach the Fibonacci numbers geometrically.Let us assume a square whose sides measure 1. Beside it we construct a second square of the same size. We attach another square to it, which has the length 2. To this is added a square with the length of the side 3, one with a length of the side 5, one with the length of the side 8.It is not difficult to recognise the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.Now we draw a quadrant in each square.The resultant a spiral called “The Fibonnaci spiral”.It can be clearly seen in the shell of the nautilus.in the leaf arrangement in plants,the pattern of the florets of a flower, the bracts of a pinecone,the scales of a pineapplein your finger bonein the galaxiesin your fingerprintto your hair whorlSo back to your question: Is the Universe intelligently designed?I say it is.Francis Bacon, the famous philosopher said that “Fibonacci and the sunflowerAll this is called “The fingerprint of God” and we are the detectives at the crime scene.God left proof in various forms that he exists.Who says my God has to fit some atheists criteria to exist?",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,31.5K,996,155.4M,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-scientists-been-successful-in-simulating-a-universe-with-intelligent-life

Those guys download the Linux kernel source code and other needed source code and rather than installing a pre-made Linux distribution they make their own Linux ‘distribution’ that is highly modified and specialised for the specific hardware used in the supercomputer.Linux is configurable to an atomic level. There are things so deeply ingrained even down into the actual Linux kernel that are configurable , so much so that the average Windows user would probably never even believe that something like that could be configured. Of course configuring stuff like that is not and probably never will be user friendly. In Linux you can literally activate and deactivate parts of the operating system, then you just recompile the kernel. This will reduce the memory footprint of your kernel once it is compiled.And while we are talking about compiling, when compiling source code you are literally allowed to give compilation parameters to the compiler program, even and especially when you are compiling crucial code like the kernel. You can tell the compiler to optimise the code for more speed but less stability or for more stability but less speed. You can even specify the exact CPU and GPU down to the model number of your CPU and/or GPU, so the compiler will optimize the code specifically for your hardware. This will save precious CPU cycles when you will start using your computer. And you can even open up your text editor and modify the source code yourself(but everything except this is how far you can go even without being a programmer).Now let me explain how minute details you can modify on Linux, once you get the skills to do it(if ever). Let me explain it with a car analogy.Imagine if you could customize your car to an atomic level?And basically that is why most supercomputers use Linux. They need a operating system that they can modify to an atomic level, so that they can squeeze out every single bit of performance out of their hardware down to the very last CPU cycle.You maybe maybe might get a small glimpse of the process if you learn your Linux skills enough that you become able to install the Gentoo Linux distribution without using too many shortcuts, or if you buy the ‘Linux from scratch’ book and build your own LFS system.",38 followers,Scott Rainey,2.3K,2.5K,6.3M,https://www.quora.com/In-my-sci-fi-war-novel-my-space-battleships-use-a-gun-that-fires-a-projectile-600-mm-long-by-300-mm-in-diameter-Would-this-be-a-fairly-powerful-gun
