5,"While Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency, it is only one of approximately 2,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation today. All of the heavily traded cryptocurrencies are powered by some version of a distributed ledger (blockchain), and each has at least one unique attribute that differentiates it. Here's an overview of 5 popular cryptocurrencies and how they compare to Bitcoin.NoteWhile Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency, it is only one of approximately 2,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation today. All of the heavily traded cryptocurrencies are powered by some version of a distributed ledger (blockchain), and each has at least one unique attribute that differentiates it. Here's an overview of 5 popular cryptocurrencies and how they compare to Bitcoin.Note1. LitecoinValue: $77.39 | Market Cap: $4.43 billion USD as ofLitecoin though many online merchant now accept it as well. As means of paymentLitecoin vs. Bitcoin: Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is easy to buy and sell for cash on mainstream exchanges (like Coinbase), and you can also open a Litecoin debit card for easy use. Its primary advantage over Bitcoin (and the main reason it was created is its faster block generation rate, which means faster transaction confirmations. While Bitcoin transactions tend to take ten plus minutes to settle, Litecoin transactions are often settled in a quarter of that time. Litecoin's Scrypt algorithm also makes mining easier for people without high-end graphics cards.2. EthereumValue: $445.92 | Market Cap: $44.9 billion USDOne of the most popular uses of Ether is to purchase shares in intial coins offering (ICOs).Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Rather than simply mining Ethereum, miners must work to earn Ether. Another major difference between the two is how they use blockchain. Bitcoin uses blockchain to record immutable records of transactions, while Ethereum uses it to create decentralized computational platforms, which enable Distributed Applications (DApps) and smart contracts to be built and run without third-party interference, fraud, or downtime.3. DashValue: $227.73 | Market Cap: $1.88 billion USDDash's primary use (much like Bitcoin) is as a cryptocurrency, with more than 1400 merchant accepting it as a form of payment. Dash offers instant transactions (called InstantSend) and private transactions (PrivateSend). Dash powers these transactions through a two-tier network of nodes and Masternodes; as mining and transactions are powered by separate networks, transactions take only a few seconds.Dash vs. Bitcoin: Considering its ambitions to be a primary form of currency, Dash aims to be both cheaper and faster than Bitcoin. In my own way i say Dash is ""what Bitcoin should have been."") Unlike other cryptocurrencies on this list, Dash is not a fork of Bitcoin, but rather uses its own blockchain and mining system.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Is-cryptocurrency-mining-profitable-in-the-USA
