The software and hardware to do so was actually installed while the craft were en route to Jupiter. The same was true at Saturn, and Uranus, and Neptune.We had radio telescopes that would have been capable of receiving the Voyager signals, but they were being used for astronomy, not for receiving broadcasts from spacecraft. It was actually the Voyager project that really created the ‚ÄúDeep Space‚Äù part of the Deep Space Network of radio telescopes to receive their signals from the Jupiter and Saturn Flybys. (The Deep Space Network was created in 1958 in preparation for the manned Gemini, Mercury, and Apollo missions, with stations in Canberra, Australia, Madrid, Spain, and the Goldstone Deep Space Communication Complex near Fort Irwin, which is close to Barstow, California.)As Voyager went further into the outskirts of the Solar System, the DSN grew from each site having one 34 meter dish, to what it is now, with each of the sites deploying a 70 meter dish and two 34 meter dishes either singly, or in an array, and with the ability to call in favors (observing time) at places like the VLA (Very Large Array) or the Parkes observatory to create virtual telescopes hundreds of kilometers across for picking up the vanishingly faint signal from Voyager more than 100 AU away.(The DSN site in Madrid, Spain, with the new 70 meter dish antennas.)The Deep Space Network has been continuously improved over the last 60 plus years, although the 70 meter dishes added in 1990 for the Voyager Interstellar mission are still roughly the same now as then, because they were sized to receive the signals until 2025. But even now there are plans afoot for improvements well into the 2020‚Äôs. One of those will actually be removing the 70 meter dishes and replacing them with a new, more advanced 35 meter dish which can actually receive better than the now 30 year old 70 meter dishes. No advancements in technology, seriously?Part of the advancement is also the massive increase in computer processing technology that can coax the signal out of the noise of the background, which has actually been done using even as small as a 20 meter dish, but over a long period of time.Voyager broadcasts at 19 watts, about the same as your typical cell tower. It broadcasts in the 8.4 Ghz range, which is a hydrogen clear band. It‚Äôs currently transmitting at 160 bits per second. Doing the math‚Ä¶The 3.7M high-gain antenna directs nearly 100% of the energy of the transmitter back to Earth. Conversely, a radio tower broadcasts in a 360 degree circle (actually a half-sphere, in three dimensions) meaning its signal drops by the inverse square law. The boost of the high-gain antenna is standard math in physics:With a tight-beam signal, the inverse square law drops out, and instead we have path losses.So, the final signal back at Earth is coming in at about -240dB, a ridiculously small number.Technological advances over the intervening 42 years have made it possible for us to extract the signal out of the noise, and continue to talk with Voyager. If you think there hasn‚Äôt been any advances in radio astronomy or detecting low power transmissions in the last 42 years (during which time, cell phones went from car-trunk filling boxes, to five pound bricks, to 5mm thick super-computers [in 1970‚Äôs terms] with talk times of 20 hours) then you haven‚Äôt been paying any attention.","35,112 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.2K,12.3K,142.4M,https://www.quora.com/Are-desktop-computers-allowed-in-hostels-Should-I-take-them-to-a-hostel

There are limitations.Have you ever watched ‚ÄúFastest Car‚Äù on Netflix? In this show 3 older cars, which are partly insanely upgraded are racing a modern supercar. The premise is ‚ÄúDavid versus Goliath‚Äù but in reality the super car is mostly the underdog - because it is not purpose built and it has to be an allrounder while the ‚Äúsleepers‚Äù are mostly built as drag-machines - and often the owners spent more money (especially if you factor man-hours) into their mostly ugly old-timers than the supercar owner.Analog you can upgrade an old jet. Can give it new avionics, engines and weapons. But there are physical limitations- and you end up with a compromise. Because the jet has been built for a specific purpose.Let‚Äôs make an example: The Mig-21 is relatively small. Even compared to a relatively small F-16, the difference is directly recognizable.However modern avionics - is it only a sophisticated radar (AESA) needs space in the nose. First big problem.Other flight systems need also some space. New sensors, new computer systems etc are also making the plane heavier. Hence the window of additional payload becomes also smaller.Aerodynamics is another point. The window of superior performance of a MiG-21 is far smaller than the one in the F-16. But then even a F-16 is known, that it (almost) cannot be trumped in high speed turn circles - however is vulnerable in lower speed high AoA.We also have to talk about budget. The problem is, that the integration of technology and the technology itself has quite a cost. Let‚Äôs quickly talk about the highest specced F-15 (EX). The cost per muster with the latest AESA radar, with some sensors (not comparable to the F-35), with cockpit upgrades (helmet cueing system but no DAS as in the F-35) - it would cost about $86mil - the F-35A cost inclusive stealth and all even more advanced systems and about $80mil.The point is, that we have learned a lot of lessons, when it comes to strategy, to aerodynamics etc. in the last 60 or so years. The development of new musters is so expensive as well as so difficult (set backs, delays), because systems become more complex - insanely complex. However you end up with jets, which are vastly more effective.Don‚Äôt get fooled by some people who show the stats and want to sell, that older jets are faster, have a better turn radius etc. The bigger picture and force multipliers are more important - because war is no Top Trump card game.","3,097 followers",N2X,505,240,3.7M,https://www.quora.com/Are-desktop-computers-allowed-in-hostels-Should-I-take-them-to-a-hostel

12,"If the airframe has decent life left in it a country may seek to upgrade the jet with better systems to keep it in service.

It takes a lot of effort to validate the install of new hardware and to get it to play nice with everything else. Different wiring standards, different voltages, different data formats, etc. In modern fighters a significant fraction of the cost is the black boxes in the bays and the sensors, not the engine or the airframe. A new radar and cockpit can cost more than a new engine.Jets like the MiG-21 are hard to refit because, well, it‚Äôs small. Not a lot of room to put stuff without substantially redesigning the airframe. Space for radar is very limited, the size of the hole at the back and the hole in the front limit what engines you can install, fuel tank layout has issues, there‚Äôs just not a lot of room inside to put stuff and practically none outside to hang stuff on.But spending $3M per aircraft from Elbit Systems is still cheaper than a used F-16. The question to be answered is the difference in capability worth it? You aren‚Äôt getting F-16 capabilities for a MiG-21 price but you can get several updated MiG-21s for the cost of one F-16.But many nations keep the older jets in their fleets. Mainly for lack of money for anything better. MiG-17/19/21 fighters are simple and rugged and can be kept flying for quite a while. Air forces who have bought later, more complex aircraft on the cheap like the MiG-29 have found keeping them flying is much harder. Fall out of favor with Russia or don‚Äôt produce hard currency on schedule and your overhaul contract suddenly takes a couple more years to complete. Or the spares you were waiting for just don‚Äôt show up. Cheap to purchase does not equate to cheap to operate. Russia is a lot more finicky than the West when it comes to aftersales support.The USA will support what it sells and builds that into the contract and exchange agreements. You‚Äôve got to really piss off the USA for them to tell GE or Pratt and Whitney to hold off on those engine spares. Contracts in the USA tend to be honored even when we‚Äôre not happy with the contractee. Russia has been known to play more fast-and-loose with commitments on defense support.However I‚Äôd argue that if you have the money to spend on newer jets, you will. The trend has been towards Western jets because countries have come to realize they want best bang for the buck and a big part of that bang is time between overhauls and reliability. Russian stuff is rugged and mostly reliable but it is not across the board. Russia turbofan overhaul schedules and lifespan are nowhere near that of Western engines. Sorry, it‚Äôs a fact. Western engines are more powerful pound-for-pound and have greater durability. The vaunted ruggedness of Russian airframes is great if you‚Äôre planning to operate from a dirt strip but most air forces lay down concrete and build bases like everyone else. Now all that rough field support is just added weight and complexity.Russian weapons are mix of phenomenal and meh. Some of their capabilities were ahead of the West but the problem was it was hampered by poor integration with the avionics and pilot workload. They‚Äôve done a lot of effort to bring those standards up but when it comes to sensors and integration, Western aircraft are far better. Any advantages Russia had in the 1990s are largely gone now.And for all the love of the Su-27 and its airshow aerobatics, learn the difference between airshow and combat. Any Su-27 pilot dumb enough to bleed that much energy and allow an enemy into visual range to watch the show deserves a 20mm swatch pattern in their fuselage or a 9 X-Ray colonoscopy.And the one area where people want to pay to play is stealth and in that there is the United States and then nobody else. And per above, it is a fully integrated package. Love or hate the F-35 if you want but everyone who can afford them wants them. If the jet sucked that much why are nations clamoring to get these things? They‚Äôre going to build thousands of them. You don‚Äôt build thousands of something that expensive just to get taken down by an uprated MiG-21. Those with the F-35 know the truth and so do those with the MiG-21s. They know in the face of stuff like the F-22 and F-35 their air force is just a target list.In the end you have good, cheap and capable.

(Justice League Of America Vol. 2 #27)While the comparison of Bruce Lee and Usain Bolt does make sense when talking about humans, the same logic does not apply to Superman.Think about it. The man travels between galaxies. If his reaction time does not match his speed, and he is one second too late at pulling the brakes, boom. A planet destroyed by a human bullet travelling at lightspeed. That paired with his combat training (which most people seem to forget), and in terms of reaction time, he‚Äôs got wonder woman beat by a mile.As such, he can just dodge any magical weapon she throws at him (which he knows to do after knowing WW for years) and lay some heavy hits to take her down.Batman:Is there any way Batman could defeat a fully fledged Superman?Shazam:(Justice League Vol 2 #22)Takes a hit from an angry Shazam, shrugs it off fairly easily. Seems like the magic part isn‚Äôt that much of a factor. Other Superman/Shazam fights have been pretty close as well. He‚Äôs got a good chance.Martian Manhunter:Guy vs. MMSame Guy vs. Superman (Superman (1987) #175)Superman‚Äôs more powerful. While MM‚Äôs other abilities may even the odds, but I feel the pyrophobia (fear of fire that MM has) will negate any advantage they bring him, since Superman, y‚Äôknow, SHOOTS FIRE FROM HIS EYES!!!Cyborg:Got the gadgets, not the speed or firepower. Straightforward enoughFlash:Tough one. Apparently, he can hit harder than Supes. He‚Äôs way faster to boot. However, his Super reaction evidently isn‚Äôt always on, given his displays of less than ‚Äúattosecond‚Äù reaction time. If Superman can catch him off guard, he might win.Aquaman:Don‚Äôt care what anyone says, or what any rebirth title might have you believe, Superman is stronger. Like tectonic plate shifter vs. Planet mover stronger. He wins.Green Lantern:Another hard one. I don‚Äôt know GL feats that well, and the strength of his constructs vary. I‚Äôll put it in the maybe column.And there you have it. It isn‚Äôt guaranteed, but he has a good shot, better than anyone else, except maybe the flash. Of course, I am a super-biased Superman fanboy, but at the very least I make an attempt to back my claims with logic, reasoning, and evidence.Cheers!P.S.: Never let anyone tell you that Superman sucks.",350 followers,Tevin Boateng,679,308,3.5M,https://www.quora.com/Are-desktop-computers-allowed-in-hostels-Should-I-take-them-to-a-hostel
