2,"There are two main reasons that ships built in the first half of the 20th century tended to have their guns mounted two, three, and sometimes even as much as four per turret.The first is the issue ofThere are two main reasons that ships built in the first half of the 20th century tended to have their guns mounted two, three, and sometimes even as much as four per turret.The first is the issue ofIn the early 20th century, battleships starting with HMS Dreadnought transitioned to using centralized control over their armament, using increasingly sophisticated mechanical (and later electromechanical) computers. These were basically giant mechanical calculators, taking in various measurements taken by operators, and spitting out elevation and bearing needed for the guns to hit the target.British Admiralty Fire Control TableHowever, marvels of engineering that they were for their time, they suffered from many limitations - it took significant amounts of time for them to generate a firing solution, many things (such as maneuvers) could confuse them and require recalculation, and above all, they weren’t pinpoint precise, the way we expect our electronic computers to be today. Therefore, the most common practice was to fire weapons in salvos of at least three guns, each weapon set to a slightly different setting, in attempts toThe second is the issue of loading. Before the advent of solid-state electronics made sophisticated automation possible, all the tasks of operating a gun were done manually, with power assist for larger weapons where the ammunition was simply too large and heavy to handle.Fourteen inch shell on USS Texas battleshipStill, that powered handling wasn’tNow, fast forward to the modern world.To begin with, the big guns are long gone. Missiles are far more accurate, have much more range, don’t need a gigantic (and hugely expensive, both to build and to operate) ship to launch from, and if needed, can hit much harder (a shell fired from a battleship main gun typically leaves the muzzle at something like 800m/s and hits the target at around 500m/s; aside from such an exercise being pointless, there is nothing stopping anyone from building a missile that will hit the target at multiple km/s). Guns are basically the sidearm of a modern warship, to be used on occasions that don’t warrant a missile, and nobody carries a gun much larger than five inches anymore.Addressing the point number one - modern fire control is by leaps and bounds more sophisticated than anything that was available to WWI and WWII sailors. The ships are festooned with sensors, providing the fire control computers with volumes of targeting data that is far more accurate than anything provided by the old systems, and the computers themselves have moved from cogs and gears to transistors and microchips, crunching those volumes of data and providing pinpoint accurate firing solutions. In short, there is no more need to fire salvos of shells into a general area where the enemy is, hoping for at least one to hit.Addressing the point number two - modern gun turrets don’t have men in the gunhouse anymore. All the tasks of loading, laying and firing the gun have been automated.Oto Melara Super Rapid 76mm gun turretThis allows even a single gun to produce astonishingly high rates of fire - the 76mm gun above is capable of firing 120 rounds per minute, i.e. two rounds every second, and even the larger 5-inch weapons can reach or exceed 20 rounds per minute. The Soviet/Russian AK-130 is capable of 90 rounds per minute, albeit in a fairly heavy twin-gun mount, so it is ‘only’ 45 rounds per minute per gun. Therefore, the bulky and heavy multiple gun mounts are no longer required, which is just as well, as the freed up space and weight can be more usefully allocated to more missiles.",1 follower,Matt B,979,4.5K,6.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-modern-warships-not-have-multiple-guns-in-their-turrets

Army, Navy and Air Forces around the globe had been increasingly keen to convert their weapon systems from gun based platforms into missile based platforms where ever possible.HMS Edinburgh firing her sea dart surface to air missile.Naval Warfare in the Second World War relied primarily on Naval guns of various size and caliber to fight their surface engagements. Targets for Naval guns commonly includes enemy merchant vessels, warships, surfaced submarines as well as Aircrafts. (Yes, Many WWII Naval guns were designed to be Dual-Purpose)The QF 5.25 inch twin-gun turret on HMS Sirius.Many World War II era warships carried multiple guns in their turrets to ensure maximum firepower available in a single salvo on a particular target area. Carrying multiple guns in a turret helped to save on weight and space on a warships hull as opposed to putting more single-gun turrets on the same size of hull.The French Battleship Dunkerque had her 8 main guns mounted in two quadruple gun turrets in A and B positions. She had a length of 215 meters.This is extremely important for warship construction, as designers were able to make the ship more compact, hence a relatively smaller target. Additionally the saved weigh can be further utilized into a thicker Armour-belt or deck armour to improve general protection.The German Battleship Bismarck was armed with 8 main guns in four twin-gun turrets in A, B, X and Y positions. She was considerably longer than the French Dunkerque at 251 meters despite having the same number of main guns.With the rapid development of missiles in the Cold War, Navies now had Anti-ship missiles, Cruise Missiles and Surface-to-air missiles available in their arsenal.Royal Navy Type 23 frigate utilize American-made Harpoon missiles as her primary anti-ship armament.These guided missiles gave modern warships significantly greater attacking range and accuracy. Since the missiles are able to steer themselves towards the target, the firing ship does not need to angle or expose their hull in order to fire their guns.The missile tubes and vertical launch systems behind the gun turret are the central element of the frigate’s firepower.The success of modern missiles had largely rendered the guns redundant. Modern Naval guns too are progressively improved to be lighter, smaller and more capable to performed rapid sustained fire thanks to advances in automatic gun control.USS Curts frigate was armed with an OTO Melara 76mm/3 inch Naval gun. Most Destroyers of the Second World War carried 4 to 5.5 inch guns. However the later were not armed with any missiles. The former also possess an unusually high rate of fire, 120 rounds per minute.Despite the reduced weigh of the shells fired by modern naval guns, they more than made up for it by their much higher rate of fire. They can deliver more shells down range in the same time period. In this manner, Navies now require less guns on their turrets to arm their ships than the old days.It is vital to point out, Naval guns do at times possess an advantage over missiles. Such as effective coastal fire-support missions and shelling smaller enemy craft and vessels where using missiles would not be cost-effective.This is the end of my answer, thank you for reading.I will continue to add more details to expand my answer.RegardsPHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTED WERE SOURCED FROM IWM COLLECTIONSCOURTESY OF THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM’S NON-COMMERCIAL LICENCE.HMS SHEFFIELD IWM MH27571HMS SIRIUS IWM A23424PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTED WERE SOURCED FROM DEFENCE IMAGERYHMS EDINBURGH FIRING SEA DARTS SAMPHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTED WERE SOURCED FROM UKDEFENCEJOURNALTYPE 23 FRIGATE ARGYLL AT SEATYPE 23 FRIGATE HMS RICHMOND FIRING HARPOONPHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTED WERE SOURCED FROM US NAVYUSS CURTS 76MM GUN EXERCISE CARAT Photograph No. 030718-N-4178C-002PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTED WERE SOURCED FROM BATTLESHIPLISTFRENCH BATTLESHIP DUNKERQUE AT RESTPHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTED WERE SOURCED FROM ASSOCIATED PRESSGERMAN BATTLESHIP BISMARCK",375 followers,Alexander Morphous,1K,200,1.3M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-modern-warships-not-have-multiple-guns-in-their-turrets

5,"Why do modern warships not have multiple guns in their turrets?This is simply not true. Most gun mounts on modern warships either have multiple guns or at least multiple barrels. Let me explain.Most destroyers, Frigates, Corvettes have a main gun situated some where near the bow and almost all of these are single gun mounts. They also usually have 1–4 other gun mounts for anti missile defense. These are either multi barreled or multi gun systems designed to fire at an extremely high rate of fire.AK 630 turret on a Kirov class cruiser showing its 6 barrel configuration.
