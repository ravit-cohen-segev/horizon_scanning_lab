Then Helium-3 is also out of reach and not a feasible option.But breakthroughs have been made using other methods and even materials.Obviously I'm not gonna get too much into details. It's enough if I simply give you the cover and not really the content.One method is based on Nuclear Thermal Power Generation. The method is similar but different. The initial idea was to use fission to achieve fusion. The new method uses a transuranic element, created by exposing a Uranium isotope (233 to 236) to hydrogen+helium at near absolute zero temperatures. Plus intense but specific magnetic fields.This “new” material although still in its testing phase, as revealed great potential to obtain a form of fusion. Where it can produce a form of plasma that it's extremely potent, energetic wise, but not requiring to achieve the extreme temperatures normally required for Fusion.Another method, that has also shown some potential, is the use of a hydrogen superfluid. Where tests have shown that maybe it might be perfect to be used with Electromagnetic Confinement. To achieve controlled nuclear fusion. The best data so far is the scale of the reactor itself and power requirements to start and maintain fusion.Fusion wise that's it. These two are the ones that I see, as the best possible closest solutions, to nuclear Fusion.I know that Lockheed Martin, Compact Fusion reactor, has been on almost every front page of this topic. But seriously. All the data they have shown, points to a working reactor, by around 2050 or 2070. Maybe! Seeing that there's no actual way to verify the data they share. Which is almost none.While the other private sector projects, that I mentioned above, may show results by 2025 to 2030, tops.So I'd say that nuclear fusion, may be closer, than most people believe it to be.But until something is actually made available, we won't know for sure.Although it's good to know that others are working on the problems. Trying to discover a solution.Time will tell, I guess.",825 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-the-future-of-nuclear-fusion

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

7,"Well, it really depends on what the energy source is useful for. Theoretically, if the energy could be harnessed into fuel, electricity, etc. then we may be able to stop global warming for starters. This would only happen if, the new energy didn’t cause pollution. The effects on Earth would be meaningless! Because, we can now colonize everywhere. With infinite energy we can travel to anywhere, if we could use the energy correctly. These effects would be universally impactful, and not so much worldly impactful. The effects would be unimaginable.","5,986 followers",Jens Böttiger,565,2.6K,17.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-the-future-of-nuclear-fusion

We have had fusion for the past 63 years.http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-detailsThe first fusion ‘super’ bomb was built and tested March 1, 1954 in the Pacific Range.This used the Jetter Cycle, a nuclear fuel cycle discovered by Ulrich Jetter in the late 40s. Fission normally takes place by the absorption of a neutron by a fissile material which causes the material to break down and release more neutrons. So, controlling neutron flux by absorption or reflecting lost neutrons back into the pile, controls the power output. That’s because materials heavier than Iron-56 release energy when they break apart.Fusion of course occurs when nuclei lighter than Iron 56 join together to create heavier materials. This is easily seen in the energy per nucleon chart of all isotopes of elements.Jetter looked carefully at the energy per nucleon data accumulated across the periodic table and noticed that Lithium-6 and to a lesser extent Beryllium and Boron, drop in energy dramatically - leaving Helium-4 to form a sort of spike that interrupts the smooth curve.Well, Jetter understood that Lithium-6 readily absorbs a neutron to form a Triton and an Alpha particle - releasing 4.8 MeV. 77.17 TJ/kg of Lithium-6! Of course you need 1/6th kg of neutrons to make that happen. However, Jetter also knew that the Triton had way more energy than needed to fuse with a Deuteron releasing another 17.6 MeV. Another 339.6 TJ/kg of D+T. When Tritium combines with Deuterium you get another Alpha aka Helium-4 and you get your neutron back.Given the way energy and momentum add, most of the energy ends up in the neutron. That can be a good thing because you can put something in that absorbs energetic neutrons and produces more less energetic neutrons - allowing a sort of fission to take place.The net reaction is Lithium-6 plus Deuterium produce 2 Helium-4 plus 22.4 MeV. The net reaction 270.2 TJ/kg of Lithium6Deuteride. a White Powder that’s 0.82 g/cc.Now, the material you put in the mix to manage the production of many low energy neutrons from a single high energy neutron determines how fast the reaction can grow.More on Jetter Cycle here.https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdfSo, if you want to make a hydrogen bomb like Castle Bravo, you need a prompt source of a lot of neutrons, which a fission device provides (the heat and pressure have nothing to do with it).Yet, by 1956 researchers had developed a fission free bomblet that they called “The Humanitarian H-Bomb” and folks began talking about nuclear pulse spaceships. Enthusiasts worked on these things until destroyed by Fake News, needless National Security Classification and innuendo and finally explicitly prohibited by Nuclear Test Ban signed by LBJ. (you will be raided if you accumulate Lithium-6 Deuteride and try to make a reactor).https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00963402.1956.11453741?journalCode=rbul20Aldebaran Nuclear Pulse Spacecraft - source Dandridge Cole - GE Astronautics 1959However, if you use a slow acting material like Zinc-64(n,2n)Zinc-63 that takes 23 minutes after absorbing a neutron to release two neutrons the most you can do is create a pot of molten Lithium 6 Deuteride and Zinc. (mp Li6D 692C, mp Zn 419.5 C) this is perfect! Operating a molten salt reactorhttps://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/28/010/28010511.pdfA molten salt reactor consisting of Lithium-6 Deuteride in combination with powdered Zinc in the right combination, started with a neutron source (Californium) which is an off-the-shelf itemNuclear Reactor Rod Assemblies(NSA) | Frontier Technology Corporation [ https://www.frontier-cf252.com/nuclear-rods/ ]Castle Bravo was the nuclear bomb test. Project Sherwood (still classified) was the nuclear fusion reactor program. The success was so great that Lewis Strauss the chair of the AEC at the time (AEC preceded DoE) when asked about the coming peak oil situation predicted for 1970, said to reporters that by 1970 energy would be ‘too cheap to meter’. Shortly after Strauss was embroiled in a controversy, Fake News of the day, and removed from power. Other enthusiasts scheduled to testify before Congress about commercialising the results of Project Sherwood died in an unfortunate helicopter accident in the Pacific Range during a nuclear test. So, the testimony never took place. The Join Chiefs re-classified the data following the departure of Strauss, and the congressional committee on nuclear fusion began the hot fusion research program we have today.Lewis Strauss after his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - accused of corruption.Lewis Strauss before his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - hero who would bring us the ‘super’ bomb.The world today produces 600,000 tonnes of lithium per year and 45,000 tonnes (7.5%) is lithium-6. Lithium-6 is easily separated from Lithium-7 (which acts as a poison to the Jetter cycle).Deuterium is easily separated from heavy water, which is easily made from sea water. So, humanity can make 60,000 tonnes of Lithium-6 Deuteride at a cost of $480 million - $8 per kg. - $0.48 billion.Humanity spend $6,400 billion on coal, natural gas and crude oil each year. Another $2,000 billion per year is spent by the world’s military to secure supplies of oil.At 270.2 TJ/kg the cost of course is too cheap to meter. The reaction products are 1 kg of Helium-4 for each kg of Li6D. 60,000 tonnes produces 1.621 *10^22 Joules per year. 514.08 TW.Humanity, burning coal, natural gas, and crude oil, produces 17.6 TW of power. So, we produce 29.21x the energy we need from Lithium-6 Deuteride. So, actual cost of fuel is $16.4 million per year.Herman Kahn, futurist for RAND Corporation said of this process that Capitalism would defeat Communism because Capitalism will make all proletariats millionaires by 1990. Interestingly, the promise of making us all millionaires outlined by Milton Friedman, was a large measure of how Capitalism defeated Communism by 1990.The importance of nuclear energy including Lithium-6 was outlined in 1956 by Marion King Hubbert.http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdfOil company executives that advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Eisenhower at the time, thought that high temperature reactors of the type proposed by Jetter were premature.
