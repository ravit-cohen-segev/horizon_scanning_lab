Gas, salt and metals are possible coolants. Some of these reactors can work with current technology and designs. The main problem stopping development of new reactors is the cost and complications of building prototypes.China has started operation of a gas cooled reactor, a They are likely building a Molten Salt Reactor and a Traveling Wave Reactor, TWR. China has also tested a research fusion reactor and created heated plasma twice the temperature of the sun for 100 seconds. But useful Fusion energy is likely decades away.These reactors will be built. Some are under construction. While nuclear power is unpopular there are countries that appreciate the benefits of low carbon and safety. Poor and less developed countries may see nuclear power as part of development of rich countries. Many very powerful countries have nuclear power.Even if reactors are being built in other countries it can still affect its neighbors. So development of safer nuclear power should be of concern to everyone. Even opponents of nuclear power must realize that better nuclear technology is important. China has a huge nuclear energy program building a number of different reactors from different countries. And including Next Generation, Gen 4 reactors. They are planning for over 50 nuclear power stations. They will be able to find which reactors are suitable for their needs.The US has fallen behind in reactor technology. Not being able to develop prototypes. But this may soon change. As the potential for Gen 4 technologies are understood politicians may change their views.The anti-nuclear groups say that investing in Gen 4 technology will be a waste of money and resources. And will take to long to develop. But there is plenty of resources available. We should be spending more money on a variety of low carbon energy-producing technologies. We need many types of energy and to focus only on solar and wind does not guarantee success. Solar and wind energy does face problems. Solar and wind power is not as simple as most people think it is.I am not saying we should start mass production of Gen 4 reactors. But we need to develop working prototypes to test their capabilities. From a technical view these reactors are viable. Most of the technology is available. Some prototypes have been tested before.THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND HISTORY SHOWS HOW SAFE NUCLEAR ENERGY IS. Different from the sensationalized accounts in the media.Some projections it to future energy production are not very good. We need more options. Gen 4 power could be competitive with fossil fuels.

That can be almost anything since fusion will convert mass to energy. But like chemical rockets, fuel is weight — or more correctly, it’sIon Propulsion systemsA big problem is the mass of any ship or probe you send out. Depending on your propulsion system, you will likely need a way of shielding the payload — people or equipment — from any effects of the drive system. One way is to use dense metal shielding (e.g. lead) to stop beta and gamma particles from killing the crew. Another is distance, such as placing the drive system at the rear of a long structure, well away from the payload areas. Either method creates extra mass, either in shielding or long, rigid structures to connect the drive system to the rest of the ship.Complicating FactorsLet’s suppose you could actually achieve 25% ofSo you have to protect the crew.Armor shielding would add far too much mass. A combination of metals, ceramics andYou have the same problems with a probe, though you don’t have the complexities of crew quarters, lavatories, food, water and air supplies. But you still need to shield the delicate and sensitive instruments from “flight damage” as well as shielding systems.Every problem you solve is likely to add unwanted extra mass to the project. This is the kind of problem that drove early spaceflight pioneers to drink. Just to break free of Earth’s gravity required an enormous mass of fuel, adding more mass to be lifted in structures to contain it. Until they broke it down into rocket stages, the problem seemed insurmountable.Now that we’re assuming you’ve run up to 25% of light speed, start thinking of how you willSpace flight is",9 followers,Bill Caffrey,1.3K,3K,16.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about

Well, in meters per second, its about 3 million meters per second, or in more relatable terms, about 6.7 million miles per hour. To put this in perspective, one of the fastest human built objects is the Parker Solar Probe, which achieved speeds of 213,200 miles per hour, or about 3.1% of our 0.01 c speed. What allowed the Parker Solar probe to achieve such incredible speeds, is a combination of several factors, starting with the launch of the spacecraft on a Delta IV Heavy rocketEven with this powerful launch vehicle, it couldn’t have achieved anywhere close to its mission parameters, or breaking the speed record. In order to achieve that, the spacecraft will perform seven flybys of the planet Venus, in order to slowly lower its closest approach to the sun. In January of this year, it passed 19.4 billion meters from the Sun, and it will perform this same flyby in June. In December 2025, the probe will achieve its closest flyby, which is 6.9 billion meters from the Sun’s center or 6.2 billion meters from the Sun’s surface. This is only 9 solar radii away from the Sun, and reach 430,000 miles per hour, or 6% or our target speed.As other answers have pointed out, the first hurdle to achieving 1% of the speed of light is the matter of fuel energy density. Chemical propulsion is nowhere near dense enough to get close, the fastest speeds achieved by chemical rockets is the launch of the New Horizons probe, about 36,400 miles per hour, and that was using an Atlas V, one of the most powerful rockets currently in service. In order to achieve 1% of the speed of light, we’ll need more efficient and more powerful forms of propulsion, and there are quite a few that you could choose from, far too many to mention here.The next hurdle is acceleration. We as humans can only survived sustained g-forces for so long before you start encountering organ failure, you actually reach the point where the structures inside us will literally be torn apart. Accelerations from fractions of 1 g (Earth surface gravity), up to about 2 to 3 g’s would probably be sustainable for a decent amount of time, from months at fractions of g to about 1 to 2 g, from days or hours perhaps of 3 g or so. Once you get into the higher accelerations, the kind usually only experienced in amusement park rides for fractions of a second, or in maneuvers in high speed aircraft, then you get down to less than several hours. Even higher accelerations would require even smaller time frames in order to be survivable. The highest acceleration ever survived by a human being was 46.2 g, and that was only for a fraction of a second.That being said, it wouldn’t take that much acceleration to get to 1% of the speed of light. If you wanted to accelerate at a comfortable 1 g, it would take 305,810 seconds, or 3.51 days. The distance traveled while accelerating at 1 g for that long is just over 4 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. If you accelerated five times faster, or 5g, it would only take 61,652 seconds, or 17 hours, and you would only travel about 62% of the average Earth-Sun distance.As other answers have pointed out, a major problem with traveling at these velocities is debris. This is a problem even with current space travel, and we travel much slower. As you get faster and faster, the relative velocity of debris gets larger and larger, and even the smallest of particles can eventually get deadly. Imagine a grain of sand hitting a target at 3 million meters per second. The kinetic energy of such a projectile would be 1.35 mega Joules, or about the same amount of kinetic energy of a Chevy Tahoe traveling at 67 miles per hour. What makes the grain of sand hitting you even worse than the truck hitting you is that the grain of sand has an incredibly small area. This is what allows small, fast moving projectiles to punch through materials that would easily stop a truck. Any reasonable solution to this problem adds mass, and thereby decreases how quickly you can accelerate to 1% of the speed of light, and also how far you can go based on the amount of fuel you have.Another consideration that needs to be made that other answers have touched upon is that you have to slow down in order to arrive at your destination, unless the destination is traveling at 1% of the speed of light. This is why the most time efficient way of traveling between any two points in space with constant acceleration involves accelerating towards the target for half the journey, and decelerating for the second half. This turns navigational problems into less a consideration of how fast you can get, which in space is rather meaningless, since any object given enough time, acceleration, and fuel can get up to some ridiculously fast speeds, but more a consideration of max acceleration. With a decent long term constant acceleration, you can get anywhere in the inner solar system within a week, anywhere in the solar system in a month, maybe two depending on orbital position. The Moon is about 3 and a half hours, about the same as a long regional flight, say London to Athens.","2,494 followers",Jim Reich,1.4K,6.1K,5.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about

You’ll wind up with an immense pyramid of giant rockets, many miles across at the bottom.Or maybe you switch to a less dense, but higher energy density fuel, like hydrogen instead of kerosene. It will require more volume for the same amount of impulse, but if you work your way through the fairly complex optimization, you can probably mix LH2 and Kerosene to shrink the stack somewhat. Shrink your payload smaller than the Apollo capsule and you’ll do better yet. Maybe it’ll be only a few miles across at the base instead of the size of a mountain. But it’s just not going to work out with chemical propellants.

This supposes that there has been plenty of time for intelligent civilizations to interact within our galaxy when one examines the age and number of stars, as well as the distances between them. Yet, the fact that extra-terrestrial intelligence has never been observed leads to a logical paradox where our observations are inconsistent with our theoretical expectation. This original question from Fermi seemed to also reinforce the prevailing paradigm at the time that interstellar travel was impossible. Project Daedalus was a bold way to examine the Fermi Paradox head on and gave a partial answer – interstellar travel is possible. The basis of this belief was the demonstration of a credible engineering design just at the outset of the space age that could in theory, cross the interstellar distances. In the future scientific advancement would lead to a refined and more efficient design. The absence of alien visitors would therefore require a different explanation because Project Daedalus demonstrated that with current, and near future, technology, interstellar travel is feasible. Therefore, another solution to the absence of extra-terrestrial visitation was necessary.There were three stated goals for Project Daedalus:The two-stage engine configuration was powered by inertial confinement fusion using deuterium and helium-3 pellets. Electron beam diodes positioned around the base of the engine exhaust would impinge on the pellets and ignite them to produce large energy gain, at a rate of 250 detonations per second. This would continue for a boost phase lasting over 3.8 years followed by a cruise phase lasting 46 years and travelling at over 12% of the speed of light until the 450 tons science probe would finally reach its destination of the Barnard’s Star system 5.9 light years away, which it would transit in a matter of days due to its flyby nature.Also Orion could work.The “nuclear pollution” from this would be small set next to existing atomic bomb testing pollution.Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) - WikipediaAn atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 9%–11% of the speed of light.You have a bomb magazine and after each detonation of a bomb under the pusher plate, another bomb is fired using a cannon through the shown hole in the pusher plate in the figure.One pusher plate. Steam or pneumatic cylinders acting as shock absorbers between the pusher plate & main hull.The bomb detonates at a predetermined distance behind the pusher plate and timed so the pusher plate is at or near full extension of the shock absorbers. The bomb detonation pushes the plate forward and the shock absorbers change a sudden violent impulse to a much smoother acceleration with the level of acceleration not exactly constant, but generally if done right does not exceed safe accelerations for human bodies and no negative acceleration felt by the crew.Nor were “standard” nuclear weapons used.The shape of the bomb's reaction mass is critical to efficiency. The original project designed bombs with a reaction mass made of tungsten (A bomb with a cylinder of reaction mass expands into a flat, disk-shaped wave of plasma when it explodes. A bomb with a disk-shaped reaction mass expands into a far more efficient cigar-shaped wave of plasma debris.The cigar shape focuses much of the plasma to impinge onto the pusher-plate.The bomb would detonate a preset distance below the pusher plate well centered with the propellent end pointed at the pusher plate. That is tungsten or some similar very dense metal as opaque as possible to X-rays and gamma rays. That turns the nuclear explosion into practical thrust by bouncing the tungsten plasma off the pusher plate.This is a sophisticated well-developed designTest footage of the concept built into models with chemical explosive charges to show how it would work.",2 followers,Richard Muller,5K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about

This is about five orders of magnitude less effecient than the absolute minimum we’d need to have any hope of reaching any significant portion of c.Fortunately, there are alternatives.In order to get to 1% of light speed we need a more effecient method of harvesting energy.

It takes a lot more energy to fly than to walk because the air “gives” a lot more than dirt does and that “give” is an action that doesn’t generate the desired reaction- compare walking on loose sand. Still, it provides sufficient survival advantage that flight evolved.But in space there’s literally nothing dense enough to be worth even trying to push against, not even the relatively thick interplanetary medium (basically the Solar Wind,Rockets have to carry their own mass to push against, and once pushed, that “reaction mass” is left behind, and it can’t be re-used.Rockets come in different types- straight-up chemical combustion rockets that use solid or liquid fuels, ion rockets, drawing-board plasma rockets (like VASIMR) and nuclear rockets… all of them can be rated efficiency-wise by something calledThere are some caveats- for instance ion engines have a relatively low fuel consumption rate so they have good efficiency there, but they derive the energy to push the propellant away from an onboard power supply, where chemical engines derive the power from the fuel itself.Rocket scientists have tried all sorts of combinations of chemical fuels. All of them have associated hazards- they are after all energy-storage media, and the more energy they store the more hazardous they are if something goes wrong. The most common high-thrust fuel in use is liquid hydrogen combined with the oxidizer liquid oxygen, and you probably have some idea of how dangerous they both are.The chemical system with the highest efficiency ever tested is a mixture of lithium, fluorine and hydrogen, but the hazards outweigh the benefits.The rocket engine with the highest theoretical specific impulse is the so-calledA very bright fellow named Robert Bussard had the idea of designing a sort of interstellar ramjet that worked by collecting, “burning” and expelling the hydrogen gas that seems to be pretty much everywhere between the planets and the stars. That way it would have both an unlimited fuel supply and an unlimited power supply. I put “burning” in quotes because his idea is to run the hydrogen through an onboard fusion reactor, which we don’t know how to build yet. It has some issues beyond that though- when he came up with the idea the amount of available hydrogen was thought to be much higher than we now know it to be, it would collect the hydrogen with a very powerful magnetic field which would act as a scoop requiring it to be accelerated to a significant fraction of c by onboard fuel or some sort of booster before it could collect fuel, and there is some controversy whether the energy expended in collecting the hydrogen is greater than that to be gained from it (in other words it might act more as a brake than an engine).Ever since someone thought up the idea of an “There’s also the “You may have hear of the recent “We can’t get up to a significant fraction of light using rockets because the universe just doesn’t work that way.

A fission based rocket system can get over 1% light speed, and a fusion based rocket system can get to 10% light speed.A fission rocket engine is actually not that hard to build with modern technology. We had plans drawn up in the 1960s. The main hurdles aren’t technological but rather that it costs a huge amount and would significantly damage the surrounding environment, since launching one is equivalent to detonating a whole bunch of nukes on the launchpad.If there was some reason that we HAD to get a big spacecraft off the Earth going at that kind of speed, a reason so urgent or important that we didn’t mind basically nuking Houston as a cost, we could probably get such a thing up and running in 10–20 years, maybe less, if we were really desperate and really focused on the task.The alternative is to not use a rocket at all. A laser-sail spacecraft for example can be accelerated all the way to 50% light speed.","57,706 followers",Jack Fraser-Govil,37.5K,2.6K,42.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about

Thing is that Solar is around 18%-21% efficient with the commonly used domestic solar panels. The conversion from DC from the panels to AC is about 96% efficient. Making the total efficiency around 20% with good panels.So how anyone can suggest that 18% is inefficient but 1.8% is efficient is really beyond belief!Pro nuclear people like to bleat on about physics - yet they commit these lies of science constantly!The best, cheapest, fastest to build, lowest impact solutions for power generation are Solar PV & Wind. They also need storage to even out the differences between the availability of the energy inputs and the time the power is required.Even with the cost of the storage to make them useable at all times they are still the cheapest and lowest impact.Not only that but there are significant advantages to generating power as close to the point of use as possible, such as on the roof of your house, on the roof of the shopping mall, and on the roof of the factory.There are also significant relatability and cost advantages to having storage in the places where the power is required.Now unless you want to put nuclear reactors in every street then you are increasing inefficiency and cost and adding to the potential points of failure by using Nuclear over renewables.Also there is the question of energy budgets and global warming - which is going to be more and more of a problem with thermal power generation!Power paradox: Clean might not be green forever","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,2.7K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-see-as-a-unexpected-technological-advancement-that-no-one-is-talking-about
