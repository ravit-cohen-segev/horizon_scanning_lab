NASA was given very little time to develop the necessary technology, after all, and direct ascent would not require the development of docking and orbital rendezvous capabilities that were seen as complex, difficult to create and introducing points of vulnerability for the entire mission (read: “What if something fails in one of these systems around the Moon?”)In a direct ascent mission profile, a spacecraft is launched from Earth as one unit, transfers to lunar orbit, descends to the surface and launches back - all without a single docking or rendezvous stage.Unfortunately, once the initial studies were complete, a teeny tiny problem was revealed……namely, that the starship would beWhelp. It turned out that developing the rocket necessary to lift that thing would probably eclipse the effort required to perfect orbital rendezvous, guidance and all. Because sometimes, it’s the huge “big ticket” machine that’s way more difficult to create than the cutting-edge whiz-bang electronic system.The two remaining options: Earth Orbit Rendezvous (ie. “build the huge thing in orbit in a few launches”) and Lunar Orbital Rendezvous (“use a smaller lander instead of one huge space ship”) had their own pros and cons, but ultimately LOR was chosen over EOR. There were two primary reasons: one, it saved…orbital rendezvous turned out to be simpler than anticipated.But why, you might ask? Doesn’t it require sophisticated calculations? Isn’t it like hitting a bullet with another bullet?Kind of. But here’s the thing: both bullets are moving along ballistic trajectories. There is no air resistance that slows down either bullet. More importantly, the bullets can beIn order to meet a spacecraft in orbit, you need to know, essentially, three things:If you haven’t noticed yet, here’s why it turned out to be easier than anticipated: all three of these things can be either pre-calculated (the ascent profile) or calculated on site, using nothing else but relative positions and speeds of the target and the ascending spacecraft!And holy hell, it actually gets better!First, the fact you only need relative positions means that *both* the target and the ascending ship can gather the necessary data, giving the scheme redundancy. And, since both ‘bullets’ are moving at a steady trajectory around the Moon, it means that should an error be made in the calculations, it is not fatal: the ascending lunar lander is not going to crash back into the Moon if it misses the command module. So, as long as the lander gets into an orbit, there will be room to fix errors.To that effect, NASA had to develop:The final part is super important. NASA did successfully develop sophisticated guidance systems for Apollo. NASA did develop great inertial navigation systems. NASA purchased and installed state-of-the-art mainframes for ground support, too. Apollo also enjoyed its legacy as a direct ascent spacecraft in the fact that the Service Module’s engine was super beefy.But, shit happens, right? What if all of the above failed?Fear not: with the right mission planning, the risks could be minimized.Two things present the biggest risks during a lunar orbital rendezvous mission: navigational system failure on the surface, that prevents acquisition of data necessary for launch, and a failure in orbit that prevents the computer from calculating the maneuvers (length and times of engine burns) to close and dock.The first problem was solved byApollo 11 landed right near the lunar equator (the site was only 0.67 degrees north). Why is that important, you ask?It meant that, should all electronics fail and the slide rule broke somehow, the crew only had to fly a pre-calculated ascent profile (which they memorized) and get the LM intoRemember what I wrote about orbital planes? Launching from any other latitude requires calculating an azimuth in order to achieve a specific plane, and you simply cannot get your plane to zero degrees, either. If the command module was in the wrong place (because it was an emergency launch), then it might not have the fuel necessary to adjust its own plane and intercept the lander.But when launching from the equator? No azimuth required. You just keep going in the same direction you were going when landing (also from an equatorial plane) and your orbit will be more or less aligned no matter when you launched.Then the CSM acquires you with its own radar and does the interception using its own engine.The second problem was pre-empted by goodEnter Buzz Aldrin. A lot of people aren’t sure why he’s sometimes called “Dr.” Aldrin, so let me explain: he’s called that because he’s a PhD, and the title of his thesis is…“Line-of-sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous”Buzz Aldrin, who you might recall was selected as the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 11, was, at the time, the world’s leading expert in navigational problems relating to orbital rendezvous. He could, quite literally, perform all of the required calculations by hand, using a sliderule. He’d still need some data, but those could be fed from either spacecraft (two radars = redundancy!) or even, with some effort, from the ground.RedundancyEven the crew itself was an additional backup to all the backups. A multi-modal failure that simultaneously knocked out all of the redundant systems was not very likely.So, to summarize:",0 followers,Paweł Żuk,883,567,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles
1,"Essentially, the question is asking: did the lunar orbital rendezvous require a sophisticated guidance system?Yes, and no.YesNoEssentially, the question is asking: did the lunar orbital rendezvous require a sophisticated guidance system?Yes, and no.YesNoThose conditions are:With that, the process is relatively simple, and relatively efficient (though never quite as efficient as calculating your exact trajectory in advance):If you do this, you can make orbital rendezvous without needing to make too many (or even any) calculations and without wasting fuel. You just need a reliable restartable rocket engine and a bit of time.If you are in a rush, you can brute force it (accelerating towards the target, then accelerating up or down to maintain altitude) but you will waste a ton of fuel. That ruled out the brute force approach for Apollo.Still, the Apollo missions would have had to make more precise calculations in advance since their ascent stage engine was only quaified for 15 restarts and was fixed thrust. Without making precise calculations, eyeballing would have needed a lot of experience doing the manoeuvre, which the Apollo astronauts did not have. With precise calculations, there would be little to no fuel wasted and it would only need a minimum of 4 engine restarts (ascent, lower orbit circularisation, transfer to target orbit, target orbit circularisation).",9 followers,Jerry Stone,1.1K,395,646.6K,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

On-board radar units provided very accurate measurements of the relative positions and velocities LM (Lunar Module) and CSM (Command and Service Module stack). All of these devices were state of the art for the day, and very expensive, but that wasn’t a big problem for the Apollo program.To put the computational requirements in perspective, you can simulate the missions, complete with nice graphics [1], using a Raspberry Pi 3. [2] The Raspberry Pi actually uses more capacity for the graphics than the astrodynamics, and still spends most of its time waiting. The astronomy and astrodynamics libraries use models developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, quite similar to the ones used for actual interplanetary missions.[1] The graphics wouldn’t be to modern video game standards, but better than what you’d have seen on arcade-style games from the late 1980s.[2] Some years ago, I used a Raspberry Pi 3 to implement an interplanetary flight simulator. I might have been able to use a Raspberry Pi 2, but I needed more memory for the graphics programming.","3,592 followers",Mark Shulmann,548,2.2K,34.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

So it was left behind, and the Ascent Stage, with its own engine and fuel tanks provided the lift back into space.Incidentally, some people have asked how they managed to take off from the Moon as they only had a few seconds of fuel left when they landed. I hope the answer to that is now obvious.The Ascent Stage engine had a thrust of 3,500 lbf and had 5,187 lb of fuel.This photo from Apollo 17 shows the Ascent Stage shortly before docking with the Command Module.

Great question.Since we’re focused here on the liftoff from the lunar surface, when I refer to the LM (Lunar Module), we’re really talking about just the ascent stage, since that’s the only portion of the LM that lifted off from the surface:While the LM’s ascent engine couldn’t be throttled, there were still a lot of variables that the computer could manage. By adjusting the attitude of the LM ascent module, the computer could control how much of the thrust went toward increasing the LM’s altitude and how much went into forward velocity. While the mission planners could calculate how long they thought the ascent burn should take, the computer actually watched the acceleration of the ascent module, adjusting the attitude in real time and shutting off the engine when the desired altitude and velocity had been reached.Above: LM Inertial Measuring Unit, which included the accelerometers which enabled the computer to precisely measure changes to the LM’s velocity in all three axes.More importantly, the orbit that resulted from lunar ascent didn’t have to be exact — it just had to be close. The crucial thing to understand is that the lunar liftoff and ascent wasn’t all of it — there were many more engine burns yet to be done. The mission planners knew that the initial orbit wouldn’t be exactly what they’d planned, and the subsequent burns enabled them to adjust any errors.On Apollo 11, here’s the complete list of maneuvers that got the LM off the lunar surface and allowed it to rendezvous with the Command Module (times are in hours:minutes mission-elapsed time):The last burn brought the two spacecraft within yards of each other, and around 128:03 the two spacecraft were docked. On Apollo 11 the time from liftoff until docking was about 3 hours 41 minutes, which was a bit shy of two lunar orbits.On Apollo 11 and 12, the initial burn — liftoff and orbit insertion — used the 3500-lb-thrust ascent engine. All the remaining burns were small adjustments to the orbit, and used the four RCS thruster sets.The computer managed all of these burns. In each case the engine/thrusters were shut off when the desired orbital change had actually been achieved, so even if the ascent engine or thrusters produced a bit more or less thrust than expected, the computer could adjust the burn time accordingly and get exactly the velocity change it needed.As the Apollo program progressed, mission planners got better and better at getting the two spacecraft back together. For one thing, on later missions the Apollo CSM met the LM halfway — the CSM dropped down from its usual 60 nm orbit to a far lower orbit before lunar liftoff, so that the LM didn’t have to climb into such a high orbit. Here’s the sequence of events for Apollo 17 LM’s ascent:And by 187:37, the two spacecraft were docked. They managed this in just over a single lunar orbit, with far fewer maneuvers. Again, the LM computer managed all of these burns.So TL;DR: The initial ascent only had to be close, but not perfect — the additional burns adjusted the orbit in various ways based on real-time information about the positions and velocities of both spacecraft, ultimately bringing the two spacecraft together.","3,592 followers",Mark Shulmann,931,2.2K,34.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

15,"Your question seems to be based on the notion that the LM ascent stage engine needed something to ‘regulate its power’.

As long as the thrust characteristics of the engine were known (in this case, fixed thrust) steering the LM to the required orbit was not a complex task. Rocket vehicles launched from the earth (also with fixed thrust engines) had been doing the same job for over 10 years at the time of the Apollo 11 mission.In summary, it didn’t matter that the ascent engine had ‘nothing to regulate its power’. That wasn’t what was needed. What was needed was a GNC system of sufficient capability, and the LM had one.Thank you very much.","3,592 followers",Mark Shulmann,1K,2.2K,34.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

The term ‘Science Fiction’ itself has a nebulous definition.But from my perspective, great Sci-fi is all about the idea – something that provokes a sense of wonder and fosters dialogue, both within and with others.Therefore, a great Sci-Fi story can take place either on the Starship Swift in the Gaga Nebula, 1250 years into the future where our heroes battle against the incursion of the Kanye System.Or it can transpire in a little cabin on Earth where a group of university professors attempt to contend with a sensational revelation.That second scenario is the premise of my pick –Here’s a brief logline:The plot focuses on John Oldman, a departing university professor, who claims to be a Cr0-Magnon (or Magdalenian caveman) who has secretly survived for more than 14,000 years. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.And that’s the whole movie, in a nutshell. A farewell party turned to something infinitely more interesting after Oldman makes an audacious claim – that he’s been walking on this planet for 14,000 years.What follows is an 89-minute examination of that claim.You see, Oldman’s friends are accomplished University professors, each of them specialising in subjects such as Biology, Art History, Anthropology, History and Archaeology.They will not take Oldman’s lofty claim lying downAnd so, we are treated to a game of intellectual and philosophical tête-à-tête.Although his colleagues are rightly disbelieving at first, with every passing minute, Oldman’s claims grow bolder and more incendiary.The entire movie is centred on their conversation, and it is utterly enthralling. The ideas are ambitious, and the dialogue crackles.I will confess that the standard of acting is dubious at certain points and the production values are appalling at times, but it doesn’t hinder the experience.Ultimately,No matter how many millions producers throw at a movie, unless the writing is substantial, it will feel hollow.And it is in this aspect thatJerome Bixby, the writer, initially conceived this story in the 1960s and only completed it on his deathbed in 1998. All that time and effort spent is palpable in the completed product.Made on a mere $200,000 budget,It might have been made on a low budget, but its themes and ideas are grand and profound.And to me, that’s what counts.","15,664 followers",Sarthak Raj Baral,7.4K,549,65.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

Although sci-fi is normally associated with just about anything to do with space or the future such as the action movie, Independence Day, and the space-western, Star Wars, at its heart, good science fiction should be about the human condition.

Although sci-fi is normally associated with just about anything to do with space or the future such as the action movie, Independence Day, and the space-western, Star Wars, at its heart, good science fiction should be about the human condition. Out of all the films that have been released in the past few years, one film perfectly fits this bill-ArrivalThe basic premise of the film is that one day twelve alien ships appear at separate, seemingly random, locations around the world. Nobody knows why they are here or even how to communicate with them. As a result, Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguistics professor and physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner), are hired by the US Government to find the answer to the question, “What is your purpose on earth?” and thus discern whether or not they are a threat to humanity’s survival. Whilst their team frantically work towards learning the alien language and how to communicate with them, the alien’s presence causes tensions to mount. Before long, everything they’ve worked towards is put into jeopardy as global war looms.Although being ostensibly hard sci-fi and exploring high concept ideas on the nature of time, free-will, language and communication, Arrival still manages to be rooted in a human and emotional story. Part of its success in this perfect marriage was in its protagonist, Dr. Louise Banks, and her brilliant portrayal by Amy Adams (which certainly deserved at the very least an academy award nomination). First beginning with flashbacks from Louise’s past and the death of her daughter at a young age that leaves Louise apathetic to life, Amy Adams delivers a melancholic and subtle performance, layered with emotion as her character begins to achieve a sense of agency as the film progresses.Through the film’s premise of an alien encounter, Arrival looks at how we would deal with the possibility of such an event (the rather cynical, yet unsurprising conclusion offered is one of chaos, ignorance, collapse in trust and paranoia). In doing so, the film puts a mirror up to society, to teach ideas of communication and trust, ideas especially relevant in the current political climate (the film was released three days following the US election). By having our human protagonists study aliens and their non-linear language, we begin to study humanity through our differences to the aliens. The various world governments fear the aliens and the potential for any malign intentions not due to any evidence, but because of what they know about human history. However despite its critical commentary of our society, Arrival offers a message of hope, a message on living life.Despite its thoughtful nature, the film is far from a slow, artsy film, offering moments of tensions and drama through the film that prevent the film from ever being boring if you weren’t already invested in it. Its brilliant direction from Denis Villeneuve and screenplay (adapted from Ted Chiang’s “Story of your Life” by Eric Heisserer) is complemented by excellent cinematography and a score by Johan Johansson that goes from hauntingly beautiful to eerie and anxiety inducing.Overall, Arrival was to me a brilliant antidote to the current state of the film industrial, one that was (and still is) full of blockbuster reboots and extended universes designed with the sole intention of setting up the next sequel and hence make money. However with Arrival, I was presented with a well-crafted, thought provoking, ambitious film.

I’ll leave it at that really. This is a criminally underrated film.Sunshine-2007-Sci-FiDanny Boyle an English movie director, and has given us movies like 28 days later, train spotting, Slumdog Millionaire, and 127 hours, gives us his first true Sci-Fi movie, and trust me man, it’s a banger. It’s basically about how our Sun is dying, and as a last ditch effort to save our Sun, a group of astronauts go on a mission to save it. During the mission though, things take a dark turn man, and we’ll, this movie was a true underrated gem.Europa Report-2013-Sci-FiWith a budget of less than 10 million bucks, what the movie makers pulled out with this one kinda blew me away. The only thing that this movie suffers from is the pacing as it can be a little slow, but if you stick with it, then ending makes it all worth it. Basically a team of astronauts go on a mission to confirm if there’s life on Jupiter’s moon Europa. Again, the crew runs into some problems as well. To me this is another underrated movie that flew under the radar. Lastly,Event Horizon-1997-Sci-Fi/HorrorThis one is an oldie but a goody. A space crew while on their mission discovers a lost spacecraft that mysteriously reappears. What takes place next after is literally out of this world. This one is a little more darker, and scarier in nature, but the sci-fi components are still front and centre.Another Earth (2011)-Sci-Fi/DramaThis one was really surprising. It’s about a young woman that has a lot going for her. A cosmic event happens across the world and she faces a tragedy. A duplicate earth appears across our earth, and even though this movie had a fairly low budget, it has some exceptional ideas, and to me was quite original.Predestination (2014)-Sci-FiStaring Ethan Hawke, this movie is about time travel. The story is quite original and it flew under the radar in my opinion. There is a plot twist near the end of the movie that left me fucking speechless man. For a Sci-Fi film, you don’t get much better than this one.Robot & Frank (2012)-Sci-Fi/DramaThis one made me laugh, and sadly, cry too. It’s a story about an ex cat burglar who’s starting to get Alzheimer’s. His family sets him up with a modern robot to care for him. The story in this film is exceptional and has a few twists and turns. Sadly, this movie flew well under the radar man. In my opinion this movie gets a hard 9/10.The Endless (2017)-Sci-FiThis is a sci-fi movie that that almost comes across as a horror film. It’s about a group of guys while on a road trip come across a cult. What takes place next is not only mind bending but had me reading through Reddit forums to make sense of some of the story. It’s not overly complicated or anything like that, but there were a few what the fuck moments that left me a little bewildered. This is a sold watch, and again, flew under many peoples radars.Snowpiercer (2013)-Sci-FiStarring Chris Evans (Captain America) the movie, not the new series on Netflix. The movie takes place in the future where because of a catastrophe theres a train constantly running around the world 24/7 keeping the last of earths population alive, like a moving Ark. It’s violent, bloody, and the ending man…Geez. The film has a heavy South Korean influence and was directed by Bong Joon-ho. Think of it as the South Koreans scoring a big named Hollywood actor for their Sci-Fi film. This movie is very close to the book. A true gem of a film, and a much different pace than the new series.Moon (2009)-Sci-FiOkay okay, I know, I have to stop man because I can literally go on forever. You want to see an underrated Sci-Fi film? Watch this one. I can’t get into it as much as I’d like to without spoiling the movie, but let’s just say it takes place in the future, and an astronaut is counting down the days until he can return back to earth from mining minerals on our moon. Weird things over time start to happen. He can never reach his family, weird health problems, and an AI companion talking to him. Seriously man, if you haven’t seen this movie you’re missing out.Project Almanac (2015)-Sci-FiIt’s strange no one ever talks about this one. It’s about 6 years old, but man, if there was ever a movie that could teach someone on how not to mess with time travel, this is the one. I suppose it’s for the younger crowd in nature, but it still has a fairly mature theme too it, and guess what? I LOVED this film. To me it doesn’t get more criminally underrated than this one. Solid 9/10 from me. High school kids finding a time travel device? What could go wrong right?!Automata- 2015- Sci-fiThis movie was in theatres and it did modestly well. It totally has Blade Runner vibes, and nobody really talks about it any more. It has Antonio Banderas, Melanie Griffith, and Dylan McDermott (American Horror Story). In the future robots interact with humans, but AI could become an issue, I won’t say more because it will spoil it. Pretty solid film.Looper- 2012-Sci-fiStarting Bruce Willis Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Emily Blunt. It takes place in the future or past depending on how you look at it. Time travel? Telekinesis?

My nomination is not a movie, but a tv-show. Funnily enough it’s on Syfy, which usually sucks, but I think it was made in conjunction with Netflix and is based on a book series so I they were pressured to put effort into it. It’s “The Expanse”Pictures from GoogleThis would have to be one of the most scientifically accurate tv shows/movies I’ve seen set in the distant future.Without giving too much away it’s basically set in the future, humanity has colonized most of the Solar System, but there’s a Cold War between 3 major factions:The United Nations of Earth- Basically your typical dystopian future bureaucratic oligarchy trying to impose it’s will on all the human colonies by exploiting it's effective monopoly on breathable air. People on Earth live in luxury, going to schmoozing dinner parties and complaining about grasping colonials trying to take more than they deserve.Mars- A military dictatorship that is antagonistic towards Earth, edging for total independence. Mars is the largest off-world colony. Because of its large population and limited resources it has developed a highly authoritarian, Spartan-like system of government where resources are strictly rationed. Martians view Earthlings as weak and decadent and resent Earth's monopoly on breathable air.Belters- People who inhabit asteroids and dwarf planets in the outer regions of the Solar System. Mutated by life spent in low gravity, too weak to survive on Earth. They have extremely poor living conditions as they have to work to collect ice to produce water, as well as metal ore, which they can then trade for air from Earth. Air and water are the most valuable commodities in this region of space. There’s a quasi-religious, low level insurgency agitating for independence from both Earth and Mars.A Belter being subjected to Earth gravityThere are some other interesting factions in the show, like the Mormons, who have become a major religion and are building a massive colony ship to go and colonize Kolob, from the Mormon bible. There are also various gangs, police, spies etc.The story is about a bunch of characters investigating a series of murders, terrorist attacks and conspiracies in what seems to be an attempt to instigate a war between the major factions of the Solar System.Why I think it’s a good “hard” sci-fi show is basically because it does physics really well, like to the point where most people wouldn’t even realize how realistic it is. For example there’s no faster-than-light-travel, people zip around the solar system at high speed in ships with very limited fuel supplies, to the point where fuel plays a large part in the story, unlike most sci-fis. Also, the show does have “artificial gravity” but it’s not artificial gravity like most sci-fi has where someone flips a switch and, hey presto, Earth like gravity. The show has a few ways of explaining artificial gravity;The first is just low gravity. On the dwarf planets like Ceres people just live in micro-gravity. For the most part things behave as they do on Earth, probably for budgetary reasons, but every now and then it will show a bird flying by flapping it’s wings really slowly or someone will throw something and it takes a long time to fall. Like I said it doesn’t apply to everything, but it’s a nice little nod to realism.Then there’s magnetic boots and harnesses. Again, this one isn’t entirely accurate, people walk onto a ship, turn on their magnetic boots or put on their harnesses and then suddenly everything like hair or liquid behaves as it would on Earth, but like I said that’s probably budgetary reasons.They also use spinning rings to generate gravity, but unlike most sci-fis where they use a ring that’s only a few yards across that manages to generate perfect Earth-like gravity, the ring stations in the show are huge. Like the Nauvoo, the Mormon colony ship being built for a great pilgrimage. Ring ships would need to be at least this big in order to avoid having the gravity at your head substantially lower than the gravity at your feet.It's hard to gauge how big the ship is in this picture but it's HUGE. It's construction is an enormous project requiring years to build and enormous investment by the Mormon Church to complete.But my favourite form of artificial gravity is one I don’t think I’ve ever seen in a sci-fi movie or tv show and is used mainly for the really big ships. Instead of the ships being designed like Earth ocean going ships, that is with the decks running lengthwise, the ships are designed kind of like skyscrapers with engines on the bottom. The ships maintain a constant acceleration of 1G which has the effect of generating perfect Earth-like gravity. The show even includes the process of ships having to take a long time to slow down again before reaching their destinations. This is only used when the ships are travelling long distances between planets and asteroids, and also conveniently explains how they managed to cross distances in a few days that would take our current technology months or years to cross. I’m sure engineers and experts in orbital mechanics could pick it apart, but still, it’s a commendable feature for a sci-fi tv show. Here’s a cross-section of a ship to show what I mean:And like I said, while the gravity isn’t 100% because of budget reasons they still include a massive number of special-effects shots in low and zero gravity which are really good to watch.In general the ship design and locomotion is realistic. Ships don’t bank like aircraft traveling in atmosphere, they maneuver and adjust attitude with the use of thrusters, like real space ships.Also, weapons are fairly realistic too. Personal firearms are projectile weapons rather than blasters or lasers, anti-ship torpedoes also operate differently than in most sci-fi, it’s hard to explain but it’s great. There’s a really excellent scene between a massive warship and a bunch of smaller attackers which is top notch. It also mostly get the sounds right. So space shots are generally quiet, or very muffled (guess they have to make some aesthetic compromises). It usually cuts to inside ships for explosions, where there would be sound.All in all, I’d say The Expanse is one of only a few sci-fi in either cinema or tv which comes anywhere near qualifying as hard sci-fi. Unlike shows like Star Wars or Star Trek where travelling in space is just like catching a train, space travel in The Expanse always feels risky, expensive, complicated and limited, just like real life.

In the movie there is a corporation that has perfected the technique for mining this helium and sending it back to Earth as an energy source. However, in order to make the operation profitable they only send a single operator to the moon for a three year contract before they are replaced by the next miner. The story begins with Sam Bell nearing the end of his three year rotation and he’s going a bit stir crazy by himself with only intermittent messages from his employer and family and the lunar station robot to keep him company. Without getting into spoilers there is an accident which causes some serious issues with the three year schedule.

A country where the women are prayed became the blood stained graveyard of a young woman.1987 was a year when print media was more pronounced than the electronic media. The news regarding her immolation grabbed the headlines 13 days later on September 17,1987. An event called as Chunri Mahotsava was held to celebrate 13 days of her death.The print media then drew its attention to this horrific incident and it strongly criticized an abolished archaic practise already made illegal 150 years ago.This inhumane act became a topic of nationwide debate and it brought the plight of widows before the nation.The media described how a black sheet was put around a widow in Rajasthan so that no men or married women can see her. She must sit on the floor all day, her knees drawn close to her chest, in a dark cubicle.

But very few persons know  that there is a big difference between Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian who traveled in to space and Kalpana who explored the space. Rakesh Sharma was just an international passenger without any responsibility on Soviet space flight. Whereas Kalpana was selected by NASA as an astronaut on the basis of her strong academic career and experience and she had to perform crucial duties on board. In her both visits to space she was roped in with the responsibilities of handling of the space shuttle and experimenting in space.She has been a role model to several women in terms of  achievement and contributions to the field of aeronautics. Growing up in  a male dominant society, Kalpana never let her dreams of flying be  affected in any way. In fact she was the first woman to study  aeronautical engineering in her batch.Achievements and AccoladesDespite living in America, Kalpana Chawla was considered the pride of  India. She was the first Indian woman to travel in a space shuttle for  372 hours and complete 252 rotations around the Earth's atmosphere. Her  achievements have been an inspiration to many others in India and  abroad. There are many science institutions named after her.During her lifetime, Kalpana Chawla was awarded with three awards namely  the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, NASA Space Flight Medal and the  NASA Distinguished Service Medal.Some Facts about Dr. Kalpana ChawlaFirst and only Indian-American in space (she was born in India and became a naturalized U.S. citizen)MEMORIAOn February 5, 2003, India's Prime Minister announced that the  meteorological series of satellites, ""METSAT"", will be renamed as  ""KALPANA"". The first satellite of the series, ""METSAT-1"", launched by  India on September 12, 2002 will be now known as ""KALPANA-1"".Generally people die unsung and are forgotten even before their last rites are over. There are a few lucky ones like Kalpana Chawla who live in everyone’s heart forever. Well, to give tribute to the daughter of India various news stories are still flooding in media, awards and trophies in her name are being introduced at various level of education and space research activities, one satellite is being named after her. But the real tribute to Kalpana Chawla will be to provide more and more knowledge and information to ignite the hunger for the achievement, virtue and capabilities that she had and to struggle with the hardship as she faced, to the future generation.

But the saddest part is, that our very own youth is not aware about this.In recent Hollywood movie of Churchill,Bengal Famine was one of the hundreds of man-made famines committed by the Britishers in India.

It was a war which involved nearly the entire world and left a death toll of over 66 million. The sacrifice of soldiers, and civilians who fought against fascism can never fully be appreciated even today. In far too many cases they gave everything they had including their lives so that future generations could live in societies which were free of fascism. brutality, racial oppression. Yet, one of the largest forces to fight against the Axis is hardly remembered, it was India. At the peak of World War II, India had 2.5 million men in arms fighting the Axis Powers. Nearly 6 million, Indian Civilians perished as a result of the World War II. The Bengal Famine was the end result of intentional British Policy directed in India. Winston Churchill would refuse to allow food assistance and continued to export food from India for the war effort. Eastern India would see its fishing boats burnt and largescale manipulation of food prices. Winston Churchill called this an action to “Starve” the Indian Freedom Fighters. In North Africa, Europe and Asia, India would lose 90,000 soldiers and hundreds of thousands would return home with lifelong injuries. These men were not taken care of or provided for like their counterparts in other parts of the Empire. Instead, they would be forgotten. India’s incredible financial contribution and supply of manufactured as well raw materials were never shown to be critical factors in the allied victory. The fact that India emerged in 1945 as the fourth largest industrial power in the world was a fact concealed desperately by the British Empire which hardly could govern India let alone lead it to prosperity which it had long ago stolen from it.Female Indian Army Personnel, 1939–1945Indians did not just fight as combat soldiers in World War II. There were pilots, navy men, doctors, nurses and a considerable portion of India’s population toiled more than 12 hours a day producing armaments, steel, and other materials for the war effort. India contributed more to the war effort than nations which are named routinely for their efforts in winning over fascism. Many Indians were recruited by force to join the army, others were pressed to shift production in their companies to support the war effort without choice such as my Great Grand Father Baba Shib Dayal Bedi. Princely states were forced to provide land and capital to support industrial output, along with Indian Industrialists who also dedicated production to the war effort.40% of all clothing made in India went to war production during World War II.All told, India factors in the upper portion of the list of nations which contributed to the Allied Victory in World War II. The fact that many Indians such as Subhas Chandra Bose attempted to use the war to bring freedom to India, does not in any way change the fact of India’s contribution. The fact that India was partitioned by the British Empire for its own geopolitical interests, and Pakistan was created as a result took away from the recognition that United India had given. In great measure more than 66% of that India geographically survives as India today. When Independence came, the shear chaos of partition would create an atmosphere where the idea of analyzing India’s role of World War II would not be a priority in comparison to ensuring the survival of a bankrupt India which had been handed back to Indians after 190 years of colonial rule.Japanese Posters at the time pushed Indians to rise against the British Empire. It was stated “Show the Devil a stick and save India.”Only three weeks of currency reserves were at hand for a nation of 350 million people, food shortages became rampant after the partition of Pakistan, and the struggle would be to feed this population somehow for the first three decades of Independence. When food production finally climbed to self-s...",5 followers,Sean Wang,2.6K,350,11.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

In addition, corgis enjoy being neat and tidy with light body flavor; so they are loved by people! Corgis are able to live in a variety of different environments. They can adapt to life in a house, on a farm, and even in small apartments. As long as they get the required amount of daily exercise, they will be happy in any home.

So when I go to bed at night I have to move a large rawhide bone (that he's been chewing on for the last 5 years), a red rubber duck with devil horns, an old green tennis ball and a dead bird (we just call it 'dead bird' cause it looks like one).Anyway, not sure why other people like dogs so much because I sure don't.UPDATE 1Not sure why, I guess she must have cast some kind of spell on me, but I bought her and took her home.And now this new dog who we have named Bianca insists on watching movies with me but always falls asleep (except during the parts where there are other dogs on the screen) and then I have to explain the plot to her when she wakes up.She has also tricked our other dog into falling in love with her so now they gang up on me as a team. It might be kind of hard to tell but in the photo below Bianca is getting ready to attack me.But most of the time Bianca just looks like this.UPDATE 2:Thanks for all the upvotes.
