Technologically, companies will continue to develop clean forms of energy despite the fact low oil and coal price. Companies such as Tesla will become new Exxon Mobile or Ford. Private citizens will act in order to support companies to develop clean energy through crowdfunding which will be one perhaps the most used form of finance.These efforts will be directed to India whereaprox. 300 million people will move from rural areas to urban, Brazil, South Africa, the United States, Russia (or what will be there after Russia), China (a lot of small regions, not today’s China).The idea is that in the next 10 years people and companies will act with visionary politicians such as Modi, Peña Nieto, Macron, Trudeau to promote clean energy around the globe.Geopolitics:Russia will collapse in the same way the Soviet Union collapsed. USSR collapsed when their defense budget was highly increased and when oil price was low. Now, in 2017 we have exact the same conditions. After all, Vladimir Putin is in charge since 2000. The last generation doesn’t know another political leader than Putin. They will act in the same way Egyptian people acted in 2011. Yes, there will be a Russian Spring, not in 10 years but in less than 3. In 10 years there will be a lot of small states.China will implode in a less centralized government. The gap between regions and rich-poor people is too high to be ignored. Chinese regions will act independently according to their economic interests.Japan may solve its demographic crisis using robots for manufacturing. Immigrants will not invade Japan in the next 10 years. Japan will reconquer its lost territories from Russia and will dominate China once again.With a low oil price, Saudi Arabia will no longer exist as a state. They currently implemented Strategy 2030, a national strategy to diversify Saudi economy. But because of its religious influence and social structure, it is too late to act. A good example in diversifying an oil based economy is the United Arab Emirates that will become a financial hub, an educational world center and perhaps a technological power.South America will grow if it will remain stable. This region will develop tremendously. With a lack of external threats and lack of internal rivalry, those countries will form an effective economic bloc. The new generation of politicians will fight against corruption and organized crime. In the next 10–30 years we will talk about “The Mexican Model” which will be exported to Central and South America. Current Mexican president is a reformist who is fighting to stabilize the country and eliminate drug cartels. Mexico has an enormous potential to develop due to its ocean coastlines, natural resources, and workforce.The United States has to turn back being the world leader. Trump’s approach on international relation is very similar to China foreign policy: bilateral negotiations, zero-sum game, isolationism. I expect only 4 years of Trump, then I expect a left-wing president such as Bernie Sanders. The reason is young people are involved in the social debate and they are willing to promote the values such as universal free education and healthcare, equality of chances. In the same way, the future generation of European will act to establish a fiscal union, in the US next generation will act to introduce free access to education and healthcare. Due to the technological and financial development, we could expect a success.African continent will transform itself dramatically. Countries such as Nigeria will become the new china while Chinese provinces will develop themselves in the same way Japan did. Africa is very unpredictable because of its lack of political institutions. The political risk of investment in Africa is too high now. The only way to change this is towards political approach. African states need stable institutions, efficient governance and fair justice system.Social:Risks:"
