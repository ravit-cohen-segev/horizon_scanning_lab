You're looking at a couple of challenges. I noticed that most of the answers here involve transplanting it to a new body, which adds some problems, and I also have to note that you didn't specify what quality of life this brain needs, or whether it must communicate with the outside world.But first, some background.I'm a neuroscience PhD student; I work mostly in electrophysiology with some computational stuff mixed in. And I regularly keep disembodied slices of mammalian brain tissue alive and signalling for hours. I'll describe that process, and then I'll discuss how this technique is adapted for whole brains.To keep extracted brain tissue alive means that I need to replace the body systems that kept the brain healthy in the first place. I mix up a solution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), which is essentially Gatorade. It's got replacement electrolytes in the correct concentrations, a couple of compounds to buffer the solution and control the pH, and some nutrients for those living cells. I also mix in some antioxidants because the brain has had rather a dramatic shock and needs to be protected while the neurons heal or at least recover. I could expand on this if you'd like.Next, I start a drip which allows the ACSF to flow across or through an interface chamber where it can bathe the brain tissue, and I turn on a heater which brings the fluid up to body temperature. I also bubble oxygen into the ACSF, plus blow additional humidified oxygen across the surface of the brain slice if part of it will be above solution for electrode recording. Between the ACSF, the heat, and oxygen, the brain is now receiving what it requires for survival. And the flow rate is sufficient to carry waste away; in most of my interface chambers the ACSF is not recycled and is just suctioned into a collection flask for disposal. There are many reasons for this but chief among them are because of potential contamination with bacteria or metabolic wastes, and also because this setup allows me to deliver drugs or toxins and then let them wash away. Also, the amounts of ACSF I use are trivial, perhaps two liters on a busy day. Hardly worth reclaiming.Anyhow, this works wonderfully for a slice of brain tissue and I can keep several of them alive and active for several hours at a time. But these slices are 200 to 400 micrometers thick, so vasculature is unnecessary. What about a whole brain?Enter Dr. Marco De Curtis. He has advanced a technique for extracting a whole brain and tapping into its internal vasculature by catheterizing the Circle of Willis. This is kind of a big deal because it gives us access to intact systems; if I recall correctly, he published a paper where they kept the olfactory system attached and were able to study scent recognition. But there are a couple of problems with his approach; the biggest problem is that it does not work in the most common disease models of mice and rats. It only works in guinea pigs.In fact, I work with a different rodent than any of those and it's an apt model for certain human diseases. A month ago my ""Principal Investigator"" (PI; aka lead researcher) noted that our animals have a substantially similar vasculature to guinea pigs. He injected dye into the vessels, emailed Dr. De Curtis, and was encouraged to continue. This is an ongoing project; we've been having a lot of trouble because the vessels are so darned small. Fine Science Tools should be delivering some equipment this afternoon and we'll take another tilt at this windmill tomorrow.So, to answer your question: Sure, a whole brain can be kept alive, at least potentially and with today's technology. It's mostly a matter of developing the existing techniques, and we're still working on it.As for how long it can be kept alive - conceivably, for a normal lifespan. The challenges would be the same as with any open surgical wound. You'd need to keep it sterile, moist, and with ample circulation. Forever is not an option at this point, because biology (or medicine, which is applied biology) still has not solved senescence. In other words, the brain will still get old. It might even age faster without sensory inputs, which neatly segues into the last point:Holy hell, man, this is a disturbing question. At this time we have nearly zero means of delivering sensory stimulus to a brain; at best, if you were to keep the optic and auditory nerves intact, you'd be able to use something like cochlear implants and the current generation of very rudimentary replacement retinas. Other sensory stuff - balance, proprioception, touch, temperature - we still cannot reproduce on any level that approaches meaningful input, at least not directly to the brain. Maybe if you kept the spinal cord attached.Outputs face even more drastic problems; Utah arrays do allow for controlling a robot arm or a computer cursor. But this is very limited, even with the current state of the art. Heck, I have a couple of Utah arrays in the other room and I know how much information they can carry; it isn't much compared to the rich data usually moving through our nervous system.You'd essentially be building a quadriplegic, except without even sensory input from the face via the cranial nerves which are usually intact after a spinal injury. This would be an extremely limited existence and, at the moment, horrifying to contemplate; in my opinion, even oblivion might be preferable. Imagine total locked-in syndrome, but worse.To make this a desirable therapy will require several technologies to mature and a whole lot of science to be coordinated and engineered.There's hope, though. Progress has been promising; if I had to pull a number out of the air, I'd say check back here in two decades. In the meantime, I'll keep working on my portion of the problem."

People resort to virtual assistants rather than calling or submitting forms, which would have been quite time-consuming.Now we are almost halfway through 2019. Thus, it is time for us to analyse the tech innovations that would take the world by storm in the year 2020. I have crafted the list of top 8 tech trends that would change our lifestyle in 2020.1.Did you know that almost 49% of consumers rely on mobile phones for shopping? 61% of the consumers in the US use their mobile phones to compare prices of different products in the brick and mortar stores. Over 61 million people in the United States have been reported to be using mobile payments. Considering all these statistics, it is safe to say that mobile commerce will successfully edge into our lives by the year 2020.Most of the people use apps and mobile friendly websites for shopping on their mobile devices. The best thing about mobile payments is that you can pay for products without the requirement of in-hand cash. You can pay for the products or services through Apply Pay and Google Pay. China has already introduced WeChat and Alipay for online transactions. Even panhandlers tend to opt for this system of transactions since it has made life simpler for many.2. AI as a serviceAlexa and Siri are nothing but the amazing products of AI technology. It is needless to say that these tech innovations have made things easier for millions of people. Companies have already started to streamline their business operations and improve their customer experience through the use of AI. The thing is that designing AI-based systems requires a great deal of money for most of the businesses. Thus, 2020 will find most of the AI applications in the form of service platforms.We can find such AI-as-a-service system on the platforms of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These usually consist of an expensive custom engineering technique which lets us use these websites easily. The AI makes it possible for us to look for specific categories among the multiple products on Amazon. We can even type the name of our desired product and get access to all the similar products within a matter of seconds. By 2020, we can expect different organisations to adopt this AI-as-a-service system and provide ore tailored applications to consumers.3. AutomationAutomation has made it possible for organisations to get time-consuming and mundane tasks over with easily. Organisations have been able to maximize their productivity and increase production rates due to automation. Human effort may lead to high-end quality workmanship. But, the automated systems tend to perform the same activity with less variability. This results in consistent product quality and greater control of the product quality. The automated systems also help the organisations make the most of raw materials thereby giving rise to comparatively less scarp in 2019.We can expect the automation to take over most of the industries including banking and pharmacies. It will decrease human effort considerably along with other production costs. Thus, automation will also maximize the profit potential for most of the companies. The combination of AI and automation has already started to create business opportunities in multiple fields. By 2020, automation will create enough jobs with high wages for workers from all over the world. In that case, the workers would have to acquire new skills to match pace with the advanced machines.4. 5G network5G network will make our lives easier and faster. From the possibility of enhancing self-driving cars to running entire smart cities, 5G is most certainly the Next Big Thing in the generation of tech innovations. 5G is definitely like a boon for those people who are always looking for more speed, more features and more storage space. 5G has already been introduced to the 7 additional cities by the AT&T. It is expected to dominate the entire world by the year 2020. 5G is expected to provide speed of up to 5 gigabytes per second. It is at least 250 times more than the normal transmission speed.By 2020, 5G is all set to change the way we live, see, work, communicate and travel. We will be able to see and ride the self-driving cars and transfer videos or movies in just a short time span. Whether you have to upload5. Autonomous drivingElon Musk, the chief of Tesla, an automobile company recently said that he expects his company to come up with a successful autonomous vehicle by this year. Tesla also aims at designing vehicles that are capable of operating with a lesser degree of autonomy. Thus, the autonomous cars would consist of features such as the automated braking and lane changing. The autonomous driving technology also claims to improve the security and entertainment functions of the car. We can expect the automated cars to be more dependent on analytics and data capture.Simply put, these autonomous cars will redefine the automobile industry to a huge extent. Apart from cars, other vehicles such as trucking and shipping would become more autonomous. We can expect breakthroughs in the automobile industry throughout 2020. Waymo just finished a trial of autonomous vehicles in California which transported more than 10,000 people. Let’s just hope that 2020 could be a witness to an amazing technology such as autonomous cars.6. Prescriptive analyticsThese days, businesses are susceptible to a flood of data due to the organisational supply chain. Thus, the companies tend to turn to analytics solutions to identify the meaning or purpose of the huge piles of data and improve their decision making techniques. The world has already been exposed to the descriptive analytics, which uses data mining and data aggregation to summarize the raw data. These analytics helped people learn from their past behaviors and determine how they could impact the future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics lets us use simulation algorithms and optimization to determine the possible outcomes.Descriptive analytics answers the question “What has happened?” Prescriptive analytics answers the question “What should we do?” Predictive analytics estimates the chances of a future outcome. Companies can use this strategy to forecast what can happen in the future. The foundation of predictive analytics is based on probabilities. This analytics will identify specific patters in the data and implement statistical models and algorithms to determine the relationships between different sets of data.7. Predictive and personalized medicineTechnology has been influencing the healthcare industry at an unprecedented rate. As I mentioned before, 5G would help us fetch data from wearable devices like smartwatches. This feature will help us predict and treat our health issues with the utmost precision. The technology would be designed in such a way that the wearable would be able to keep track of the person’s basic health status. You will be notified about your health risks even if your body hasn’t shown any relevant symptoms. Even doctors would also be able to prescribe medicine through a data-driven understanding of how the medicine would be fruitful for a specific patient.You can expect to get a glimpse of more personalized approaches when it comes to treatment. This can also be termed as precision medicine which lets doctors apply the right treatment through relevant data analytics. Owing to the modern advancements in technology in the field of AI and genomics, doctors will have a deeper understanding of how our bodies work. We will also be able to understand if our bodies are equipped enough to fight off specific diseases. The bottom line is that 2020 is the time for predictive healthcare and effective personalized treatments.8. Bitcoin and blockchainCryptocurrency and blockchain are two of the most common topics of technology.Block chain technology is the digital ledger that has been preserved in a distributed network. This technology lets you distribute the network without copying it. The best thing about block chain technology is that it does not involve any centralized authority. Thus, fraudsters will not be able to alter the transactions. Nobody will be able to keep track on your online transactions. Thus, block chain technology is one of the safest options for people out there. Most importantly, you can enjoy the ownership of your own data by the year 2020.All in all, we can expect innumerable changes in technology by 2020. We have already been exposed to some innovations right from 2019. Now is the time for us to just wait for the innovations in the next year."
