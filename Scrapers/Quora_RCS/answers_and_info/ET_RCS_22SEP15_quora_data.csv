The way I make such predictions is by looking at technology that works in the lab today plus dreams that are achievable with a few scientific breakthroughs. Here are some ideas.\n\nLong distance travel will be by hyperloop or aircraft/rocket. Hyperloop is very efficient and fast, but limited to fixed routes. Earth- and space-bound craft will use similar propulsion (see below), and the main differences will be details like whether things are designed for low gravity.\n\nWe'll have autonomous personal multirotor aircraft (drones). We have the technology today but the energy costs are extreme.\n\nCheap clean energy changes everything and simply will happen. There are too many routes to it and everyone wants it (except the Saudis of course). Solar, thorium reactors, improved uranium reactors, and of course fusion could all play a role, especially in the next 30 years. But more likely some new technology will be invented. We know of plenty of ways to produce clean energy at planetary scale. We only need to figure out how to make them cheap.\n\nTravel to space will be somewhat routine thanks to a space elevator and/or nuclear rockets. Both technologies need one scientific breakthrough and then a bunch of engineering. The main problem will be that there isn't actually all that much reason for most people to go to space: science, tourism, satellite maintenance, perhaps a bit of asteroid mining. Humanity will launch the first interstellar probes and generally begin considering interstellar travel.\n\nThere will be a small colony on Mars similar to today's on Antarctica, mostly for research, and to satisfy the human desire to explore. You'll be able to visit, but the price will be incredible and few people will do so.\n\nAI will be roughly as smart as humans, and robots will do most of the jobs humans do today. Most things will be very cheap, but only high end engineers and artists will be able to find work. A basic income policy will have been introduced long before, and it will support most of the population. By 50 years from now this will seem perfectly normal. The few people who work will get benefits like waterfront homes and private resorts, along with extreme prestige. (This is the utopian version. I also have a dystopian version, but I'm in a good mood today.)\n\nEntertainment will be fully immersive. You won't be able to tell it's not real. You might even be able to erase the memory that you're in a program, so that you think you're really there. Maybe you're in a program right now and don't even know it.

People are therefore going to \u201clive worldwide\u201d, while staying put in their house. This in turn will lead people to live in little independent pockets; these will become little independent political entities.\n * warfare will increase, but the weaponry will be totally different: all electronic. Electronic warfare will be able to spy on you, to remotely activate objects and equipment close to you, to manipulate you and people around you, etc etc \u2026\n * the smallest equipment around us will become electronically enabled, turning on and off according to pre-programmed artificial intelligence.

You're looking at a couple of challenges. I noticed that most of the answers here involve transplanting it to a new body, which adds some problems, and I also have to note that you didn't specify what quality of life this brain needs, or whether it must communicate with the outside world.\n\nBut first, some background.\n\nI'm a neuroscience PhD student; I work mostly in electrophysiology with some computational stuff mixed in. And I regularly keep disembodied slices of mammalian brain tissue alive and signalling for hours. I'll describe that process, and then I'll discuss how this technique is adapted for whole brains.\n\nTo keep extracted brain tissue alive means that I need to replace the body systems that kept the brain healthy in the first place. I mix up a solution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), which is essentially Gatorade. It's got replacement electrolytes in the correct concentrations, a couple of compounds to buffer the solution and control the pH, and some nutrients for those living cells. I also mix in some antioxidants because the brain has had rather a dramatic shock and needs to be protected while the neurons heal or at least recover. I could expand on this if you'd like.\n\nNext, I start a drip which allows the ACSF to flow across or through an interface chamber where it can bathe the brain tissue, and I turn on a heater which brings the fluid up to body temperature. I also bubble oxygen into the ACSF, plus blow additional humidified oxygen across the surface of the brain slice if part of it will be above solution for electrode recording. Between the ACSF, the heat, and oxygen, the brain is now receiving what it requires for survival. And the flow rate is sufficient to carry waste away; in most of my interface chambers the ACSF is not recycled and is just suctioned into a collection flask for disposal. There are many reasons for this but chief among them are because of potential contamination with bacteria or metabolic wastes, and also because this setup allows me to deliver drugs or toxins and then let them wash away. Also, the amounts of ACSF I use are trivial, perhaps two liters on a busy day. Hardly worth reclaiming.\n\nAnyhow, this works wonderfully for a slice of brain tissue and I can keep several of them alive and active for several hours at a time. But these slices are 200 to 400 micrometers thick, so vasculature is unnecessary. What about a whole brain?\n\nEnter Dr. Marco De Curtis. He has advanced a technique for extracting a whole brain and tapping into its internal vasculature by catheterizing the Circle of Willis. This is kind of a big deal because it gives us access to intact systems; if I recall correctly, he published a paper where they kept the olfactory system attached and were able to study scent recognition. But there are a couple of problems with his approach; the biggest problem is that it does not work in the most common disease models of mice and rats. It only works in guinea pigs.\n\nIn fact, I work with a different rodent than any of those and it's an apt model for certain human diseases. A month ago my \""Principal Investigator\"" (PI; aka lead researcher) noted that our animals have a substantially similar vasculature to guinea pigs. He injected dye into the vessels, emailed Dr. De Curtis, and was encouraged to continue. This is an ongoing project; we've been having a lot of trouble because the vessels are so darned small. Fine Science Tools should be delivering some equipment this afternoon and we'll take another tilt at this windmill tomorrow.\n\nSo, to answer your question: Sure, a whole brain can be kept alive, at least potentially and with today's technology. It's mostly a matter of developing the existing techniques, and we're still working on it.\n\nAs for how long it can be kept alive - conceivably, for a normal lifespan. The challenges would be the same as with any open surgical wound. You'd need to keep it sterile, moist, and with ample circulation. Forever is not an option at this point, because biology (or medicine, which is applied biology) still has not solved senescence. In other words, the brain will still get old. It might even age faster without sensory inputs, which neatly segues into the last point:\n\nHoly hell, man, this is a disturbing question. At this time we have nearly zero means of delivering sensory stimulus to a brain; at best, if you were to keep the optic and auditory nerves intact, you'd be able to use something like cochlear implants and the current generation of very rudimentary replacement retinas. Other sensory stuff - balance, proprioception, touch, temperature - we still cannot reproduce on any level that approaches meaningful input, at least not directly to the brain. Maybe if you kept the spinal cord attached. \n\nOutputs face even more drastic problems; Utah arrays do allow for controlling a robot arm or a computer cursor. But this is very limited, even with the current state of the art. Heck, I have a couple of Utah arrays in the other room and I know how much information they can carry; it isn't much compared to the rich data usually moving through our nervous system. \n\nYou'd essentially be building a quadriplegic, except without even sensory input from the face via the cranial nerves which are usually intact after a spinal injury. This would be an extremely limited existence and, at the moment, horrifying to contemplate; in my opinion, even oblivion might be preferable. Imagine total locked-in syndrome, but worse.\n\nTo make this a desirable therapy will require several technologies to mature and a whole lot of science to be coordinated and engineered.\n\nThere's hope, though. Progress has been promising; if I had to pull a number out of the air, I'd say check back here in two decades. In the meantime, I'll keep working on my portion of the problem."", """,391,1071,1388,""": ""Faisal Hourani"", ""url"": ""https://www.quora.com/profile/Faisal-Hourani""}, "

Survival\n2. Trust\n3. Motivation\n4. Imagination\n## Survival\n\nYour survival driver is responsible for 3 key tasks:\n\n1. Fight\n2. Flight\n3. Freeze\nSurvival driver is activated in life threatening situations (ex: car about to hit you) and in modern times, stress can activate it; then what we have is:\n\n1. Fight: Aggressiveness\n2. Flight: Anxiety\n3. Freeze: Helplessness\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWhen you see someone who gets angry easily or anxious or feeling down, their survival brain is now driving them.\n\nThere is no use trying to reason with people being driven by their survival brain, everything is a threat to them at that point.\n\nWe need to bring the person out of the survival:\n\n1. If aggresive, go with the flow while remaining calm\n2. If anxious, offer options\n3. If helpless, give support\nYour survival driver usually needs to go through logic before activating but if it gets activated often (ex: constant stress from work) then it's constantly active.\n\nAt this point the person affected will easily get aggressive, anxious or helpless without a real threat.\n\nThe solution to this is to calm down your survival driver by constant meditation and being in a soothing environment - do not use drugs to calm yourself down as that will only make things worse in the long run.\n\n## Trust\n\nYour trust driver is interesting because it defines your position within a social group and works on 2 main areas within 4 axis:\n\nAreas:\n\n1. Self confidence (Trust in yourself)\n2. Trust in others\nAxis:\n\nX axis for self confidence (trust in yourself) and Y axis for trust in others\n\nYou want to be in the centre - assertive, confident and not worried about your actions.\n\nWe usually shift around the graph depending on where we are and who we are with.\n\nEach axis has 5 levels or stages we go through, 1 being the first and least hurtful stage and 5 being the last and worst.\n\nLevels 1\u20133 are treatable by yourself or with a close friend or family, if you reach levels 4-5 then it\u2019s recommended you seek professional help.\n\nWhen you have too much self confidence, you become dominant and it goes through the following stages:\n\n1. Flattery and seduction\n2. Manipulation\n3. Mockery\n4. Intimidation\n5. Sadism and cruelty\nWhen things go well for the dominant, they believe it\u2019s their doing.\n\nWhen things go wrong, it\u2019s someone elses fault.\n\nIf you know anyone that acts super charming and nice to people while they use them as a utility to obtain what they want, they have reached the top of dominance and need help.\n\nWhen you have too little self confidence, you become submissive and it goes through the following stages:\n\n1. Perfectionism and tendency to want to believe people too easily\n2. Excessive willingness to serve or please others\n3. Fear of breaking rules\n4. Panic attacks and guilt\n5. Hurting yourself and suicide\nWhen things go well for the submissive, they believe they got lucky.\n\nWhen things go wrong, they believe it\u2019s their fault.\n\nIf you know anyone that cuts themselves, they have reached the bottom of self confidence and need help - extreme submissiveness will lead to depression and suicide.\n\nNow we will talk about going left/right in the trust in others axis.\n\nIf you have too much trust in others, you reach axiality and it goes through the following stages:\n\n1. You are okay with sharing information with others and strangers\n2. You see hidden meanings\n3. You communicate without words\n4. You communicate with things\n5. You become gullible\nIn extreme case, the person gets used by people regularly and needs help.\n\nIf you have too little trust in others, you reach marginality and it goes through the following stages:\n\n1. Uneasiness at sharing\n2. Loss of contact\n3. Loss of connection\n4. Sense of exclusion\n5. Conspiracy - you believe people are plotting against you\nIn an extreme case, this turns into paranoia and the person needs help.\n\nSome things to note about the trust driver:\n\n * It takes a lot of time to grow, you cannot get more confident easily.\n * While you can easily lose your confidence and trust when you have a traumatic event.\n * When active, we can see territorial or power plays and the person does not question their own behaviour and so never learns - they need guidance\n * The good part, it only lasts for a short time each time it\u2019s activated.\n * So if someone is acting intimidating, give them a bit of time and firm resistance and they will back off on their own.\n## Motivation\n\nYour motivation driver stores your deepest motivations and raw emotions as well as your memories (the good, the bad and the ugly)\n\nMost of the time motivation driver is what\u2019s driving you around by running on autopilot by recognising situations you have been in and uses the standard operating procedure you teach it.\n\nYour motivation driver knows everything you have ever learnt!\n\nThis driver is super efficient because it uses the minimum attention span to carry out tasks, allowing us to do more than 2 things at once.\n\nFor example when you are driving a car and talking to your friend passenger at the same time, your motivation driver is in control.\n\nThis driver has 3 layers of motivation:\n\n1. Intrinsic: This is your fixed motivations that will never change and is partly formed by genetics and partly by your environment as a baby\nThis is why some things you do gives you energy and makes you happy even if you are not exactly good at it (ex: drawing) because it\u2019s an intrinsic motivation of yours.\n\nThis is also why some people can get extremely good at certain things (ex: drawing) since it\u2019s an intrinsic motivation that keeps them happy and working on until they master it.\n\nThe sweet spot is finding your intrinsic motivations and making a career out of it, then you are getting paid to do what you truly love to do and which actually makes you happy.\n\n2. Extrinsic: This is dynamic and keeps changing depending on your environment and trends, it stores what you currently like and dislike.\n\nEverything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)\n\nThe interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3\u20136 months.\n\n3. Obsessions: When things you like stay in your extrinsic long enough, they become deeply rooted in the 3rd layer and become obsessions.\n\nThis stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.\n\nWhen it\u2019s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.\n\n# Imagination:\n\nThis is the marvel of evolution, it\u2019s what makes us human.\n\nYour imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.\n\nIt should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.\n\nPeople usually don\u2019t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.\n\nExamples:\n\n * Atari and HP turning down Steve Job\u2019s ideas\n * IBM believing there is no market for PCs\nThese mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.\n\nWhen your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.\n\nHow to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:\n\n * Why am I feeling like this?\n * What am I basing this decision on?\n * How can we do this differently? how can we do it better?\nMaking yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.\n\nIn conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.\n\nHope this helps you as much as it helped me.\n\nI might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.\n\nAll the best!"", """,450,1197,27283,""": ""Gurmeet Bishnoi"", ""url"": ""https://www.quora.com/profile/Gurmeet-Bishnoi""}, "

Structural components such as bones and joints just need to be fixed into place, avoid rejection, allow for movement, and support compressive forces.\n\nOther simple organs and tissue such as intestines, blood vessels, ureters, and heart valves can be replaced or reinforced fairly easily with biomaterials.\n\nOther organs can be replaced or augmented with machines both inside and outside the body. LVAD, impella, and intra-aortic balloon pumps help the left ventricle pump blood in patients with systolic heart failure. ECMO replaces heart and lung function in patients with severe organ failure. Hemodialysis replaces kidney function in patients with end-stage renal failure. Insulin pumps take over partial pancreatic function by managing insulin secretion in patients with type I diabetes. Ventilators pump air into and out of the lungs in patients with respiratory failure.\n\nBut consider an organ such as the liver. How are you going to replace something so complex?! You need something that detoxifies and metabolizes hundreds of different substances, stores and produces glycogen, makes albumin and other serum proteins, creates and processes lipoproteins, etc. There is no way a machine can do all that\u2026yet.\n\nIt's also much easier to replace certain organs with donor tissue which you know will function similar to the original.\n\nYou can transplant the following organs:\n\n * Heart\n * Lung\n * Liver\n * Kidney\n * Pancreas\n * Intestines\nAnd the following tissue:\n\n * Cornea\n * Heart valves\n * Tendons\n * Skin\n * Veins\n * Bone\n * Bone marrow\nYou can also replace important GI flora (bacteria) using a procedure called a fecal transplant.

I expect the cost of batteries to change over the next 2 years as the Tesla GigaFactory comes online. With that change I expect the 16 to 20 percent per year increases to continue. This would lead to 2 doublings of installed Solar and a 40 percent decrease in panel costs. Robotic installation will make panel installation much, much cheaper over time. How Cheap Can Solar Get?

I believe this will be a watershed moment and in the following half decade medical diagnostic devices will become part of the Internet of Things.

The question, \u2018what\u2019s next\u2019 is a constant in a tech geek\u2019s professional life. When it comes to technology, there is always something fresh and the hunt to develop and implement a new technology that could augment businesses is unyielding. The inquisitiveness to know and seek knowledge about the technology and how it is going to impact the daily lives of the human species.\n\nTechnology is true, one of the greatest change agents in the present world, and is moving faster than ever before. It has the supremacy to offer innovative solutions to global challenges. The emerging technologies have brought a radical shift in the information, technology and development sector and thereby impacting the other industries along with sales and marketing business segments well. Mapping the imminent technology proposal of the business demands the business leaders to first identify these emerging technology trends. They ought to learn the dynamics of the technology and how it would impact the present and the future of the business.\n\nHere are some of the most revolutionary and disruptive emerging technologies:\n\nMachine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have taken huge leaps in the recent past few years. For example, a business can apply machine learning and offer the consumer a fresh purchasing option, depending on the analysis of the history of the purchasing pattern and taste of the consumer. Machine Learning could be an effective tool for cyber financial frauds. Artificial Intelligence could be a more robust system to combat the new complex cyber-attacks. The ML and AI technologies blend a variety of other skills and expertise such as neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing. This also includes other statistical concepts to appreciate, learn, forecast, acclimate and potentially function autonomously.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\nIoT is seen as the change agent for the luxurious and effective lifestyle for the consumers, offering valuable customer interactions and exceptional experiences for them. IoT is one of the most exciting areas of focus today. The idea revolves around the nano-sensors circulating in the human body or any specific object. Once connected with the technology, this is going to have a proliferating impact on the various sectors such as medicine, agriculture, architecture etc.\n\nBlockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain Technology is the disruptor of the Financial Industry. Mostly espoused by the cryptocurrency industry, today, even the conventional banks have started to clout its usage. The rise of bitcoin industry has raised the ambiguous inquisitiveness of the blockchain technology affecting the emerging markets. The blockchain technology is a digital principled ledger which creates numerous chained blocks of data and ensures sales and marketing resources are focused on the numbers of the business.\n\nAugmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)\n\nThe fascinating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is the current catchphrase of every technocrat. The AR and VR are potentially remodelling the way consumers interact with each other and the technology, inspiring the growth of pervasive settings. For instance, AR allows the user to blend the real and virtual world. With the help of VR technology, firms can deploy virtual business training and remote involvement. . The technology is also helpful to know in-depth about the changing tastes of the target audience and has immense potential to influence the business strategies.\n\nBig Data\n\nBig data technology is a very simple and effective concept. An exceptional method to collect, organise and comprehend the data for the benefit of the business. The quantitative output of data-driven analysis is one of the core strengths of big data technology. The Big data technology involves building huge data architectures to organise and analyze the unstructured data and offer real-time value for the business. The vast augmentation of the digital data has enabled not just big, but also the small and medium enterprises to disrupt the power of big-data. This technology with the right expertise would help the business to lower the cost of consumer gaining, augment sales and step into new business markets.\n\nMarket Automation\n\nEvery entrepreneur and business tycoon must be aware that marketing automation is here to stay. In the present-day scenario, sales and marketing personnel must automate processes in every way possible to offer the best experiences for the consumers. Businesses must leverage the benefits of this exclusive technology to eradicate the human-exclusive tasks. A robust automation tool is tailored to the explicit requirements of the business.The online e-commerce leverages the best of automation technology. An e-commerce industry can use automation technology to understand the customer\u2019s buying cycle and share the right message at the right time. For example, if he or she has left the shopping cart without making a purchase.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nThe market forecast states that in the next five years, 50% of the business organisations and global companies are moving their data to the cloud. This also points that Cloud Computing Technology companies such as Microsoft have greater responsibility to safeguard and secure the consumer valuable data. In the healthcare sector, operations and medical organisations can maintain the patient data, check the status of the patient and offer necessary treatments as and when necessary, without storing the data in the hardcopy of files.\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments below."", """,1,254,606,""": ""Sam Huleatt"", ""url"": ""https://www.quora.com/profile/Sam-Huleatt""}, "

Quote of features from Docker web pages:\n\n\n%3E Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete file-system that contains everything it needs to run: code, run-time, system tools, system libraries \u2013 anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.\nIt is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.\n\nCheck out : Docker [ https://www.docker.com/ ]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5POuMHxW-0\n * Security-\nNetatmo Presence\n\nThe Netatmo Presence is a smart outdoor security camera that can tell you who, and what, has entered your yard.The Netatmo Presence, introduced on Monday at CES, is an outdoor security cam that takes things one step farther\u2014it can distinguish between animals, cars, and people to let you know which has been detected outside your home.\n\nIt connects with a smartphone, computer, tablet or Apple Watch via Wi-Fi, allowing owners to modify its settings through an app. On the app, users will be able to adjust the perimeter for the security camera's field of view and set specific zones to monitor, and they can turn the floodlight option on or off there too. The device uses infrared to see in the dark at night when the floodlight is off.\n\nFrom a design perspective, the Presence looks more like a standard issue outdoor flood light than a security camera, which is a good way to trick any would-be wrongdoers. I'm not in love with the design, which is a little blocky for my taste, though ultimately the minimal aluminum build is pretty inoffensive. It's rated IP66 to withstand harsh outdoor conditions, like ice, rain, sun, and wind.\n\nThe camera records full HD 1080p video. It has a 100-degree field of view, and a very impressive 65-foot detection range (many outdoor cameras provide a range closer to 25 feet). There's also infrared night vision, and Netatmo uses end-to-end encryption to make sure no one else can access your camera feed.\n\nCheck out : Smart Outdoor Security Camera with App [ https://www.netatmo.com/en-US/product/presence ]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFAqGiIxQNc\nStorage -\n\nHybrid cloud storage\n\nIt is a combination of public cloud storage and private cloud storage where some critical data resides in the enterprise's private cloud while other data is stored and accessible from a public cloud storage provider started by Microsoft Azure and storsimple cloud computing and platform services.\n\nWith hybrid cloud storage, enterprises are able to mix and match cloud storage resources between local data center infrastructure and scalable, on-demand infrastructure, with the cloud storage provider typically fully managing the cloud storage.\n\nHybrid cloud storage combines the advantages of scalability, reliability, rapid deployment and potential cost savings of public cloud storage with the security and full control of private cloud storage.\n\nHybrid cloud storage more accurately means using on-premise storage and storage in the public cloud to create a greater overall value \u2013 as a kind of mash-up. You could have some data on one and some on the other, depending on its risk classification or its latency and bandwidth needs. Alternatively, you could federate a private storage cloud with a public cloud, using public cloud storage for archive, backup, disaster recovery, workflow sharing and distribution.\n\nCheck out : Hybrid Cloud Storage from Microsoft [ http://www.controlyourstorage.com/ ]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxi6FBJQA_M\nAlso check out : What's New With Data Domain?

The way I make such predictions is by looking at technology that works in the lab today plus dreams that are achievable with a few scientific breakthroughs. Here are some ideas.\n\nLong distance travel will be by hyperloop or aircraft/rocket. Hyperloop is very efficient and fast, but limited to fixed routes. Earth- and space-bound craft will use similar propulsion (see below), and the main differences will be details like whether things are designed for low gravity.\n\nWe'll have autonomous personal multirotor aircraft (drones). We have the technology today but the energy costs are extreme.\n\nCheap clean energy changes everything and simply will happen. There are too many routes to it and everyone wants it (except the Saudis of course). Solar, thorium reactors, improved uranium reactors, and of course fusion could all play a role, especially in the next 30 years. But more likely some new technology will be invented. We know of plenty of ways to produce clean energy at planetary scale. We only need to figure out how to make them cheap.\n\nTravel to space will be somewhat routine thanks to a space elevator and/or nuclear rockets. Both technologies need one scientific breakthrough and then a bunch of engineering. The main problem will be that there isn't actually all that much reason for most people to go to space: science, tourism, satellite maintenance, perhaps a bit of asteroid mining. Humanity will launch the first interstellar probes and generally begin considering interstellar travel.\n\nThere will be a small colony on Mars similar to today's on Antarctica, mostly for research, and to satisfy the human desire to explore. You'll be able to visit, but the price will be incredible and few people will do so.\n\nAI will be roughly as smart as humans, and robots will do most of the jobs humans do today. Most things will be very cheap, but only high end engineers and artists will be able to find work. A basic income policy will have been introduced long before, and it will support most of the population. By 50 years from now this will seem perfectly normal. The few people who work will get benefits like waterfront homes and private resorts, along with extreme prestige. (This is the utopian version. I also have a dystopian version, but I'm in a good mood today.)\n\nEntertainment will be fully immersive. You won't be able to tell it's not real.

Smart robot servants or flying cars of the 2000s have not appeared as we saw in the famous animated sitcom \""The Jetsons\"" in the 1970s. However, recent technological developments show that we will be able to make predictions much more easily in the coming years. It is possible to say that these predictions will be true to a large extent.\n\nA group comprising of academicians and futurists in the U.K. have contemplated on what the world will be like 50 years later in 2069. This group prepared a report under the sponsorship of Samsung and shared its results. Here are 10 predictions for the future world:\n\nUnderground roads: Underground means of transport that are capable of traveling at the speed of sound will be developed. These roads established on the tube system will be linked to each other. For example, this tube system will connect the U.K. to Europe and carry people to Scandinavia in an hour.\n\nUnderground skyscrapers: These multistory buildings that will be built underground will be earthquake resistant and offer many living spaces like home, office, shopping centers and gyms.\n\nSelf-cleaning houses: When you are not at home or you are sleeping, technology will be developed that will clean the house via a button.\n\nSpace hotels: Journeys to the moon and other planets will be possible. These journeys will be performed with a system that will adapt to the gravity of each planet.\n\n3D organs: There will be no organ failure in the future. Organs that are 3D will be produced to change organs or make them function better.\n\nBug-burger takeaways: In the next 50 years, bugs will be the most important protein sources for people.\n\nFlying buses or cabs: It is known that air cabs will start serving some years later. High-power drone copters like flying buses will be an indispensable means of public transportation.\n\nBody implants: These implants will be used to learn how the health of our bodies is and to measure our body values. Moreover, they will work as translators.\n\n4D air sports: Air sports that can be performed on hoverboards will be found. These sports will present a 4D visual feast by bringing thousands of people together in stadiums.\n\nInteractive virtual reality films: You will find yourself in a film by wearing virtual reality (VR) clothing at home and experience the feeling of touch.

This is amazing considering the impact that it will have on the evolution of mankind.\n\nThis new technology will put us into space like we see in sci-fi. I have a working proof of concept prototype and in June 2018, I took it to my nation\u2019s capital, Ottawa, to meet with two government officials. One of these guys is a smart fellow with 4 degrees, two of which are in physics and in engineering. After seeing the prototype and the explanation of its principle, he kept repeating, \u201cYou are going to win the Nobel Prize\u201d. I have started to think that it won\u2019t happen in my lifetime, because everyone is totally ignoring this. I have gone to media and aerospace companies, through the internet and by phone, to tell them about this new technology. They totally ignore me to the point of not even returning my emails or phone calls.\n\nThis new technology will replace all rockets, jet engines, air and marine propellers and even many commercial lifting devices and even create lifting devices for domestic use.\n\nIn space it will continually accelerate so you will have gravity in your spacecraft while accelerating. Then at the halfway point of the journey you turn the spacecraft around and re-engage the CP to decelerate, and you have gravity again in your spacecraft. It means that people will be leaving for day shifts mining on the moon and return home for supper on the same day. A trip to Mars will be little more than a day-trip.\n\nI have some very smart people telling me that this will make me a billionaire, but unless the CP starts getting some attention soon, it may not happen in my lifetime.\n\nI have had a lot of abuse from people who have not even seen the invention and yet feel compelled to throw their insults at me. After one of these abusive types actually saw the working prototype, he just went away, silent. No acknowledgement, no compliment, nothing. Others say that you cannot create thrust in a completely closed unit because it goes against Newton\u2019s 3rd Law. Well it doesn\u2019t go against it, it just expands it. Newton did not take into consideration the potential of redirecting reaction in multiple directions at a right angle to the initial action. It is so simple. And that is what I have done with centrifugal force.\n\nThe uses of this invention are too numerous to list them all, but here are a few: farm seeders and harvesters will be able to hover over wet fields, allowing the crops to be seeded and harvested when traditional equipment would get bogged down. That will extend the growing seasons up to two months in some areas.\n\nImagine wheel chairs that can fly up stairs, cars that hover over roads and water. Initially they will probably have altitude/height governors on them even though the CP will be capable of unlimited altitudes. Otherwise people would be killing themselves going outside of breathable atmosphere.\n\nSubmarines that can travel at 100 Mph. All marine craft will have the CP inside of their hulls, eliminating the need to remove the propeller shaft and replace the seals annually. Nothing will extend outside of the hull. That will be a huge cost saving.\n\nThe cost of infrastructure will drop because there will be limited costs to maintain roads or even have bridges. There are some asteroids in the asteroid belt that have trillions of dollars worth of metals. Those can be brought to Earth within a day or two.\n\nOn construction sites you will be able to strap a CP onto something heavy like a bundle of drywall, and just float it into the area where it is needed.\n\nPlease understand, the CP is not an energy generator. Think of it this way: you take a propeller off of an airplane and replace it with a CP. The gas motor still turns the CP. The big difference is that it is far more efficient and quiet. The plane will go way faster and the only noise will be the internal combustion engine turning the CP.\n\nIn space it will be powered by an electric motor that will be powered by a small nuclear reactor. The kind that CANDU Reactors makes (about the size of the average bathroom) would be perfect. A suitcase sized amount of fuel will power it for years. You could also use batteries/capacitors and solar panels to power it.\n\nThe uses for this new technology are limitless. And yet, no one will take me seriously unless I force my way in front of them and give them a demonstration. That is not always possible nor desirable.\n\nI have been posting on boards like this for years, trying to get the attention of people who could use this technology and take it to the next level. Mostly, all I get is criticism from small minded people who refuse to do some investigating into this. I have invested almost a million Cdn into this. Now it seems that I will have to build more than just a proof of concept prototype, I will have to build an actual working, practical prototype. More of my personal money. Unbelievable. What is really unbelievable is just how obtuse the masses have been about this. This is something that I am prepared to show anyone, and I am prepared to discuss, debate, whatever, with anyone. The more of my own money that I have to put into this, the more expensive it is going to be to invest in or even be an end user of.\n\nIt is inevitable that this technology will be generally accepted.

Fission Ignited Fusion is not uncontrolled fusion in any sense (as is also the case with an internal combustion engine - you only get an explosion within a cylinder of a magnitude equal to the fuel and air supplied - not any more and not any less). Inertial Confinement Fission Ignited Fusion is controlled fusion and produces practical commercially significant amounts of fusion energy reliably from the same D-T or D-D fusion reactions as tokamaks or stellarator experiments (there is actually no difference at all in the fusion fuels burned or the nuclear waste [helium] produced).\n\nFission Ignited Inertial Confinement Fusion is practical nuclear fusion that works now (not always just 30 years from now) and could be harnessed today and used to lift the conditions of all mankind.\n\nIn modern implementations[1], Fusion Ignited Fission can use as little as 0.25 grams of fissile U233, U235, or Pu239 to ignite about 8 grams of Deuterium using D-D fusion and produce, with help of a fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator), a fusion burst of about 100 Gigajoules per shot (the energy released in efficiently burning about 779 gallons of gasoline).\n\nMagnetic Confinement tokamaks like ITER will not begin to operate with DT fusion fuel which could permit break-even energy production until 2035.\n\nWhy sink all fusion effort into ITER and wait another 20 years before even starting to explore commercial forms of fusion energy?\n\nDoes it not make some sense to explore the ICF fusion technology that has been demonstrated to currently reliably work, and try to evolve the technology into a reliable and cost effective pure fusion commercial form?\n\nThe resources needed to finish developing commercial forms of fission-fusion and pure ICF fusion are already in place.

5,https://www.quora.com/In-future-IOT-Internet-of-things-is-trending-technology-or-not," ""Thank you for the A2A, Soumyadipta!\nFinally one from you, as per my respected field :)\n\na) Given this topic, you can read it from anywhere. Via Net, via cell phone, via satellite\u2014it would seem that the sky\u2019s the limit. But the sky\u2019s not the limit at all.\nFor an Internet of Things, the sky is the metric. \nGlobal positioning satellites provide a splendid source of measurement for the world. Your monitors are hooked into the satellite based Global Positioning System. \nThen your network become a mobile system of interlinked objects that are traceable across the planet\u2019s surface, from outer space, with one-meter accuracy, around the clock, from pole to pole. A Global Positioning System is a literal world-beater\u2014 although satellite coverage breaks up whenever you move under a roof. A Local Positioning System, indoors, is handier yet. Global Positioning works by combining and analyzing signals from several cooperating satellites, up in space. The same thing can work on a local scale, inside a house.\n\nIf you have multiple monitors combined in a network, that means you can add radio signals together, and triangulate them. It\u2019s an indoor, radar air-traf\ufb01c control system for objects. Real air traf\ufb01c control systems are grim, complex bureaucracies, heavy with fail-safes. Who can make objects that integrate elegantly and dependably within an Internet of Things? Who can make that system as relatively simple and inviting as, say, the Internet\u2019s Web browsers and Weblogs? It\u2019s a design space rife with profound opportunity. You, a human being, don\u2019t want the cognitive burden of knowing what your host of objects is doing all the time. What you want is the executive brie\ufb01ng. Management has its perks as well as its burdens. The drawback of becoming a Wrangler is a ceaseless struggle through changing \ufb01elds of data and relationships. The bene\ufb01t is that many previously knotty problems simply vaporize, they become trivial. The primary advantage of an Internet of Things is that I no longer inventory my possessions inside my own head. They\u2019re inventoried through an auto-magical inventory voodoo, work done far beneath my notice by a host of machines. I no longer bother to remember where I put things. Or where I found them. Or how much they cost. And so forth. I just ask. Then I am told with instant real-time accuracy.\n\nI have an Internet of Things with a search engine. So I no longer hunt anxiously for my missing shoes in the morning. I just Google them. As long as machines can crunch the complexities, their interfaces make my relationship to objects feel much simpler and more immediate. I am at ease in materiality in a way that people never were before. Although I live in a much cleaner way than my forebears did, I am not achingly burdened by glum moral guilt about my acts of consumption. That\u2019s no longer a burdensome matter requiring constant conscientious decision-making on my own part. Instead, it\u2019s been designed into the metrics of the production stream. Whenever I shop, I shop with a wand in my hand. It would never occur to me to shop without a \ufb01lter and an interface. And someone built that for me, it was designed\u2014as a Wrangler, I need an interface for capitalism itself. In the old days, the best term for an idea like that was probably a \u201clifestyle magazine.\u201d Those toney, glossy little empires were the native haunts of the design profession. But those things were made of paper. They just sat there on a table. They couldn\u2019t do anything. But now that design decisions are at my \ufb01ngertips instead of stuck on paper, I can do a lot.\n\nb) \u201cIoT will boost the economy while improving the citizens\u2019 lives\u201d\n\nAnalysts predict that new Internet of Things(IoT) product sand services will grow exponentially in the coming years. I \ufb01rmly believe that the Commission will continue to support research in IoT in Horizon 2020, the forthcoming EU research and innovation framework program starting in 2014.\n\nIn order to enable a fast uptake of the IoT, key issues like identi\ufb01cation, privacy and security and semantic inter operable routes have to be tackled. The interplay with cloud technologies, big data and future networks like 5G have also to be taken into account. Open and integrated IoT environments will boost the competitiveness of European SMEs and make people\u2019s daily life easier. For instance, it will be easier for patients to receive continuous care and for companies to ef\ufb01ciently source components for their products. This will lead to better services, huge savings and a smarter use of resources. To achieve these promising results, I think it is vital to enhance users\u2019 trust in the Internet of Things. The data protection legislation and the cyber security strategy proposed by the European Commission clearly go in this direction.\n\nCredits:\n\n * Bruce Sterling, American science fiction author\n * M\u00e1rio Campolargo DG CONNECT, European Commission, Belgium\n"", """,4,15542,1028,""": ""Don Shiner"", ""url"": ""https://www.quora.com/profile/Don-Shiner""}, "

The way I make such predictions is by looking at technology that works in the lab today plus dreams that are achievable with a few scientific breakthroughs. Here are some ideas.\n\nLong distance travel will be by hyperloop or aircraft/rocket. Hyperloop is very efficient and fast, but limited to fixed routes. Earth- and space-bound craft will use similar propulsion (see below), and the main differences will be details like whether things are designed for low gravity.\n\nWe'll have autonomous personal multirotor aircraft (drones). We have the technology today but the energy costs are extreme.\n\nCheap clean energy changes everything and simply will happen. There are too many routes to it and everyone wants it (except the Saudis of course). Solar, thorium reactors, improved uranium reactors, and of course fusion could all play a role, especially in the next 30 years. But more likely some new technology will be invented. We know of plenty of ways to produce clean energy at planetary scale. We only need to figure out how to make them cheap.\n\nTravel to space will be somewhat routine thanks to a space elevator and/or nuclear rockets. Both technologies need one scientific breakthrough and then a bunch of engineering. The main problem will be that there isn't actually all that much reason for most people to go to space: science, tourism, satellite maintenance, perhaps a bit of asteroid mining. Humanity will launch the first interstellar probes and generally begin considering interstellar travel.\n\nThere will be a small colony on Mars similar to today's on Antarctica, mostly for research, and to satisfy the human desire to explore. You'll be able to visit, but the price will be incredible and few people will do so.\n\nAI will be roughly as smart as humans, and robots will do most of the jobs humans do today. Most things will be very cheap, but only high end engineers and artists will be able to find work. A basic income policy will have been introduced long before, and it will support most of the population. By 50 years from now this will seem perfectly normal. The few people who work will get benefits like waterfront homes and private resorts, along with extreme prestige. (This is the utopian version. I also have a dystopian version, but I'm in a good mood today.)\n\nEntertainment will be fully immersive. You won't be able to tell it's not real. You might even be able to erase the memory that you're in a program, so that you think you're really there. Maybe you're in a program right now and don't even know it.

3,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-solutions-to-emerging-issues-in-communication," ""The most frustrating thing about technology in the classroom for me is the extent to which we depend on it and are expected to use it. Many parents do what they can to limit their child(ren)\u2019s screen time at home. Then their child(ren) go off to school and get a device put in front of them. I understand that technology is our present and our future, but there are a number of problems with the overuse of it in school, in my view.\n\n1. It disconnects the student from the teacher. When the students have a screen in front of them, there is a barrier that affects what they learn in class, the student-teacher relationship, and the extent to which the student engages in the classroom experience.\n2. It disconnects the students from each other. I had an unusually small class during my first period this year- there were only 12 students. We met five days a week for 44 minutes a day. Towards the end of the year, it became clear that one of the students didn't know the names of three or four of his classmates. In my mind I blamed the Chromebooks that the kids had in front of them nearly every day as the biggest, albeit not the only, contributing factor.\n3. It appears to affect the students\u2019 memories. Constant access to information online meant that they didn't need to remember things in the way they would have had to otherwise.\n4. It\u2019s stressful for the students because there is a tendency to multitask. Multitasking increases stress and anxiety, and it lowers memory retention. On top of that, it causes kids to take a longer time getting things done than the same tasks would normally take them if they were focused and not distracted. This is already a problem for them at home, I hate to see it as a problem for them at school, too. Students often report spending hours on their homework, but they neglect to mention that they were on social media, iChat, etc. while they were doing their work.\nThese are just some of my frustrations with technology in the classroom. When used in moderation, there are quite a few great uses for technology in the classroom as well. It isn't black and white."", """,7,931,704,""": ""Danjal Veskandar"", ""url"": ""https://www.quora.com/profile/Danjal-Veskandar""}, "
4,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-solutions-to-emerging-issues-in-communication," ""\n%3E Q %3E What are some examples of emerging trends in communication skills?\nMore than ever first impressions and perception are key.\n\nIf you are unskilled or unqualified but can talk a good game? Then odds are you\u2019ll get an in or a chance. You\u2019ll then get the opportunity to build up experience and even if it won\u2019t work out right way you can use that experience on top of your verbal ability to get another foot in the door at the next job opportunity.\n\nOn the other hand if you are competent at something but you might not make the best first impressions because you\u2019re socially awkward?\n\nEven if you HAVE certification/qualifications, it won\u2019t matter.\n\nNetworking is vastly more likely to get you a job than actual qualifications. Knowing the right people is key.\n\nThis is even more true in company settings where hiring is being done by HR/recruitment personel who are hired for their \u201cpeople skills\u201d but frequently lack a lot of the actual job-related skills.\n\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example of what happened at my workplace. (Callcenter - specific project for a local ISP)\n\nCoworker of mine who is quite competent wanted to pursue an advancement track for agents to become supervisor. The person in charge of hiring not only turned him down because they thought he was \u201ctoo junior\u201d, but recommended him to take pointers from another coworker.\n\nSaid coworker (someone who talks a good game but that\u2019s really about it) totally failed their assessment.\n\nThe business unit manager heard that the competent guy was turned down and insisted he be given a chance. They had to pull some strings and specifically tell them they allow him to take the assessment.\n\nNot only did he pass the assessment - he did better than just about anyone they\u2019ve seen in the past half decade or more. And requested if they could use his stuff as reference material to showcase for future candidates and so on.\n\nSo to recap:\n\n1. The agent that was unqualified but talked a good game was both pointed out as a \u201cgood example\u201d and given a chance to enter the assessment right away. But failed horrifically.\n2. The agent that was qualified but didn\u2019t make the expected impression and was almost not given a chance at all got the opportunity because they knew the right people who pulled strings for them. Proceeded to blow everything out of the water and is now used as an example to aspire after.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how skilled or competent you are if you don\u2019t make good first impressions, don\u2019t talk a good game and/or don\u2019t know the right people to pull strings for you."", """,1,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN

The students must learn how to use the technology before they can learn with a computer-based program. In corporate training, employees often prefer live instructors. E-learning is cheaper, not necessarily more effective.\n\nI worked with students using Carnegie Math for Algebra. We had mixed results. The learning was blended with classroom training, but some students progressed through the Carnegie math faster than classroom instruction and some were much slower. When students failed to understand how all the hints, graphs and required inputs worked, they would be given twice as many problems as other students and began to detest this program. A proctor knowledgeable in the Carnegie Math had to be there to help students at all times. This really defeated the purpose of using technology. Using Alice for introduction to computer programming was a little more successful, but computer programming was not a required course, so students not interested in programming would not take it."", """,4,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN
7,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-solutions-to-emerging-issues-in-communication," ""Here are some ways I use technology in my classroom that makes teaching that much easier for me:\n\n1. Record/post/reuse lessons and assignments. I\u2019ve been using online classrooms (Edmodo and Google Classroom) my entire teaching career. Most years, I also teach the same exact subject to two classes of the same grade. Recording things and putting them online allows me to reuse lessons, which saves a ton of time in the long run. I can do the same for assignments. For example, just a few weeks ago I recorded a 10-minute lesson on subordinate clauses, then assigned some classwork on that concept, and walked the students through the first few questions on the classwork. I had to do that for four different classes, so I just recorded myself as I did it for the first class, then posted that recording online for the other three classes. Then, I only needed to be present and available for questions in the classroom, while the students worked at their own pace.\n2. Record/reuse lessons 2.0. If you teach the same things year after year, as I do, you can often just reuse the previous year\u2019s recorded material. That also saves time.\n3. Record/post lessons 3.0. If students are absent, or simply don\u2019t do their work one day, I no longer have to hunt down copies of what they missed and reteach them the lessons individually. It\u2019s all online. The responsibility to get what they missed or didn\u2019t do is all on them.\n4. No more standing at the board to teach. I use an iPad hooked up to a projector along with a document projecting app when I teach now. I stand behind the students (so I can see what\u2019s on their individual computer screens, and also so I don\u2019t block their views of the screen in front of the classroom), and the students can see what I\u2019m writing on my iPad projected onto the big screen. I can take pictures of pages from their textbooks and use the iPad to mark over them, which makes explaining some grammar concepts much easier.\n5. Seamless communication with parents. No more sending notes home with students and hoping the parents actually get them. No more calling home and hoping that the parents are there and in the mood to hear about their child\u2019s exploits at school. No more documenting those notes and calls, either. Now it\u2019s all done via email, with the administration BCC\u2019d and copies saved in the sent email folder for butt-covering purposes.\n"", """,55,1400,120,""": ""Dave Wheatley"", ""url"": ""https://www.quora.com/profile/Dave-Wheatley-4""}, "
