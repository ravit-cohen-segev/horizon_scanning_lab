We have the technology today but the energy costs are extreme.Cheap clean energy changes everything and simplyTravel to space will be somewhat routine thanks to a space elevator and/or nuclear rockets. Both technologies need one scientific breakthrough and then a bunch of engineering. The main problem will be that there isn't actually all that much reason for most people to go to space: science, tourism, satellite maintenance, perhaps a bit of asteroid mining. Humanity will launch the first interstellar probes and generally begin considering interstellar travel.There will be a small colony on Mars similar to today's on Antarctica, mostly for research, and to satisfy the human desire to explore. You'll be able to visit, but the price will be incredible and few people will do so.AI will be roughly as smart as humans, and robots will do most of the jobs humans do today. Most things will be very cheap, but only high end engineers and artists will be able to find work. A basic income policy will have been introduced long before, and it will support most of the population. By 50 years from now this will seem perfectly normal. The few people who work will get benefits like waterfront homes and private resorts, along with extreme prestige. (This is the utopian version. I also have a dystopian version, but I'm in a good mood today.)Entertainment will be fully immersive. You won't be able to tell it's not real. You might even be able to erase the memory that you're in a program, so that you think you're really there. Maybe you're in a program right now and don't even know it. Say hi to the robots for me when you wake up.","45,199 followers",David Seidman,999,3.6K,82.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend.

25,"In 10–30 years the world would be much different.Technology:In 10–30 years the world would be much different.Technology:Genetics will improve and medicine will advance tremendously in a way life expectancy will grow dramatically.Climate change:A. Technologically, companies will continue to develop clean forms of energy despite the fact low oil and coal price. Companies such as Tesla will become new Exxon Mobile or Ford. Private citizens will act in order to support companies to develop clean energy through crowdfunding which will be one perhaps the most used form of finance.These efforts will be directed to India whereaprox. 300 million people will move from rural areas to urban, Brazil, South Africa, the United States, Russia (or what will be there after Russia), China (a lot of small regions, not today’s China).The idea is that in the next 10 years people and companies will act with visionary politicians such as Modi, Peña Nieto, Macron, Trudeau to promote clean energy around the globe.Geopolitics:Russia will collapse in the same way the Soviet Union collapsed. USSR collapsed when their defense budget was highly increased and when oil price was low. Now, in 2017 we have exact the same conditions. After all, Vladimir Putin is in charge since 2000. The last generation doesn’t know another political leader than Putin. They will act in the same way Egyptian people acted in 2011. Yes, there will be a Russian Spring, not in 10 years but in less than 3. In 10 years there will be a lot of small states.China will implode in a less centralized government. The gap between regions and rich-poor people is too high to be ignored. Chinese regions will act independently according to their economic interests.Japan may solve its demographic crisis using robots for manufacturing. Immigrants will not invade Japan in the next 10 years. Japan will reconquer its lost territories from Russia and will dominate China once again.With a low oil price, Saudi Arabia will no longer exist as a state. They currently implemented Strategy 2030, a national strategy to diversify Saudi economy. But because of its religious influence and social structure, it is too late to act. A good example in diversifying an oil based economy is the United Arab Emirates that will become a financial hub, an educational world center and perhaps a technological power.South America will grow if it will remain stable. This region will develop tremendously. With a lack of external threats and lack of internal rivalry, those countries will form an effective economic bloc. The new generation of politicians will fight against corruption and organized crime. In the next 10–30 years we will talk about “The Mexican Model” which will be exported to Central and South America. Current Mexican president is a reformist who is fighting to stabilize the country and eliminate drug cartels. Mexico has an enormous potential to develop due to its ocean coastlines, natural resources, and workforce.The United States has to turn back being the world leader. Trump’s approach on international relation is very similar to China foreign policy: bilateral negotiations, zero-sum game, isolationism. I expect only 4 years of Trump, then I expect a left-wing president such as Bernie Sanders. The reason is young people are involved in the social debate and they are willing to promote the values such as universal free education and healthcare, equality of chances. In the same way, the future generation of European will act to establish a fiscal union, in the US next generation will act to introduce free access to education and healthcare. Due to the technological and financial development, we could expect a success.African continent will transform itself dramatically. Countries such as Nigeria will become the new china while Chinese provinces will develop themselves in the same way Japan did. Africa is very unpredictable because of its lack of political institutions. The political risk of investment in Africa is too high now. The only way to change this is towards political approach. African states need stable institutions, efficient governance and fair justice system.Social:Risks:",310 followers,Alexander Von Stauffenberg,9,121,715.3K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

Phone calls, internet connections, software applications, banking, trading stocks -anything now done on a computer or smart phone will be done ""in your head."" Visualization will be accomplished by stimulus of the visual cortex, such that images are displayed inside the eye, but appear to ""float"" before the user, like the heads-up display used by a fighter pilot; an improvement on Google ""glass.""Storage and some processing will take place in a small appliance about the size of a deck of cards, carried in a pocket or in a small holster attached at any convenient place. It will communicate wirelessly with the headband. In addition, every user will be a ""hot spot"" to enable a massively redundant and universally accessible network. Portions of the brain itself will act as network attached storage. ""Forgetting"" will be a thing of the past, as the processor will catalog the content of human memory by constant scanning and analysis of the material as it may appear in conscious and subconscious thought patterns, dreaming, etc. Merely ""trying"" to remember will fire the neural network which will synchronize with device storage to tell you why you DID just walk into the kitchen.The concept of ""cloud"" computing will be replaced with ""fog"" computing, as we all operate more within the cloud itself, which is established by the network of devices in proximity to one another and with access nodes which are everywhere. In remote or isolated situations, the system will operate only within itself, whilst it constantly searches for signals.Bulk data streams (the internet, for example) will be distributed by light from LEDs which will be common sources of illumination everywhere. These will ""blink"" at a visually imperceptible rate so as to communicate data in much the same way as fibre optic cables. Want an internet connection? Turn on a light. See a demonstration here:Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi InternetSocial implications will be especially notable, because users may establish beacons to communicate their social status. Thus, for example, strangers in search of romance (for even just a few hours) might set a ""beacon"" to broadcast their availability, personal data, desires and intent automatically. Those doing so are alerted whenever a ""match"" occurs. This is already anticipated by apps such as ""Tinder,"" but a beacon will work automatically.Anonymity and security are based on a combination of DNA, a ""Passthought,"" a physical gesture and spoken word or phrase.Other current developments will blossom under this new technology. Uber, for example, may be summoned by simply ""thinking"" for a ride. The nearest available ride will be directed to you.The system will also allow for the elimination of credit cards and similar transaction mediums. PayPal (or its descendants) will capitalize on this. To buy anything, anywhere, just ""think it."" The money is transferred in real time. But such decisions will be coupled with a deliberate act to verify, such as recitation of a string of characters out loud or whistling a measure of notes.  At a physical store, buyers simply walk out with their merchandise in hand. ""Clerks"" merely standby to answer door alarms when any item not thought-bought passes through a detector.Systems will also scan user's biological and mental functioning so as to recommend meal choices, produce an alert if blood chemistry detects a problem or some other indicator suggests an intervention is in order. In emergency medical situations, the system will do a data dump to first responders to suggest what immediate medical treatment is recommended.More and more vehicular transportation will be self-working. People need no longer ""own"" cars, they simply have access to them by subscription. Need a van to carry goods and kids? Think for one. It will appear in a few minutes.And that's just for starters....","9,531 followers",John Geare,9,13.6K,48.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

This is a primary factor for futurists. Whilst such a high population may cause problems not seen before in human history, the ability to feed and hydrate such a population will actually increase beyond our current capability, which will result in a higher percentage of average wellbeing.Poverty as such will not be eradicated but many aspects about how we measure economic welfare will be adjusted. New measurements will take into account the balance of work injected vs salary garnered and not just salary. Poverty measurements will also include other socio economic elements such as available time. Today’s time-poor individuals will be classified as living in ‘poverty’ by 2050 standardised models.There will be an increase in overall globalisation. More individuals will be speaking English as their first language, and a much greater number than today will be speaking English as their second language. Estimates include that 70–80% of China will be fluent in English as a first or second language. Commonality of language improves international relationships and trade.A rise in education and literacy standards will improve the economies and the geo-political aspects of nations with high economic growth rates. There will be a new set of countries that will replace today’s BRIC countries as the ones to watch; Most of which will be in Africa with perhaps Peru being included.The UN may establish a second security council and label it something like “The UN Energy and Economic Security Council” which will have more member nations. Energy production will increase and solar energy will become the worlds primary energy source. The amount of regions in conflict will reduce though there will not be a complete absence of war.The nature of work will be impacted the most. What we do, the hours per day, the days per week will all change. The sense of a tangible global economy will emerge and the nature of people’s “energy” input and “value” output will drive completely new lifestyles. Countries with large amounts of land but with a small population like Canada, Australia, and Mongolia will adapt the quickest, and provide a model for others to replicate and improve upon. In many ways China has gone through this revolution since the mid-’90s. China and now many others will have to undergo this new change .The language of global software and hardware systems will become simplified to a point where most individuals will be able to manipulate parameters of systems to derive different and more customised outcomes. The idea of appliances will diminish as we move to an ecosystem of convergeable components.There will be a rise in global identity which will reduce the idea of nation-states. Existing large global “diasporas” will be a model for humans identifying themselves as global citizens whilst still embodying the history and traditions of their heritage and culture. The idea of multi-cultural cohabitation will find its way into even very small cities and townships all over the globe.Privatised space programs will become more commercially oriented as our sights turn to the Moon and the riches that can be found there. There will be at least a couple of automated mining & refining platforms sent to the moon and one or two of the larger asteroids. The first orbital hotel may be built by materials sent from the Moon as it would be more economical than lifting materials from Earth.General overall increases in wellbeing amongst the global population, coupled with the advancements made in medicine will see average life spans increase. Though the idea of living to 90 and even 100 will become more commonplace, there will not be an equivalent rise in people having great-grandchildren. Most diseases will either be cured or be clinically manageable. One area where there is expected to be a high amount of growth in preventative medicine research will be in the area of agriculture; enhancing the medicinal benefits of the food items in our diet, and bacteria; there will be a high degree of human designed good-bacteria that will maintain a highly efficient gastro-intestinal tract and integumentary system.All in all, a person born anywhere in the world today will have a high probability of being fluent in English, interacting with a large group of people all over the world, for professional and personal reasons, and by their mid-30s will have travelled to Africa at least once, will have done 10 different things as a source of income of which 3 will still be used, will be asked to perform tasks that are related to very large multi-generation projects like desert reclamation or orbital infrastructure construction for which the “reward” will be social credit that they will be able to pass on to their children or grandchildren. They will have the opportunity to explore more of the Earth, and even in a small city in the Amazon they will be able to find good Thai food.",200 followers,Eddie Cejvan,99,1.1K,954.9K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

The Soviet Union had a huge army which was not actually needed because at that time, the Soviet Union and the United States could destroy each other more than eight times over with the use of nuclear weapons. You don't need to destroy another country eight times over. This was a waste of resources.It also wasted a huge amount of resources on its foreign policy adventures, like in Afghanistan and many other places, while its economy at home was very ineffective.I think what President Putin meant was that the United States is also over-stretching its resources. It has a lot of unnecessary things that it pays for, for example, it has bases in many countries of the world. It also has a lot of problems at home. There is a very deep division between political camps in the US. What's more important is that the US is pursuing some policies which harm its economy in favor of ideology.The US is becoming increasingly ideological, just like the Soviet Union. The US now has this policy of fighting racism, which is not actually fighting racism but introducing reverse racism. In effect, there are already many rules in the United States where you give some quotas or privileges and employment for various groups of supposedly oppressed people, not on the basis of their merit, but on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. This is very like the Soviet Union, because in the Soviet Union, only there, during the time of my youth the privileges were given not on the basis of race, but on the basis of social background or ethnicity. If you want an effective economy, you need to hire people based on their merits, but not on other factors.I think what President Putin meant is not that the US is going to collapse very soon but that it has a lot of problems which, for ideological reasons, it is not even trying to address, and this reminds him of the Soviet Union.

It will still accept “normal” money but will also offer people a massive discount — 50% or more — for those using the cryptocurrency, and justify the discount based on using a blockchain (the technology behind the cryptocurrency) to reduce costs by 80 percent (if people use the cryptocurrency). It will offer its employees the option to collect salary in this cryptocurrency.The world will at first treat this decision as a funny experiment. The company will take a lot of heat.

When they need to purchase from this company, they’ll use the cryptocurrency — because they’ll save a lot of money. They will never convert that cryptocurrency into dollars or yen or euros (or whatever). The company’s employees will use this cryptocurrency to trade with people who buy this company’s products, or sell it to speculators at a premium — likewise never converting some portion of their income into dollars or yens or whatever their local currency is.Why is this a major event?Because other companies will follow. Individuals will follow. When you start a landscaping company, you’re not going to want to pay 3% plus fees to Visa or $2 per transaction to Square. Most small businesses and independent contractors can’t afford it now, much less in 10 years. Instead, you’re going to slap a QR code on your invoice and expect payment using your cryptocurrency, which you then exchange for whatever you want on an open market.As more people do this, the notion of using a government-backed currency will seem quaint and inconvenient. What will that mean for the role of central banks? Monetary policy? Banks? National currencies? Taxes? How will that change the way we pay each other? Charge each other?What will it mean when, instead of using government-backed currency, people start using a cryptocurrency that’s better than their government’s currency in every way?","3,425 followers",Mark Helfman,99,349,3.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

Cue a round of investment in smaller firms, most notably Amazon's Jeff Bezos backing General Fusion's attempts.2.With resources under pressure and key metals already scarce or uneconomical to extract, one solution is to reach for the stars. Planetary Resources wants to do just that – the first step in its hugely expensive, expansive plan is to begin what it calls the ARKYD Series of robotic space missions to identify the most commercially viable near-Earth asteroids.Precious metals and water – the latter crucial for the space missions themselves – are the prizes, though the very first mission involves the launch in two years of the ARKYD 'public space telescope' that will be used for myriad education purposes. However, its main task is to identify the closest asteroids worth mining.Seasteading is about creating experimental communities away from government control3.Just as the elevator made the vertical city possible, is living on water the next phase of urbanisation? It might have to be. With sea levels predicted to rise by 20-30cm by 2050, cities from New York and Bangkok to Guangzhou and Mumbai will experience increased flooding, while some island chains will be inundated, rendered uninhabitable. Could constructing floating communities be the answer?Cue the Floating City Project from the Seasteading Institute, a non-profit organisation that wants to establish floating cities primarily for experimentation beyond the restrictions of normal society. Designed to allow 'the next generation of pioneers to test new ideas for government', the organisation plans to approach governments of coastal nations to host an autonomous offshore community, or seastead.2050 will see a doubling in demand for electricity4.The smart gridGlobal energy consumption is increasing by about 2% ever year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which together with predicted population increase means a doubling of demand by 2050. Smart meters that communicate with smart grids are already popping up across the world, with fully automated smart grids eventually able to directly tie energy production to real-time demand.The end-game is a reduction in peak and off-peak production, partially by adjusting the cost of a kilowatt hour according to the time of day.There will be 100 million electric cars by 20505.At the heart of the drive to make grids more modern, smarter and better able to cope with increasing demand is the spectre of electric vehicles. If every driver in the UK will need to plug in their car each night – and perhaps even top-up during the day, too – the national grid is going to come under much more pressure than it does today.What's holding back the concept of electric vehicles is 'range anxiety', which comes from the core problem; battery technology badly needs some 'emerging technology', though Bosch thinks it's got the stop-gap sorted.Humans will need 80% more meat by 20506. Food of the futureWith the world's growing middle class already wanting to eat more meat, and with demand for flesh and protein expected to increase by as much as 80% by 2050, humanity's eating habits will have to change if we're to avoid a 'protein deficit' in the future.Cue cultured 'beef' burgers. The first example of in-vitro meat was made a few years ago from muscle cells taken from a cowGraphene could mean super-high buildings and even a space elevator7. GrapheneIt's been hailed as a miracle material. Discovered and produced by Konstantin Novoselow and Andre Geim at the University of Manchester in 2004 – who got a Nobel Prize for the trouble – graphene could mean super-efficient high-speed computing, flexible and super-thin gadgets, increased battery life by a factor of ten, and it could enable photovoltaic paint for solar power from any surface, and printable sensors along with tracking tags.Near-transparent sheets of carbon graphite molecules just one atom in thickness, graphene sheets are described as 'chicken wire made of carbon atoms' and are reckoned to be so strong that ribbons of graphene could enable super-high buildings – and even a space elevator.The Maglev will barrel along at 310mph8.Who wants mere bullet trains when you can have an ultra-high-speed superconducting 'floating' train system? Japan's JR Central train company is aiming to cut the journey time from Tokyo's Shinagawa Station to Nagoya in half by using its new magnetic levitation train.Powerful superconducting electromagnets above and below the track propel the train upwards (by about 10cm) and forwards, with the lack of friction meaning much faster speeds, even on steep slopes.Known as the L0 Series, it will travel at 310mph and connect the two cities in 40 minutes (it currently takes 90 minutes on a Shinkansen bullet train). It won't go into service until 2027, though there are plans to extend the line to Osaka by 2045.Get ready for green buildings that generate solar heat and collect water9.Buildings with integral trees and plants are the next big thing in architecture, and no vision of the world of the future is without skyscrapers draped in vegetation and rooftops thronged with trees.Milan's twin-tower Bosco Verticale is a real-life example of how peoples' desire to live in a dense urban environment and also be surrounded by vegetation can be achieved. Around 11,000 plants, 5,000 shrubs, and over 700 trees can be found within this revolutionary residential tower block, which architect Boeri Studio calls a ""device for the environmental survival of contemporary European cities"".Bosco Verticale is not just about reintroducing trees into urban settings. Recycled water is used to water the plants and trees, while the cladding of the building itself features integrated solar panels to provide energy.If it gets too crowded, the only option may be to bail on Planet Earth10.Electric propulsionMay saw arguably one of humanity's biggest tech breakthroughs when the Dawn probe reached the dwarf planet Ceres. Launched by NASA in 2007, Dawn is the first mission to use an electrically-powered ion engine rather than conventional chemical rockets.Its Xenon Ion Drive makes better use of fuel by accelerating it to a velocity ten times as fast as chemical rockets, which saves on mass. It's exactly this kind of (solar-powered) electric propulsion that will make long-distance space missions possible, but since xenon gas is massively scarce, the search is on for other propellants.

You're looking at a couple of challenges. I noticed that most of the answers here involve transplanting it to a new body, which adds some problems, and I also have to note that you didn't specify what quality of life this brain needs, or whether it must communicate with the outside world.But first, some background.I'm a neuroscience PhD student; I work mostly in electrophysiology with some computational stuff mixed in. And I regularly keep disembodied slices of mammalian brain tissue alive and signalling for hours. I'll describe that process, and then I'll discuss how this technique is adapted for whole brains.To keep extracted brain tissue alive means that I need to replace the body systems that kept the brain healthy in the first place. I mix up a solution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), which is essentially Gatorade. It's got replacement electrolytes in the correct concentrations, a couple of compounds to buffer the solution and control the pH, and some nutrients for those living cells. I also mix in some antioxidants because the brain has had rather a dramatic shock and needs to be protected while the neurons heal or at least recover. I could expand on this if you'd like.Next, I start a drip which allows the ACSF to flow across or through an interface chamber where it can bathe the brain tissue, and I turn on a heater which brings the fluid up to body temperature. I also bubble oxygen into the ACSF, plus blow additional humidified oxygen across the surface of the brain slice if part of it will be above solution for electrode recording. Between the ACSF, the heat, and oxygen, the brain is now receiving what it requires for survival. And the flow rate is sufficient to carry waste away; in most of my interface chambers the ACSF is not recycled and is just suctioned into a collection flask for disposal. There are many reasons for this but chief among them are because of potential contamination with bacteria or metabolic wastes, and also because this setup allows me to deliver drugs or toxins and then let them wash away. Also, the amounts of ACSF I use are trivial, perhaps two liters on a busy day. Hardly worth reclaiming.Anyhow, this works wonderfully for a slice of brain tissue and I can keep several of them alive and active for several hours at a time. But these slices are 200 to 400 micrometers thick, so vasculature is unnecessary. What about a whole brain?Enter Dr. Marco De Curtis. He has advanced a technique for extracting a whole brain and tapping into its internal vasculature by catheterizing the Circle of Willis. This is kind of a big deal because it gives us access to intact systems; if I recall correctly, he published a paper where they kept the olfactory system attached and were able to study scent recognition. But there are a couple of problems with his approach; the biggest problem is that it does not work in the most common disease models of mice and rats. It only works in guinea pigs.In fact, I work with a different rodent than any of those and it's an apt model for certain human diseases. A month ago my ""Principal Investigator"" (PI; aka lead researcher) noted that our animals have a substantially similar vasculature to guinea pigs. He injected dye into the vessels, emailed Dr. De Curtis, and was encouraged to continue. This is an ongoing project; we've been having a lot of trouble because the vessels are so darned small. Fine Science Tools should be delivering some equipment this afternoon and we'll take another tilt at this windmill tomorrow.So, to answer your question: Sure, a whole brain can be kept alive, at least potentially and with today's technology. It's mostly a matter of developing the existing techniques, and we're still working on it.As for how long it can be kept alive - conceivably, for a normal lifespan. The challenges would be the same as with any open surgical wound. You'd need to keep it sterile, moist, and with ample circulation. Forever is not an option at this point, because biology (or medicine, which is applied biology) still has not solved senescence. In other words, the brain will still get old. It might even age faster without sensory inputs, which neatly segues into the last point:Holy hell, man, this is a disturbing question. At this time we have nearly zero means of delivering sensory stimulus to a brain; at best, if you were to keep the optic and auditory nerves intact, you'd be able to use something like cochlear implants and the current generation of very rudimentary replacement retinas. Other sensory stuff - balance, proprioception, touch, temperature - we still cannot reproduce on any level that approaches meaningful input, at least not directly to the brain. Maybe if you kept the spinal cord attached.Outputs face even more drastic problems; Utah arrays do allow for controlling a robot arm or a computer cursor. But this is very limited, even with the current state of the art. Heck, I have a couple of Utah arrays in the other room and I know how much information they can carry; it isn't much compared to the rich data usually moving through our nervous system.You'd essentially be building a quadriplegic, except without even sensory input from the face via the cranial nerves which are usually intact after a spinal injury. This would be an extremely limited existence and, at the moment, horrifying to contemplate; in my opinion, even oblivion might be preferable. Imagine total locked-in syndrome, but worse.To make this a desirable therapy will require several technologies to mature and a whole lot of science to be coordinated and engineered.There's hope, though. Progress has been promising; if I had to pull a number out of the air, I'd say check back here in two decades. In the meantime, I'll keep working on my portion of the problem.",441 followers,Michael Zions,999,141,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-long-could-the-brain-survive-theoretically-if-we-had-the-technology-to-replace-all-other-body-parts-as-you-aged-with-functioning-organs-that-are-grown-in-a-lab-using-your-DNA

Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!","1,390 followers",Faisal Hourani,999,1.1K,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-long-could-the-brain-survive-theoretically-if-we-had-the-technology-to-replace-all-other-body-parts-as-you-aged-with-functioning-organs-that-are-grown-in-a-lab-using-your-DNA

Oxygen is just one component that the brain needs to function properly.If the body is no more, you need something to mimic the functions that it performs. Essentially, in order for the brain to survive outside the body, it would need to be in an incubator, something that perfectly mimics the functions of the body. This incubator would need to mimic the heart by pumping blood to the brain through the arterial system and remove it through the venous system, all the while maintaining the proper blood pressure for appropriate situations. It would need to mimic the function of the kidneys by filtering blood and removing wastes. It would need to mimic the function of the digestive system by injecting vital nutrients into it. And perhaps most importantly, it would need to mimic the respiratory system by oxygenating blood and removing carbon dioxide. If any of these systems don't work properly the brain will likely die.As you might imagine, we don't have the technology to do such a thing at this point in time. It would be a momentous task to remove the brain in the first place without severe damage, nevermind keeping the brain alive for an extended period. That being said, at some point in the future it will probably be possible.

Freud explained it as being similar to a steam engine (1). As recently as a century ago it was thought to be a telephone-switching style network, a battery, and now, thanks to the current paradigm, a digital computer.What's more likley: People 100 years from now will look back amazed that we finally got it right, or look at our assumptions with the same level of amusement and chuckle at how shortsighted we are?Perhaps we're the lucky generation that happens to live in the era when we finally got the metaphor right. Maybe computing power really is all it takes to simulate consciousness. There is a good case to be made for this.Computing PowerScott Aaronson, a respected theoretical computer scientist at MIT, made an interesting observation about the potential for the artificial development of consciousness through computing:""Because the brain exists inside the universe, and because computers can simulate the entire universe given enough power, your entire brain can be simulated in a computer.""""And because it can be simulated in a computer, its structure and functions, including your consciousness, must be entirely logical and computational."" (2)This does seem to make sense, and it implies that if you don't believe consciousness requires supernatural elements, you must conclude it can be replicated in a computer - in theory.Though Aaronson's statement seems to sneak in a crafty assumption, that the theoretical computer can simulate the entire universe. How do we know this? Isn't it possible the universe may contain elements that cause computation problems?For instance, dividing by zero, or any calculation involving infinity creates a multitude of computation issues. And yet, the universe is full of such things that have zero size and infinite density, otherwise known as black holes.Testing for ConsciousnessMaybe we're really putting the cart before the horse here. We really ought to be asking if its even possible to test for consciousness, and if so, how? If we can't find an objective way to determine consciousnesses, then what's the point of trying?A machine merely telling us it feels conscious is meaningless - how hard would it be to program such a thing. Even the Turing Test only accounts for our perception of intelligence, not actual consciousness.(3). It seems we really need something more meaningful and objective.American philosopher John Searle provides an interesting perspective on this:""Suppose we discover that there are very specific brain processes that cause consciousness - so that, for example, in brain-damaged patients we can re-introduce consciousness by artificially producing certain kinds of brain mechanisms. To give these mechanisms a label, let's just call them XYZ: it's XYZ that causes consciousness.""""Now we go down the phylogenetic scale and we discover, no question, that dogs and cats and primates all have XYZ; but when we get very low we discover that termites have XYZ but snails don't. Then we'd have to say, 'Well, OK, snails are conscious and termites are not'"" (4)On this basis, there is at least hope for a methodology that we can offer judgment on whether we've succeeded. We'd then need only duplicate the brain processes described above in digital format to achieve our goal.This would not only make the approach much more efficient, but also adds a real sense of ob...",109 followers,Todd William,99,148,482K,https://www.quora.com/How-long-could-the-brain-survive-theoretically-if-we-had-the-technology-to-replace-all-other-body-parts-as-you-aged-with-functioning-organs-that-are-grown-in-a-lab-using-your-DNA

I also follow this closely.

127,"The entire brain, thinking is what the brain does.What you are asking for is basically for the entire neurology to be explained here.Let's start from the broadest, there are two types of brain matter: white and grey. Grey matter is the end of the neuronal circuits, it's the most exterior layers of the brain (for the most part, there's grey matter in many other areas), where the information goes from merely being transported to being processed through the patterns of signaling of the grey matter cells.The entire brain, thinking is what the brain does.What you are asking for is basically for the entire neurology to be explained here.Let's start from the broadest, there are two types of brain matter: white and grey. Grey matter is the end of the neuronal circuits, it's the most exterior layers of the brain (for the most part, there's grey matter in many other areas), where the information goes from merely being transported to being processed through the patterns of signaling of the grey matter cells.There are also glial cells that feed the neurons and clean the space between them where they release neurotransmitters after the impulse is duely passed, they also recycle the used transmitters to form a new transmitter again. If we go by that, glial cells are a part of the brain without involvement in thinking, but the thing is glial cells also transmit impulses on occasions, and they are definitely key for the neurons to do their job.Now on a more anatomical sense the brain is divided in parts (they come from the 5 folds that form when you are an embryo). They are 5 parts of the encephalus (what many people call brain), more primitive to more developed as you get from caudal (down) to craneal (up). Humans stand out for the size and prominence of theIn the telencephalon the grey matter is on the surface as I said before, and that means thatAnyway, the telencephalon forms the prosencephalon along the diencephalon, then there's the mesencephalon alone, and the metencephalon and myelencephalon forming the rhomboncephalon.If you know some Greek those names make a lot more senseAll of those parts have some white and grey matter, but the telencephalon is the one with most of it.It is divided in two hemispheres, the right and left hemispheres, only connected by the Corpus Callosus (a small curved “rectangle"" in between both hemispheres with fibres crossing to each other). There are also fibres connecting different parts of the same hemisphere called association fibres, and then there are the radiated fibres coming from the diencephalon bringing information from the senses and other grey matter areas in other parts of the brain. These fibres exist because thought needs the interaction of various parts of the brain. I am going to say parts of the brain focused in one function, but many interact in almost any thought for one reason or the other.Each hemisphere is divided in 4 lobesAnd it is covered in those surface foldings I mentioned before to increase the surface of grey matter without increasing the size of the head, these foldings will be calledFRONTAL LOBEThe frontal lobe is the centre of planning, designing, judgement, will, abstract thought (the one typical of philosophy), abstract emotions, personality… it is by far the lobe that “upgrades"" the most between other primates and humans in term of size, it is the lobe behind the forehead, all our prominent homo sapiens foreheads that set us apart from more primitive hominids are containing this lobe.The frontal lobe is what makes animals more social or our social interactions more complex, it is what makes us sense justice and abstract ideas, to be existential and emotionally complex, to create plans in order to achieve things and to design tools, to judge others and ourselves, to see right and wrong, imagination, playfulness, boredom…The prefrontal cortex contains all those functions there are other functions in other areas of the frontal lobe that I will explain later after the other lobes.PARIETAL LOBEThe parietal lobe is a “perception"" lobe, it processes touch, touch patterns, understanding and putting information together. For example when you grab a spoon you can put together that it is a spoon without seeing it thanks to the parietal lobe sensory association areas.In some areas of the lobe the perception functions become a lot more abstract, but I will also explain it at the end.TEMPORAL LOBEThe temporal lobe compiles the information from the sounds and smell, it manages memories and emotions linked to memory and senses (sound, smell). They aren't abstract emotions in the same way as the frontal lobe, they are more primitive emotions processed in the temporal pole. Memories are stored in the subcentral gyrus (of this lobe obviously).I would summarise it as theAgain, I will talk about other parts of the lobe at the end.OCCIPITAL LOBEThe occipital lobe compiles information from the vision and allows to recognise what you see from visual memories also stored in t, and imagine things in space, it is the one with visual thought.This one is probably the most exclusive lobe in terms of function, it is just vision,BIG SULCIRemember the sulci dividing these lobes? They also have very important functions,Silvio Sulcus between the temporal and frontal lobe and some of the parietal lobe is the one thatThe Central Sulcus dividing the parietal from the frontal is the one that concentrates all the connexions with the body (limbs, torax etc)It divides the parietal and the occipital lobe and has some important areas.SULCI'S BORDERING AREASLocated in the frontal lobe bordering the Central Sulcus with the Parietal Lobe on the other side until an opening between both lobes separating the Central Sulcus from Silvio Sulcus.The precentral gyrus processes movement, the central sulcus is the one connecting the cortex with the information from the body and the frontal lobe is the doing lobe, so what it does is process the movement of the body. The precentral gyrus has all the parts of the body orderly placed along the gyrus and it starts the order for any (willing) movement. There is an association area right ventral (forth) of it which allows for more complex movement orders.Located in the parietal lobe on the other side of the Central Sulcus, the parietal lobe was the perception lobe remember? So what does the perception lobe do in the Sulcus with all the connections to the body? It processes the sensations from all the body.And exactly like the precentral gyrus it also has each part of the body orderly process by a specific set of neurons. When you lose s limb this gyrus re-organises over time and those neurons start processing other parts of your body you still have, the same as in the frontal lobe counterpart for movement.Just as I said in the parietal lobe already, there are association areas further dorsal (back) that allow for more complex and integrated sensation processing (the spoon example).It is located in the opening between the parietal and frontal lobe right on top of Silvio Sulcus.You remember Silvio Sulcus processed language, and the temporal lobe's side bordering Silvio Sulcus processed hearing right? Well the frontal lobe side bordering Silvio processes speaking, because it also reaches to the precentral gyrus right on top of it, for movement. So placed between Silvio (with hearing) and movement it is the perfect location for speech cognitive functions, right next to the tongue and mouth movement.And the upper part of the Broca Area is the one processing writing, as it is closer to the hand movement parcel of the precentral gyrus.Someone with Broca damaged won't be able to talk, he will be anle to understand language and have ideas to express but he won't be able to produce language, he can move the mouth, throat and tongue, just not to make language. He won't be able to move the mouthLocated opposite sides of the opening, on the parietal lobe (perception lobe), you have the same, the mouth and tongue sensory parcel of the postcentral gyrus, and right “south""of it (meh, caudal for doctors) you have an area that processes taste.This one was allegedly Einstein's big difference with an average brain, this one and the following area I will explain.Wernicke is located in the temporal lobe, at the end of Silvio Sulcus bordering the parietal lobe.It relates to audition areas and complex integration areas of the parietal lobe, so can you guess what those two things render? Language understanding cognition. The way concepts (through language) are perceived, understood and integrated. If you have a damage in this area you will be able to ramble all sort of nonsense but you will understand nothing, you will talk and talk without coherence “the table my sun opened the chicken regardlessly"", that's what a patient with this area damaged does. He can talk because Broca still does the job, but he cannot make sense of it.It is right next to Wernicke in the parietal lobe, it's the other of Einstein's allegedly over-sized parts.It is in the parietal lobe and it is a complex information integration area, it is the one that does maths, arithmetics, algebra or logic sequences (chess for instance). It also borders the occipital lobe as it is located immediately dorsal (back) to Wernicke, it is no longer in Silvio Sulcus but in the end of the Parieto-occipital Sulcus. It also integrates visual information, it is more visual than Wernicke's audition-linguistic focus, it processes spacial thought.It is located right “north of"" (craneal) Wernicke, on the parietal lobe between the Angular Gyrus and the Taste Area over Silvio Sulcus.This one focuses on learning processes, the ways to annalyse knowledge and the systems acquired to learn it, also self/world perception, that is ego versus empathy. The importance to your problems versus others'.BASAL GANGLIAMoving out of the cortex and the visible parts of the telencephalon, further deep you have the Basal Ganglia, separated by the Cingular Gyrus on top and the External Capsule(s) on the sides, the Basal Ganglia are 3 (2), there's the Caudate Nucleus which is “headphone”-shaped (one of those for telephone operators) deeper within the brain, one on each side; it is connected by a series of striations with the Putamen, which is an “oval ball"" located beneath and to the sides of the Caudate. To the sides of the Putamen there is the Globus Pallidum, a rounded white-ish sphere.They are 2 anatomically: the Caudate Nucleus and the Lentiform Nucleus (Putamen + Globus) and they are 2 in terms of function and origin: the Globus Pallidus and the Nucleus Striatum (the Caudate + Putamen with theThese Basal Ganglia are a support for movement coordination and organising the information going to the lobes, they have close connections with the Thalamus already in the Diencephalon and with the Sustantia Nigra. They stimulate and de-stimulate areas of the brain and each other in order to “refine"" movement orders and in-coming information, their damage causes shaking when starting a movement, for instance when moving the arm to grab something, someone with the Basal Ganglia damaged will shake when he/she starts moving the arm. This is opposite of the Cerebelus which I won't include because it's not part of the Telencephalon, but the Cerebelus also has a movement coordination function and when it is damaged it's the last part of the movement that fails: instead of grabbing the object you may throw it away unwillingly because your hand shakes as it approaches the aim. Similarly Parkinson Syndrome known for causing uncontrolled constant shaking is a degenerative disease of the Sustantia Nigra, closely linked to the Striatum through the Nigro-striatal fibres.There's the Internal Capsule on the medial (inner) part of the Basal Ganglia, between them and the Thalamus, the information from the rest of the brain and the rest of the body crosses to the cortex in fibres organised in a certain way here (which I won't include), like I won't include the specific stimulation and destimulation circuits of the Basal Ganglia.

What you're experiencing is age-related changes in the way your brain works. And in many ways it's actually working better. Studies have shown that older people have better judgment, are better at making rational decisions, and are better able to screen out negativity than their juniors.The brain compensates for a slower processing speed by using more of itself.MRIs taken of a teenager working through a problem show a lot of activity on one side of the prefrontal cortex, the region we use for conscious reasoning. In middle age, the other side of the brain begins to pitch in a little. In seniors, both sides of the brain are sharing the task equally.A host of studies in the last decade have shown that the more mature brain actually has advantages over its younger counterpart. For example, in a study of air traffic controllers and airline pilots, those between ages 50 and 69 took longer than those under 50 to master new equipment, but once they had, they made fewer mistakes using it.

Hemodialysis replaces kidney function in patients with end-stage renal failure. Insulin pumps take over partial pancreatic function by managing insulin secretion in patients with type I diabetes. Ventilators pump air into and out of the lungs in patients with respiratory failure.But consider an organ such as the liver. How are you going to replace something so complex?! You need something that detoxifies and metabolizes hundreds of different substances, stores and produces glycogen, makes albumin and other serum proteins, creates and processes lipoproteins, etc. There is no way a machine can do all that…yet.It's also much easier to replace certain organs with donor tissue which you know will function similar to the original.You can transplant the following organs:And the following tissue:You can also replace important GI flora (bacteria) using a procedure called a fecal transplant.

138,"Powerful Technological Innovations That Could Change Your Life“Powerful Technological Innovations That Could Change Your Life“Similarly, the advent of chat bots has helped us resolve our queries and problems easily. People resort to virtual assistants rather than calling or submitting forms, which would have been quite time-consuming.Now we are almost halfway through 2019. Thus, it is time for us to analyse the tech innovations that would take the world by storm in the year 2020. I have crafted the list of top 8 tech trends that would change our lifestyle in 2020.1.Did you know that almost 49% of consumers rely on mobile phones for shopping? 61% of the consumers in the US use their mobile phones to compare prices of different products in the brick and mortar stores. Over 61 million people in the United States have been reported to be using mobile payments. Considering all these statistics, it is safe to say that mobile commerce will successfully edge into our lives by the year 2020.Most of the people use apps and mobile friendly websites for shopping on their mobile devices. The best thing about mobile payments is that you can pay for products without the requirement of in-hand cash. You can pay for the products or services through Apply Pay and Google Pay. China has already introduced WeChat and Alipay for online transactions. Even panhandlers tend to opt for this system of transactions since it has made life simpler for many.2. AI as a serviceAlexa and Siri are nothing but the amazing products of AI technology. It is needless to say that these tech innovations have made things easier for millions of people. Companies have already started to streamline their business operations and improve their customer experience through the use of AI. The thing is that designing AI-based systems requires a great deal of money for most of the businesses. Thus, 2020 will find most of the AI applications in the form of service platforms.We can find such AI-as-a-service system on the platforms of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These usually consist of an expensive custom engineering technique which lets us use these websites easily. The AI makes it possible for us to look for specific categories among the multiple products on Amazon. We can even type the name of our desired product and get access to all the similar products within a matter of seconds. By 2020, we can expect different organisations to adopt this AI-as-a-service system and provide ore tailored applications to consumers.3. AutomationAutomation has made it possible for organisations to get time-consuming and mundane tasks over with easily. Organisations have been able to maximize their productivity and increase production rates due to automation. Human effort may lead to high-end quality workmanship. But, the automated systems tend to perform the same activity with less variability. This results in consistent product quality and greater control of the product quality. The automated systems also help the organisations make the most of raw materials thereby giving rise to comparatively less scarp in 2019.We can expect the automation to take over most of the industries including banking and pharmacies. It will decrease human effort considerably along with other production costs. Thus, automation will also maximize the profit potential for most of the companies. The combination of AI and automation has already started to create business opportunities in multiple fields. By 2020, automation will create enough jobs with high wages for workers from all over the world. In that case, the workers would have to acquire new skills to match pace with the advanced machines.4. 5G network5G network will make our lives easier and faster. From the possibility of enhancing self-driving cars to running entire smart cities, 5G is most certainly the Next Big Thing in the generation of tech innovations. 5G is definitely like a boon for those people who are always looking for more speed, more features and more storage space. 5G has already been introduced to the 7 additional cities by the AT&T. It is expected to dominate the entire world by the year 2020. 5G is expected to provide speed of up to 5 gigabytes per second. It is at least 250 times more than the normal transmission speed.By 2020, 5G is all set to change the way we live, see, work, communicate and travel. We will be able to see and ride the self-driving cars and transfer videos or movies in just a short time span. Whether you have to upload5. Autonomous drivingElon Musk, the chief of Tesla, an automobile company recently said that he expects his company to come up with a successful autonomous vehicle by this year. Tesla also aims at designing vehicles that are capable of operating with a lesser degree of autonomy. Thus, the autonomous cars would consist of features such as the automated braking and lane changing. The autonomous driving technology also claims to improve the security and entertainment functions of the car. We can expect the automated cars to be more dependent on analytics and data capture.Simply put, these autonomous cars will redefine the automobile industry to a huge extent. Apart from cars, other vehicles such as trucking and shipping would become more autonomous. We can expect breakthroughs in the automobile industry throughout 2020. Waymo just finished a trial of autonomous vehicles in California which transported more than 10,000 people. Let’s just hope that 2020 could be a witness to an amazing technology such as autonomous cars.6. Prescriptive analyticsThese days, businesses are susceptible to a flood of data due to the organisational supply chain. Thus, the companies tend to turn to analytics solutions to identify the meaning or purpose of the huge piles of data and improve their decision making techniques. The world has already been exposed to the descriptive analytics, which uses data mining and data aggregation to summarize the raw data. These analytics helped people learn from their past behaviors and determine how they could impact the future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics lets us use simulation algorithms and optimization to determine the possible outcomes.Descriptive analytics answers the question “What has happened?” Prescriptive analytics answers the question “What should we do?” Predictive analytics estimates the chances of a future outcome. Companies can use this strategy to forecast what can happen in the future. The foundation of predictive analytics is based on probabilities. This analytics will identify specific patters in the data and implement statistical models and algorithms to determine the relationships between different sets of data.7. Predictive and personalized medicineTechnology has been influencing the healthcare industry at an unprecedented rate. As I mentioned before, 5G would help us fetch data from wearable devices like smartwatches. This feature will help us predict and treat our health issues with the utmost precision. The technology would be designed in such a way that the wearable would be able to keep track of the person’s basic health status. You will be notified about your health risks even if your body hasn’t shown any relevant symptoms. Even doctors would also be able to prescribe medicine through a data-driven understanding of how the medicine would be fruitful for a specific patient.You can expect to get a glimpse of more personalized approaches when it comes to treatment. This can also be termed as precision medicine which lets doctors apply the right treatment through relevant data analytics. Owing to the modern advancements in technology in the field of AI and genomics, doctors will have a deeper understanding of how our bodies work. We will also be able to understand if our bodies are equipped enough to fight off specific diseases. The bottom line is that 2020 is the time for predictive healthcare and effective personalized treatments.8. Bitcoin and blockchainCryptocurrency and blockchain are two of the most common topics of technology.Block chain technology is the digital ledger that has been preserved in a distributed network. This technology lets you distribute the network without copying it. The best thing about block chain technology is that it does not involve any centralized authority. Thus, fraudsters will not be able to alter the transactions. Nobody will be able to keep track on your online transactions. Thus, block chain technology is one of the safest options for people out there. Most importantly, you can enjoy the ownership of your own data by the year 2020.All in all, we can expect innumerable changes in technology by 2020. We have already been exposed to some innovations right from 2019. Now is the time for us to just wait for the innovations in the next year.",1 follower,Abhishek Mitra,9,431,376.7K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025

The basic idea is that actors in a system are grouped into batches, and the speed of their movement is carefully controlled to move them more efficiently through a space. a sensor-equipped car would need to communicate its trajectory—right, left, or straight—to a central algorithm controlling the intersection, which would group it into a “batch” of other cars going in the same direction. Second, the central software system would need to be able to control the speed of each platoon, using cruise control-style software that already exists in most cars, to limit the speed of your car as it moved through the intersection.ADVANCED AUGMENTED REALITY AND POWERFUL AIAn advanced VR and AR will be developed by 2023 that will analyze crime scene investigations with powerful algorithms to identify and derive possible scenarios and suspects involved within a crime scene. Massive online databases can be accessed in the field, to compare any relevant findings. Facial recognition, combined with online criminal records, allows full instant profiles to be generated on a suspect through an officer's augmented field of vision. New AI programs can identify any suspicious behavior or familiar faces.Fully Autonomous Driverless VehiclesFully automated cars are expected to contribute some 13.7 billion U.S. dollars by 2030 in terms of research testing and development.

The question, ‘what’s next’ is a constant in a tech geek’s professional life. When it comes to technology, there is always something fresh and the hunt to develop and implement a new technology that could augment businesses is unyielding. The inquisitiveness to know and seek knowledge about the technology and how it is going to impact the daily lives of the human species.Technology is true, one of the greatest change agents in the present world, and is moving faster than ever before. It has the supremacy to offer innovative solutions to global challenges. The emerging technologies have brought a radical shift in the information, technology and development sector and thereby impacting the other industries along with sales and marketing business segments well. Mapping the imminent technology proposal of the business demands the business leaders to first identify these emerging technology trends. They ought to learn the dynamics of the technology and how it would impact the present and the future of the business.Here are some of the most revolutionary and disruptive emerging technologies:Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have taken huge leaps in the recent past few years. For example, a business can apply machine learning and offer the consumer a fresh purchasing option, depending on the analysis of the history of the purchasing pattern and taste of the consumer. Machine Learning could be an effective tool for cyber financial frauds. Artificial Intelligence could be a more robust system to combat the new complex cyber-attacks. The ML and AI technologies blend a variety of other skills and expertise such as neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing. This also includes other statistical concepts to appreciate, learn, forecast, acclimate and potentially function autonomously.Internet of Things (IoT)IoT is seen as the change agent for the luxurious and effective lifestyle for the consumers, offering valuable customer interactions and exceptional experiences for them. IoT is one of the most exciting areas of focus today. The idea revolves around the nano-sensors circulating in the human body or any specific object. Once connected with the technology, this is going to have a proliferating impact on the various sectors such as medicine, agriculture, architecture etc.Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain Technology is the disruptor of the Financial Industry. Mostly espoused by the cryptocurrency industry, today, even the conventional banks have started to clout its usage. The rise of bitcoin industry has raised the ambiguous inquisitiveness of the blockchain technology affecting the emerging markets. The blockchain technology is a digital principled ledger which creates numerous chained blocks of data and ensures sales and marketing resources are focused on the numbers of the business.Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)The fascinating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is the current catchphrase of every technocrat. The AR and VR are potentially remodelling the way consumers interact with each other and the technology, inspiring the growth of pervasive settings. For instance, AR allows the user to blend the real and virtual world. With the help of VR technology, firms can deploy virtual business training and remote involvement. . The technology is also helpful to know in-depth about the changing tastes of the target audience and has immense potential to influence the business strategies.Big DataBig data technology is a very simple and effective concept. An exceptional method to collect, organise and comprehend the data for the benefit of the business. The quantitative output of data-driven analysis is one of the core strengths of big data technology. The Big data technology involves building huge data architectures to organise and analyze the unstructured data and offer real-time value for the business. The vast augmentation of the digital data has enabled not just big, but also the small and medium enterprises to disrupt the power of big-data. This technology with the right expertise would help the business to lower the cost of consumer gaining, augment sales and step into new business markets.Market AutomationEvery entrepreneur and business tycoon must be aware that marketing automation is here to stay. In the present-day scenario, sales and marketing personnel must automate processes in every way possible to offer the best experiences for the consumers. Businesses must leverage the benefits of this exclusive technology to eradicate the human-exclusive tasks. A robust automation tool is tailored to the explicit requirements of the business.The online e-commerce leverages the best of automation technology. An e-commerce industry can use automation technology to understand the customer’s buying cycle and share the right message at the right time. For example, if he or she has left the shopping cart without making a purchase.Cloud ComputingThe market forecast states that in the next five years, 50% of the business organisations and global companies are moving their data to the cloud. This also points that Cloud Computing Technology companies such as Microsoft have greater responsibility to safeguard and secure the consumer valuable data. In the healthcare sector, operations and medical organisations can maintain the patient data, check the status of the patient and offer necessary treatments as and when necessary, without storing the data in the hardcopy of files.Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",UNKNOWN,Al Klein,9,84.3K,60.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025

To operate efficiently, you’ll need well-curated and timely operations.In a recent study, an estimated $3 trillion goes down the drain annually due to bad data. Therefore, it’s quite imperative that you address this problem early as a company. Luckily, CDPs help to solve this problem by collecting data from all sources. They then organize it, tag it, and make it usable.Device Form FactorsThe current customer needs include small, light, and effective devices. Therefore, manufacturers are heading to the call by providing hybrid devices that double up as phones and tablets. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 does this quite well. 2021 will see a return of stronger and more efficient folding and unfolding devices.Quantum ComputingQuantum computing has helped in the management of COVID-19 in terms of managing the spread, looking for possible vaccines, and the development of therapeutics.

It also enables employees anywhere in addition to enabling the deployment of business services across distributed infrastructure.Internet of Behaviors(IoB)IoB is an upcoming trend that you’ll hear more of in 2021. Companies and businesses are taking advantage of technology to monitor consumer and customer behaviors. Some of the effective technological tools here include location tracking big data and facial recognition.According to a prediction by Gartner, more than half of the global population will be under an IoB tool by 2025.Total ExperienceOften abbreviated as TX, the total experience goes side by side with the customer experience, user experience, and employee experience. As most of the interactions today are virtual, distributed, and mobile, it’s important to use the TX strategy even more.Already, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a new norm in collaborations. And that’s why you need to bring together the customers and employees. Intelligent Composable BusinessThis trend focuses on taking advantage of packaged business capabilities. You can develop it through vendors or do it in-house. ICB helps to bring different things together, including better access to changing data, better decision making, and application delivery.Hybrid CloudMost businesses are moving towards the hybrid cloud model. The reason is simple – the hybrid cloud is more convenient. It helps businesses to strike a balance for their distinct cloud infrastructural needs.Most of the giant public cloud providers have started focusing on the hybrid cloud. Some of them include Google Cloud,Oracle, and IBM. All of this aims at dealing with different customer challenges including:Privacy and Confidential ComputingIt involves the encryption of the entire computing process and not only the data. This creates extra layers of security that help to protect sensitive information. We should expect more of privacy and confidential computing in action come 2021.Smart Work from Home TechnologiesThe coronavirus pandemic has shifted the way we do things and carry out business. Initially, it would be radical to allow employees to work from home on a large scale. Even when employees were asking for enhanced work flexibility, it was never to be.The current lockdowns have led to the common acceptance of the work from home formulas. And many pundits argue that this work-from-home policy will outlast the pandemic. We have seen many tech giants extending the work from home flexibility to their staff. Some like Twitter have even given their employees the option of working from home entirely for the rest of their working careers.Part of what made all this a reality is the deployment of smart work from home tools such as WebEx, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. Such apps have witnessed massive usage over the past few months, and this is expected to continue even in 2021.Artificial IntelligenceAI has continued to improve operations for many companies and businesses. The pandemic even made its usage more common. AI, data, and machine learning have played an unmatched role during this coronavirus period.We have seen how AI has helped in the suggestions customers get when shopping on Amazon, or even when they are watching movies on Netflix. More companies will benefit from AI since the cloud continues to enable access to the rising computing power, software, and frameworks. It’s estimated that 45% of companies using artificial intelligence have increased their total spend per customer, and their ASPs.Hope you like Article.",176 followers,Zisis Kontogounis,0,3.8K,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025

More efficient methods to power those cities are becoming a necessity, particularly solar energy.Solar alone can meet our energy needs. In fact, to address today's global demand for energy, 25 solar super sites -- each consisting of 36 square miles -- could be erected.

The ultimate integration may be brain-machine interfaces that eventually allow people with spinal cord injuries to live normal livesToday we have mind-controlled video games and wheelchairs, software by Intel that can scan the brain and tell what you are thinking and tools that can actually predict what you are going to do before you do it.No. 10: Humans or Borg?According to Stephen Hawking, ""Humans are entering a stage of self-designed evolution."" Taking the medical technology idea to the next level, healthy humans will be given the tools to augment themselves.While the early use of these technologies will be to repair unhealthy tissue or fix the consequences of brain injury, eventually designer enhancements will be available to all.Ultimately, humans will use so much technology to mend, improve or enhance our bodies, that we will become the Borg. Futurist Ray Kurzweil is pioneering this idea with a concept he calls singularity, the point at which man and machine merge and become a new species. (Kurzweil says this will happen by 2054).

I won’t go into them in detail, but suffice it say, all web pages—even this one—use some HTML and CSS. They’re not programming languages, but they’re necessary technologies for today’s webby world.JavaScript is a disaster. It is a programming language, but it’s a horrid mess. Despite this, some people love it. Most OO programmers, like yours truly, see it as a disaster of syntax, design and obfuscation.But, unfortunately, it’s necessary. It’s the only way to make web pages suitably responsive. It runs in the browser and is the only language that does so.Because it’s such a nightmare, many “frameworks” have sprung up to try and make it more manageable. Some of these include:And some frameworks use other frameworks. For example, Angular uses another framework called jQuery (though some might call jQuery a library).You’ll most likely use a framework of some kind, and React and Angular are currently two of the most popular.For the backend, you have a wide choice of languages and technologies. They all have pros and cons, but I won’t go into exhaustive detail. In truth, almost any general purpose programming language can be used on the backend, but some are far more popular than others.JavaThis is one of the most popular backend languages. Like most other backend technologies, it’s contacted by the JavaScript on the web page to do it’s magic.It’s not very sexy, but it is sane, reliable and stable. If you write a program in Java today, you don’t have to worry about it breaking two years down the road when a new version of Java comes out.Because of it’s stability and easy readability—and strong OO support—Java is used by some of the biggest technology firms around the world for their backend operations. It’s also cross-platform, so it can be hosted on almost any flavor of Linux, Unix or Windows servers.C#A close but spiteful cousin of Java, C# shares nearly all the benefits of Java (reliable, very OO, stable, etc.), but it’s actually a little bit better. Its main drawback is that until recently, it wasn’t very cross-platform.Microsoft, the original creator of C#, is taking great strides to correct this oversight and is releasing a version of the .NET framework—called .NET Core—to all major operating systems. C# systems using .NET Core will run on nearly any major operating system today.It’s probably for this reason that C# is finally being adopted by the bigger technology companies such as Google as an acceptable development language.In short, your life will be easier with C# compared to Java, but just make sure you use .NET Core when developing your C# system (at least if cross-platform operation is important to you).C++C++ is probably a poor choice forAnd while it can be cross-platform, it isn’t guaranteed to be. A C++ program written for Windows probablyMany large tech companies use C++ on the backend, but only in conjunction with one of the two previous technologies—Java or C#—for time-critical operations.I would only look at using C++ for operations that have been found to be too slow with Java or C#, but those operations are quickly disappearing as Java and C# get faster.JavaScriptWhy anyone would want to use this disaster on the back end is beyond me, but some people really love it. The biggest JavaScript system for backend operations is Node.js.The biggest pro for Node.js is that you can use JavaScript. If you like JavaScript, well you can use it on the backend too.The biggest con is the same: it’s freaking JavaScript. If you hate JavaScript, well, you can hate it on your backend as well.PythonFor all but the smallest websites and operations, I’d avoid Python. While it’s super easy to create a backend because of Python’s “batteries included”, scaling up Python isn’t easy.For example, I wrote an entire website in 17 lines of Python code using Flask. It didn’t do much, but it was an entire website with REST endpoints and rendered pages. But scaling that up to an entire web application on the scale of, say, Google Contacts would be a huge challenge.Scaling isn’t Python’s strong point. For that, you’d want to use something like Java or C#. Both can scale much easier than Python.But Python could be ideal forWell…?What would I use for a web app? Probably:Hope this helps.

The device uses infrared to see in the dark at night when the floodlight is off.From a design perspective, the Presence looks more like a standard issue outdoor flood light than a security camera, which is a good way to trick any would-be wrongdoers. I'm not in love with the design, which is a little blocky for my taste, though ultimately the minimal aluminum build is pretty inoffensive. It's rated IP66 to withstand harsh outdoor conditions, like ice, rain, sun, and wind.The camera records full HD 1080p video. It has a 100-degree field of view, and a very impressive 65-foot detection range (many outdoor cameras provide a range closer to 25 feet). There's also infrared night vision, and Netatmo uses end-to-end encryption to make sure no one else can access your camera feed.Check out :Storage -Hybrid cloud storageIt is a combination of public cloud storage and private cloud storage where some critical data resides in the enterprise's private cloud while other data is stored and accessible from a public cloud storage provider started byWith hybrid cloud storage, enterprises are able to mix and match cloud storage resources between local data center infrastructure and scalable, on-demand infrastructure, with the cloud storage provider typically fully managing the cloud storage.Hybrid cloud storage combines the advantages of scalability, reliability, rapid deployment and potential cost savings of public cloud storage with the security and full control of private cloud storage.Hybrid cloud storage more accurately means using on-premise storage and storage in the public cloud to create a greater overall value – as a kind of mash-up. You could have some data on one and some on the other, depending on its risk classification or its latency and bandwidth needs.

Each has desktop, smartphone, home automation, some variation of cloud storage, etc.One weak area for Google is full-scale desktop hardware - something that Apple excels at, and Microsoft is entering with its Surface Studio line. It’s considered a “declining market”, but I predict demand will increase as the smartphone market becomes more saturated.Today’s Chromebooks are tiny little 11″ to 14″ laptops, but I propose that Google make a 27″ to 35″ one-piece desktop Chromebook, with a HighDef 4k to 6k display, and power it with an Intel i7 and 16 to 32 Gigs of RAM and a 250 Gig SSD HDD.The concept behind this machine is simple: today’s desktop office worker spends most of their time on web applications, so why not improve on the already successful Chromebook model by putting it into a high-power chassis that would compete with high-end machines?Office productivity software would default to Google Apps or G Suite, butCurrently there are about 3 million business and 70 million educationalThe main selling points of this device are reliability and price. Reliability because Chromebook is built on a stable Linux kernel with a minimum of software, and doesn’t require antivirus, defrag, or the other rot that plagues Windows.From a price perspective, if a 27″ iMac starts at $1,999 with an i7 proc, then Google could undercut the price and sell it for $1,000 to $2,000 (the less expensive price might require a 1-year G Suite contract or existing G Suite license for discount).",3 followers,Robert Zaripo,9,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-emerging-technologies-in-software-industry

For example, the Internet will become available to residents of remote cities, and medicine will be able to fight rare genetic diseases.1.

Forbes writes about it.New technologies, which MIT specialists spoke about, will change not only the daily life of people, but also the way they communicate. For example, the Internet will become available to residents of remote cities, and medicine will be able to fight rare genetic diseases.1. Mega-constellations of satellitesThe main goal of creating satellite mega-constellations is the desire of people to provide high-speed Internet access in all corners of the planet. The development and launch of such satellites is engaged, for example, by Elon Musk's Starlink company .2. Pocket Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence technologies will become even more accessible to ordinary users in 2020. The smartphone will remain the main guide to the world of AI technologies, primarily due to smart applications.3. Artificial intelligence in microbiologyArtificial intelligence isn't just used for entertainment. With its help, doctors and biologists create new drugs and antibiotics, thanks to which it becomes possible to treat rare diseases. The use of AI technologies in medicine is significantly reducing costs in the industry.4. Quantum computersLast fall, Google officially announced its ""quantum supremacy"". However, the company admitted that while their technology is capable of performing only one calculation, and the use of quantum machines for solving ordinary problems remains in the distant future. But development continues and quantum reality is not far off.5. Forecasting climate changeThe increase in computing power has led to the fact that today humanity is better able to predict climate change and their consequences. These technologies will only develop. Over time, people will be able to better understand how to save the Earth and improve the ecological situation.6. Anti-aging drugsMedicine today deals not only with the treatment of the main "" diseases of the century "" such as cancer and heart pathologies. Doctors are also working on anti-aging drugs and life-extension technologies. Already, many of them are being successfully tested on humans.7. Safe InternetThe trend of the future is quantum networks. They are much more secure, and the information in them is better encrypted. So far, the quantum Internet remains the technology of the future, but developments in this area are being actively pursued today.8. Digital moneyDigitalization of currencies will only develop. Already, a huge number of people almost (or not at all) do not use paper money. Banking technology allows instant transactions and guarantees greater privacy and security.9. Hyperpersonalized medicineMedicines will adapt to the needs of each individual patient. This primarily concerns the treatment of rare genetic diseases. Hyper-personalized medicine will bring hope to many who suffer from incurable diseases.10. Differential PrivacyDifferential privacy will be used in 2020 during the US Census. This method allows you to collect a lot of information about specific people, but for specialists they will be impersonal.

Both technologies need one scientific breakthrough and then a bunch of engineering.

Humanity will launch the first interstellar probes and generally begin considering interstellar travel.There will be a small colony on Mars similar to today's on Antarctica, mostly for research, and to satisfy the human desire to explore. You'll be able to visit, but the price will be incredible and few people will do so.AI will be roughly as smart as humans, and robots will do most of the jobs humans do today. Most things will be very cheap, but only high end engineers and artists will be able to find work. A basic income policy will have been introduced long before, and it will support most of the population. By 50 years from now this will seem perfectly normal.

We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend. Your help with makeup and photography was an absolute godsend — thank you so much. I love and appreciate you. P.S. you took over 300 pictures in an eight hour span. Thank you from the bottom of my heart:)Brooke — Even with a bullet hole in the head, you are deliciously gorgeous.

309,"In 10–30 years the world would be much different.Technology:In 10–30 years the world would be much different.Technology:Genetics will improve and medicine will advance tremendously in a way life expectancy will grow dramatically.Climate change:A. Technologically, companies will continue to develop clean forms of energy despite the fact low oil and coal price. Companies such as Tesla will become new Exxon Mobile or Ford. Private citizens will act in order to support companies to develop clean energy through crowdfunding which will be one perhaps the most used form of finance.These efforts will be directed to India whereaprox. 300 million people will move from rural areas to urban, Brazil, South Africa, the United States, Russia (or what will be there after Russia), China (a lot of small regions, not today’s China).The idea is that in the next 10 years people and companies will act with visionary politicians such as Modi, Peña Nieto, Macron, Trudeau to promote clean energy around the globe.Geopolitics:Russia will collapse in the same way the Soviet Union collapsed. USSR collapsed when their defense budget was highly increased and when oil price was low. Now, in 2017 we have exact the same conditions. After all, Vladimir Putin is in charge since 2000. The last generation doesn’t know another political leader than Putin. They will act in the same way Egyptian people acted in 2011. Yes, there will be a Russian Spring, not in 10 years but in less than 3. In 10 years there will be a lot of small states.China will implode in a less centralized government. The gap between regions and rich-poor people is too high to be ignored. Chinese regions will act independently according to their economic interests.Japan may solve its demographic crisis using robots for manufacturing. Immigrants will not invade Japan in the next 10 years. Japan will reconquer its lost territories from Russia and will dominate China once again.With a low oil price, Saudi Arabia will no longer exist as a state. They currently implemented Strategy 2030, a national strategy to diversify Saudi economy. But because of its religious influence and social structure, it is too late to act. A good example in diversifying an oil based economy is the United Arab Emirates that will become a financial hub, an educational world center and perhaps a technological power.South America will grow if it will remain stable. This region will develop tremendously. With a lack of external threats and lack of internal rivalry, those countries will form an effective economic bloc. The new generation of politicians will fight against corruption and organized crime. In the next 10–30 years we will talk about “The Mexican Model” which will be exported to Central and South America. Current Mexican president is a reformist who is fighting to stabilize the country and eliminate drug cartels. Mexico has an enormous potential to develop due to its ocean coastlines, natural resources, and workforce.The United States has to turn back being the world leader. Trump’s approach on international relation is very similar to China foreign policy: bilateral negotiations, zero-sum game, isolationism. I expect only 4 years of Trump, then I expect a left-wing president such as Bernie Sanders. The reason is young people are involved in the social debate and they are willing to promote the values such as universal free education and healthcare, equality of chances. In the same way, the future generation of European will act to establish a fiscal union, in the US next generation will act to introduce free access to education and healthcare. Due to the technological and financial development, we could expect a success.African continent will transform itself dramatically. Countries such as Nigeria will become the new china while Chinese provinces will develop themselves in the same way Japan did. Africa is very unpredictable because of its lack of political institutions. The political risk of investment in Africa is too high now. The only way to change this is towards political approach. African states need stable institutions, efficient governance and fair justice system.Social:Risks:",310 followers,Alexander Von Stauffenberg,9,121,715.3K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

But one sized for direct implant will be on the drawing boards and in testing. Any desired task will be engaged by ""thinking it,"" such as, ""Call Mary."" Phone calls, internet connections, software applications, banking, trading stocks -anything now done on a computer or smart phone will be done ""in your head."" Visualization will be accomplished by stimulus of the visual cortex, such that images are displayed inside the eye, but appear to ""float"" before the user, like the heads-up display used by a fighter pilot; an improvement on Google ""glass.""Storage and some processing will take place in a small appliance about the size of a deck of cards, carried in a pocket or in a small holster attached at any convenient place. It will communicate wirelessly with the headband. In addition, every user will be a ""hot spot"" to enable a massively redundant and universally accessible network. Portions of the brain itself will act as network attached storage. ""Forgetting"" will be a thing of the past, as the processor will catalog the content of human memory by constant scanning and analysis of the material as it may appear in conscious and subconscious thought patterns, dreaming, etc. Merely ""trying"" to remember will fire the neural network which will synchronize with device storage to tell you why you DID just walk into the kitchen.The concept of ""cloud"" computing will be replaced with ""fog"" computing, as we all operate more within the cloud itself, which is established by the network of devices in proximity to one another and with access nodes which are everywhere. In remote or isolated situations, the system will operate only within itself, whilst it constantly searches for signals.Bulk data streams (the internet, for example) will be distributed by light from LEDs which will be common sources of illumination everywhere. These will ""blink"" at a visually imperceptible rate so as to communicate data in much the same way as fibre optic cables. Want an internet connection? Turn on a light. See a demonstration here:Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi InternetSocial implications will be especially notable, because users may establish beacons to communicate their social status. Thus, for example, strangers in search of romance (for even just a few hours) might set a ""beacon"" to broadcast their availability, personal data, desires and intent automatically. Those doing so are alerted whenever a ""match"" occurs. This is already anticipated by apps such as ""Tinder,"" but a beacon will work automatically.Anonymity and security are based on a combination of DNA, a ""Passthought,"" a physical gesture and spoken word or phrase.Other current developments will blossom under this new technology. Uber, for example, may be summoned by simply ""thinking"" for a ride. The nearest available ride will be directed to you.The system will also allow for the elimination of credit cards and similar transaction mediums. PayPal (or its descendants) will capitalize on this. To buy anything, anywhere, just ""think it."" The money is transferred in real time. But such decisions will be coupled with a deliberate act to verify, such as recitation of a string of characters out loud or whistling a measure of notes.  At a physical store, buyers simply walk out with their merchandise in hand. ""Clerks"" merely standby to answer door alarms when any item not thought-bought passes through a detector.Systems will also scan user's biological and mental functioning so as to recommend meal choices, produce an alert if blood chemistry detects a problem or some other indicator suggests an intervention is in order. In emergency medical situations, the system will do a data dump to first responders to suggest what immediate medical treatment is recommended.More and more vehicular transportation will be self-working. People need no longer ""own"" cars, they simply have access to them by subscription. Need a van to carry goods and kids? Think for one.

312,"In some ways it will be similar to the world we are in now, and of course nothing is certain but the following view stems from a high probability calculation:There will be ~9.5B people living on Earth. This is a primary factor for futurists. Whilst such a high population may cause problems not seen before in human history, the ability to feed and hydrate such a population will actually increase beyond our current capability, which will result in a higher percentage of average wellbeing.Poverty as such will not be eradicated but many aspects about how we measure economic welfare will be adjusteIn some ways it will be similar to the world we are in now, and of course nothing is certain but the following view stems from a high probability calculation:There will be ~9.5B people living on Earth. This is a primary factor for futurists. Whilst such a high population may cause problems not seen before in human history, the ability to feed and hydrate such a population will actually increase beyond our current capability, which will result in a higher percentage of average wellbeing.Poverty as such will not be eradicated but many aspects about how we measure economic welfare will be adjusted. New measurements will take into account the balance of work injected vs salary garnered and not just salary. Poverty measurements will also include other socio economic elements such as available time. Today’s time-poor individuals will be classified as living in ‘poverty’ by 2050 standardised models.There will be an increase in overall globalisation. More individuals will be speaking English as their first language, and a much greater number than today will be speaking English as their second language. Estimates include that 70–80% of China will be fluent in English as a first or second language. Commonality of language improves international relationships and trade.A rise in education and literacy standards will improve the economies and the geo-political aspects of nations with high economic growth rates. There will be a new set of countries that will replace today’s BRIC countries as the ones to watch; Most of which will be in Africa with perhaps Peru being included.The UN may establish a second security council and label it something like “The UN Energy and Economic Security Council” which will have more member nations. Energy production will increase and solar energy will become the worlds primary energy source. The amount of regions in conflict will reduce though there will not be a complete absence of war.The nature of work will be impacted the most. What we do, the hours per day, the days per week will all change. The sense of a tangible global economy will emerge and the nature of people’s “energy” input and “value” output will drive completely new lifestyles. Countries with large amounts of land but with a small population like Canada, Australia, and Mongolia will adapt the quickest, and provide a model for others to replicate and improve upon. In many ways China has gone through this revolution since the mid-’90s. China and now many others will have to undergo this new change .The language of global software and hardware systems will become simplified to a point where most individuals will be able to manipulate parameters of systems to derive different and more customised outcomes. The idea of appliances will diminish as we move to an ecosystem of convergeable components.There will be a rise in global identity which will reduce the idea of nation-states. Existing large global “diasporas” will be a model for humans identifying themselves as global citizens whilst still embodying the history and traditions of their heritage and culture. The idea of multi-cultural cohabitation will find its way into even very small cities and townships all over the globe.Privatised space programs will become more commercially oriented as our sights turn to the Moon and the riches that can be found there. There will be at least a couple of automated mining & refining platforms sent to the moon and one or two of the larger asteroids. The first orbital hotel may be built by materials sent from the Moon as it would be more economical than lifting materials from Earth.General overall increases in wellbeing amongst the global population, coupled with the advancements made in medicine will see average life spans increase. Though the idea of living to 90 and even 100 will become more commonplace, there will not be an equivalent rise in people having great-grandchildren. Most diseases will either be cured or be clinically manageable. One area where there is expected to be a high amount of growth in preventative medicine research will be in the area of agriculture; enhancing the medicinal benefits of the food items in our diet, and bacteria; there will be a high degree of human designed good-bacteria that will maintain a highly efficient gastro-intestinal tract and integumentary system.All in all, a person born anywhere in the world today will have a high probability of being fluent in English, interacting with a large group of people all over the world, for professional and personal reasons, and by their mid-30s will have travelled to Africa at least once, will have done 10 different things as a source of income of which 3 will still be used, will be asked to perform tasks that are related to very large multi-generation projects like desert reclamation or orbital infrastructure construction for which the “reward” will be social credit that they will be able to pass on to their children or grandchildren. They will have the opportunity to explore more of the Earth, and even in a small city in the Amazon they will be able to find good Thai food.",200 followers,Eddie Cejvan,99,1.1K,954.9K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

The Soviet Union had a huge army which was not actually needed because at that time, the Soviet Union and the United States could destroy each other more than eight times over with the use of nuclear weapons. You don't need to destroy another country eight times over. This was a waste of resources.It also wasted a huge amount of resources on its foreign policy adventures, like in Afghanistan and many other places, while its economy at home was very ineffective.I think what President Putin meant was that the United States is also over-stretching its resources. It has a lot of unnecessary things that it pays for, for example, it has bases in many countries of the world. It also has a lot of problems at home. There is a very deep division between political camps in the US. What's more important is that the US is pursuing some policies which harm its economy in favor of ideology.The US is becoming increasingly ideological, just like the Soviet Union. The US now has this policy of fighting racism, which is not actually fighting racism but introducing reverse racism. In effect, there are already many rules in the United States where you give some quotas or privileges and employment for various groups of supposedly oppressed people, not on the basis of their merit, but on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. This is very like the Soviet Union, because in the Soviet Union, only there, during the time of my youth the privileges were given not on the basis of race, but on the basis of social background or ethnicity. If you want an effective economy, you need to hire people based on their merits, but not on other factors.I think what President Putin meant is not that the US is going to collapse very soon but that it has a lot of problems which, for ideological reasons, it is not even trying to address, and this reminds him of the Soviet Union.

Cue a round of investment in smaller firms, most notably Amazon's Jeff Bezos backing General Fusion's attempts.2.With resources under pressure and key metals already scarce or uneconomical to extract, one solution is to reach for the stars. Planetary Resources wants to do just that – the first step in its hugely expensive, expansive plan is to begin what it calls the ARKYD Series of robotic space missions to identify the most commercially viable near-Earth asteroids.Precious metals and water – the latter crucial for the space missions themselves – are the prizes, though the very first mission involves the launch in two years of the ARKYD 'public space telescope' that will be used for myriad education purposes. However, its main task is to identify the closest asteroids worth mining.Seasteading is about creating experimental communities away from government control3.Just as the elevator made the vertical city possible, is living on water the next phase of urbanisation? It might have to be. With sea levels predicted to rise by 20-30cm by 2050, cities from New York and Bangkok to Guangzhou and Mumbai will experience increased flooding, while some island chains will be inundated, rendered uninhabitable. Could constructing floating communities be the answer?Cue the Floating City Project from the Seasteading Institute, a non-profit organisation that wants to establish floating cities primarily for experimentation beyond the restrictions of normal society. Designed to allow 'the next generation of pioneers to test new ideas for government', the organisation plans to approach governments of coastal nations to host an autonomous offshore community, or seastead.2050 will see a doubling in demand for electricity4.The smart gridGlobal energy consumption is increasing by about 2% ever year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which together with predicted population increase means a doubling of demand by 2050. Smart meters that communicate with smart grids are already popping up across the world, with fully automated smart grids eventually able to directly tie energy production to real-time demand.The end-game is a reduction in peak and off-peak production, partially by adjusting the cost of a kilowatt hour according to the time of day.There will be 100 million electric cars by 20505.At the heart of the drive to make grids more modern, smarter and better able to cope with increasing demand is the spectre of electric vehicles. If every driver in the UK will need to plug in their car each night – and perhaps even top-up during the day, too – the national grid is going to come under much more pressure than it does today.What's holding back the concept of electric vehicles is 'range anxiety', which comes from the core problem; battery technology badly needs some 'emerging technology', though Bosch thinks it's got the stop-gap sorted.Humans will need 80% more meat by 20506.

Discovered and produced by Konstantin Novoselow and Andre Geim at the University of Manchester in 2004 – who got a Nobel Prize for the trouble – graphene could mean super-efficient high-speed computing, flexible and super-thin gadgets, increased battery life by a factor of ten, and it could enable photovoltaic paint for solar power from any surface, and printable sensors along with tracking tags.Near-transparent sheets of carbon graphite molecules just one atom in thickness, graphene sheets are described as 'chicken wire made of carbon atoms' and are reckoned to be so strong that ribbons of graphene could enable super-high buildings – and even a space elevator.The Maglev will barrel along at 310mph8.Who wants mere bullet trains when you can have an ultra-high-speed superconducting 'floating' train system? Japan's JR Central train company is aiming to cut the journey time from Tokyo's Shinagawa Station to Nagoya in half by using its new magnetic levitation train.Powerful superconducting electromagnets above and below the track propel the train upwards (by about 10cm) and forwards, with the lack of friction meaning much faster speeds, even on steep slopes.Known as the L0 Series, it will travel at 310mph and connect the two cities in 40 minutes (it currently takes 90 minutes on a Shinkansen bullet train). It won't go into service until 2027, though there are plans to extend the line to Osaka by 2045.Get ready for green buildings that generate solar heat and collect water9.Buildings with integral trees and plants are the next big thing in architecture, and no vision of the world of the future is without skyscrapers draped in vegetation and rooftops thronged with trees.Milan's twin-tower Bosco Verticale is a real-life example of how peoples' desire to live in a dense urban environment and also be surrounded by vegetation can be achieved. Around 11,000 plants, 5,000 shrubs, and over 700 trees can be found within this revolutionary residential tower block, which architect Boeri Studio calls a ""device for the environmental survival of contemporary European cities"".Bosco Verticale is not just about reintroducing trees into urban settings. Recycled water is used to water the plants and trees, while the cladding of the building itself features integrated solar panels to provide energy.If it gets too crowded, the only option may be to bail on Planet Earth10.Electric propulsionMay saw arguably one of humanity's biggest tech breakthroughs when the Dawn probe reached the dwarf planet Ceres. Launched by NASA in 2007, Dawn is the first mission to use an electrically-powered ion engine rather than conventional chemical rockets.Its Xenon Ion Drive makes better use of fuel by accelerating it to a velocity ten times as fast as chemical rockets, which saves on mass. It's exactly this kind of (solar-powered) electric propulsion that will make long-distance space missions possible, but since xenon gas is massively scarce, the search is on for other propellants. Cue missions to Mars, and a potential way off our increasingly crowded planet.",206 followers,Abhishek Purohit,9,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

The current human primate is a clever bipedal.The next technology will be the controlled use of the time-space continuum.

It has progressed from non-existent to metal wires, to light in glass wires, and today we have electro-motive force.The change will be into non-linear telephony transmission outside of the limits of time-space continuum technology that really-primitive-humans primates invented about 22,000 years ago. Telephony will become a nonverbal technology, free from the techniques of the language, civilization, sin, time, and distance. All of which were invented by primitive-humans within the last 6,000 years.The new telephonic system is still in the R&D stage in scientific technology. It is used experimentally in mainstream technology of civilization. Telephonic communication is a common occurrence and considered a normal-natural part of life. For lack of a “name,” it is like telepathy, metaphysics, religion, dreams. Black holes, folds in space, parallel universes are the conduits or wires of communication.Telephony will be able to allow future-human-primates to communicate with “Understanding.” Fire and Electromotive force will be with Understanding.",420 followers,Kenneth Archer,9,4.4K,2M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

I haveHello Ryan, My Centrifugal Propeller (CP) is getting next to no attention. This is amazing considering the impact that it will have on the evolution of mankind.This new technology will put us into space like we see in sci-fi. I have a working proof of concept prototype and in June 2018, I took it to my nation’s capital, Ottawa, to meet with two government officials. One of these guys is a smart fellow with 4 degrees, two of which are in physics and in engineering. After seeing the prototype and the explanation of its principle, he kept repeating, “You are going to win the Nobel Prize”. I have started to think that it won’t happen in my lifetime, because everyone is totally ignoring this. I have gone to media and aerospace companies, through the internet and by phone, to tell them about this new technology. They totally ignore me to the point of not even returning my emails or phone calls.This new technology will replace all rockets, jet engines, air and marine propellers and even many commercial lifting devices and even create lifting devices for domestic use.In space it will continually accelerate so you will have gravity in your spacecraft while accelerating. Then at the halfway point of the journey you turn the spacecraft around and re-engage the CP to decelerate, and you have gravity again in your spacecraft. It means that people will be leaving for day shifts mining on the moon and return home for supper on the same day. A trip to Mars will be little more than a day-trip.I have some very smart people telling me that this will make me a billionaire, but unless the CP starts getting some attention soon, it may not happen in my lifetime.I have had a lot of abuse from people who have not even seen the invention and yet feel compelled to throw their insults at me. After one of these abusive types actually saw the working prototype, he just went away, silent. No acknowledgement, no compliment, nothing. Others say that you cannot create thrust in a completely closed unit because it goes against Newton’s 3rd Law. Well it doesn’t go against it, it just expands it. Newton did not take into consideration the potential of redirecting reaction in multiple directions at a right angle to the initial action. It is so simple. And that is what I have done with centrifugal force.The uses of this invention are too numerous to list them all, but here are a few: farm seeders and harvesters will be able to hover over wet fields, allowing the crops to be seeded and harvested when traditional equipment would get bogged down. That will extend the growing seasons up to two months in some areas.Imagine wheel chairs that can fly up stairs, cars that hover over roads and water. Initially they will probably have altitude/height governors on them even though the CP will be capable of unlimited altitudes. Otherwise people would be killing themselves going outside of breathable atmosphere.Submarines that can travel at 100 Mph. All marine craft will have the CP inside of their hulls, eliminating the need to remove the propeller shaft and replace the seals annually. Nothing will extend outside of the hull. That will be a huge cost saving.The cost of infrastructure will drop because there will be limited costs to maintain roads or even have bridges. There are some asteroids in the asteroid belt that have trillions of dollars worth of metals. Those can be brought to Earth within a day or two.On construction sites you will be able to strap a CP onto something heavy like a bundle of drywall, and just float it into the area where it is needed.Please understand, the CP is not an energy generator. Think of it this way: you take a propeller off of an airplane and replace it with a CP. The gas motor still turns the CP. The big difference is that it is far more efficient and quiet. The plane will go way faster and the only noise will be the internal combustion engine turning the CP.In space it will be powered by an electric motor that will be powered by a small nuclear reactor. The kind that CANDU Reactors makes (about the size of the average bathroom) would be perfect. A suitcase sized amount of fuel will power it for years. You could also use batteries/capacitors and solar panels to power it.The uses for this new technology are limitless. And yet, no one will take me seriously unless I force my way in front of them and give them a demonstration. That is not always possible nor desirable.I have been posting on boards like this for years, trying to get the attention of people who could use this technology and take it to the next level. Mostly, all I get is criticism from small minded people who refuse to do some investigating into this. I have invested almost a million Cdn into this. Now it seems that I will have to build more than just a proof of concept prototype, I will have to build an actual working, practical prototype. More of my personal money. Unbelievable. What is really unbelievable is just how obtuse the masses have been about this. This is something that I am prepared to show anyone, and I am prepared to discuss, debate, whatever, with anyone. The more of my own money that I have to put into this, the more expensive it is going to be to invest in or even be an end user of.It is inevitable that this technology will be generally accepted.

The sun creates two main types of energy – light and heat – that can be harnessed for many activities ranging from photosynthesis in plants to creating electricity with photovoltaic (PV) cells to heating water and food. PV or photovoltaic power or CSP otherwise known as concentrated solar power which is used for solar heating.For most of human existence, the cooking of food was unknown. Food was eaten in the condition it was found- often raw and spoiled. Through trial and error, humans found that fire could be controlled and used to cook food, as it is essentially solar power stored in the form of wood. Considered in this manner, solar was the first method of cooking on earth.The beginnings of solar cooking, can be traced to several isolated instances in the distant past. The Essenes, an early sect of Jews, gently heated wafers of ground sprouted grains on rocks heated by the desert sun.Solar Cooker TechnologiesIn time, others turned towards solar cookers. The “hot box"" style solar cooker created by Horase de Saussure, a Swiss Naturalist in 1776, was capable of reaching temperatures of about 190 degrees and used in cooking fruits.In India, a British soldier patented a fairly sophisticated solar cooker that looked a lot like the solar chef, which is described below.Today's solar cookers began evolving in the 1950's.History of solar cookingOne of those global problems was the growth of deserts around arid communities. The United Nations and other major funding agencies initiated many studies to design solar cookers that could alleviate some of the reliance on plant life for fuel. Many top engineers of the 1950's were hired to study different aspects of solar cooking designs.The UN then sponsored studies and programs to introduce these cookers into cultures where the need was most apparent.The study did reveal one success. In a northern Mexican community lacking fuelwood, they found that the cookers were still in use five years later. this showed that it was possible to get cookers out to people in need.Cabrito in South TexasPiercing rays of light beamed down on the Chilean village of Villaseca as Luisa Ogalde placed a pot filled withIn another box nearby Ogalde placed rice, which she said would take 40 minutes to cook, and dough, which would need about an hour to become bread.Restobar Solar Entre Cordillera (The owner and executive chef at Restobar Solar Between Cordillera, which opened in 2018, relies upon a set of eight boxes, solar ovens that work by heating meat the same way a parked car heats a human on a hot summer day.Ogalde uses the solar ovens to make other traditional stews, including beef- or chicken-based""We're rescuing all of the old recipes of the area and giving value to the homestyle foods of our grandparents,"" she explained.Yet, while the recipes may be old, the way of cooking them is brand new- a unique melding of past and present.Chile's sun-baked Atacama Desert is known as the driest place on Earth (Ogalde belongs to a generation of cooks who have opened solar restaurants in remote parts of Chile's sun-baked Atacama Desert, which begins just north of Villaseca, ends at the Peruvian border and is known as the driest place on Earth.In a growing trend, increasing numbers of chefs across northern Chile are using solar ovens to cook traditional foods (The movement began decades earlier when Francisca Carrasco (Ogalde's mother), a goat farmer in Villaseca, became a solar cooking pioneer.The goal of the study was twofold. Researchers wanted to help families in this isolated patch of the Elqui Valley to rise out of poverty with a free source of energy, but they also wanted to find a way for them to cook without deforesting the few remaining algarrobo, churqui and carboncillo trees for their traditional wood-burning stoves.Naked Albizia TreeVillaseca transformed into the first village and eventually centralized starting point in Chile to use solar power for cooking, opening countless possibilities.At first it was just people cooking for their families, but foreign tourists began to arrive in greater numbers, asking to see those who cooked with the sun. Over time, participating families made key observations that helped them perfect this new style of cooking. The parabolic solar cookers, they noticed, concentrated heat extremely fast and were a great replacement for things you'd normally do on a stovetop, such as boiling water. Meanwhile, the box-like ovens could both slow-cook stews and replicate a traditional oven for baking bread and deserts.Delicias del SolIn 2000, the association opened its first solar restaurant, Delicias del Sol, with capacity for 24 guests.Qori Inti: El renacer pandémico del restaurant que cocina con la energía del sol - La TerceraIn the tiny desert oasis of Pica, on the far northern end of the Atacama, Ruth Moscoso runs the solar restaurant Qori Inti, which means ""radiant sun"" in her native Aymara language.""In our culture we have a strong environmental awareness,"" Moscoso said. ""So, we said, let's do something that takes into consideration our traditions and our customs of caring for Mother Earth, but also our tradition of being thrifty and optimising what we already have here, which is sun and heat. So, it's really a convergence of tradition and innovation.""The vast majority of Moscoso's ingredients come from her network of local Aymara peopleEating Traditional FoodMoscoso is now innovating again with a special type of solar oven that cooks food inside a glass evacuated tube, which absorbs sunlight and turns it into heat to quickly bake or roast items normally cooked in a traditional oven.-However, one significant difference with this particular style of cooker is that it does not have a real large coking interior compared to that of a box style or panel style solar cooker and regular pots and pans cannot be used at all in this kind of cooker.GoSun Stove Evacuated Tube Design Solar CookerWith the help of a regional grant for small businesses, she purchased six of these solar cookers earlier this yearIn the Chilean capital Santiago, new startup Antu Cocina Solar is launching a similar tube-style solar cooker developed under a circular economy model that benefits both users and the environment by turning plastic waste into a pollution-free appliance for everyday cooking.Clearly, the importance of solar heating and cooking has been overlooked in the archaeological record. In modern times,, solar cooking has remained an under utilized source of energy favored by necessity in the past. Chefs, restaurant owners and those barely eeking out a living highlight the importance solar energy as a renewable source of energy in harsh, fringe and war-torn environments . The recent popularity of solar heating and cooking technologies must seem comical to those who have relied upon them for millennia.","10,694 followers",Colleen Anne Coyle,999,418,16.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technologies-that-people-dont-know-about-yet

Usually you have to either hold down F2, press enter 10 times, do a backflip, to the right now y'all, one hop this time, and it will enter recovery mode. This is mainly for trying to restore Windows to a previous version, or recovering information if the computer breaks.Remember that, too.Lesson 3: When you use Windows, even if you don't have to enter a password, you are signed in as a user. Each user has specific access rights and privileges. For example, Administrators usually have more access to system files and settings than regular users do.Ok, so here's where I got in trouble.I'd come into the computer lab during lunch to dink around, play flash games, etc. because I didn't have a computer at home. Eventually, I got my hands on a flash drive that I downloaded games like Goat Simulator and Gmod and the like during lunch breaks. The problem was: I was a student, and the student accounts on the computers were not able to run programs directly off of removable media. So, in order to play my games, I'd have to copy the files over to the computer and run them from there. The other problem was: the school computers had Deep Freeze installed on them, so I'd have to copy them back if I wanted to save my progress.That copying/pasting took way too long.So I thought,But Deep Freeze will revert any changes made to specified drives on the computer whenever they're rebooted, which happened automatically every night. So I could either disable the automatic rebooting and risk some dumb kid turning my computer off accidentally, or I could disable Deep Freeze.*cracks knuckles*I tried deleting the program files for it, but it wouldn't let me. I did some research, and this is where I learned Lesson 3. So I made myself the owner of the Deep Freeze folders, then deleted them.Nice.Except, when I went back to school the next day, it was back.This is where I learned Lesson 2. It was a bit more difficult on the school computers, but I was able to get the computer I was on into recovery mode. Since the “user” that accesses system files in recovery mode is technically the computer itself, it had permission to make any changes it wants. I tried deleting Deep Freeze from here, hoping it wouldn't be reinstalled the next day. Sadly, it was.…Now I did not come to this next conclusion on my own (I think I followed some long-lost YouTube tutorial). But I did figure out how to implement it in this specific situation.When the computer is in recovery mode, since it's mostly there in case of emergency, most Windows features are stripped away (like the basic file explorer), and you're basically left with nothing but a command line. But a command line is a very powerful tool, if you know the commands.Since I didn't have a file explorer, and trying to open one just opened another command line, I opened notepad. Then, I pressed “File”, then hit “Open”.Boom. File explorer. But what good is a file explorer, you ask?To which I reply:With the computer under the assumption that I was trying to open a text file, I navigated to the System32 folder and located sethc.exe, and renamed it to something else (I think it was sethcq.exe or something).

I renamed cmd (2).exe to sethc.exe.Now we're cooking with grease.I rebooted the computer, and since Deep Freeze didn't see anything wrong, nothing was reverted. On the login screen for the computer, before I was even logged in, I press Shift 5 times, and a command line comes up.Success!Using that command line, I made myself a full admin and gave myself full rights to everything. Then I deleted Deep Freeze.Next day, it's back on.I came to find out that there was a program running on a network drive that would reinstall Deep Freeze if it was uninstalled. I didn't even have permission to give myself permission to edit those files, so it seemed like I was stuck. I was an admin on this computer, but I didn't have the login for the network drive.Then it hit me: the computer has to be connected to the network drive in order for the network drive to make any changes. I couldn't disconnect the drive from the computer, butI still didn't have the login for the drive, so what I did is (and keep in mind, I've been doing all this in chunks of 45 minute lunch breaks) I downloaded a full, clean .iso of Windows, burned it to my flash drive (which meant I had to delete all my games, rip. But it's for the greater good), and booted the computer from the flash drive instead of the hard drive. I reinstalled Windows on the hard drive, and voila!The teacher came out, and I was instantly banned from the computer lab.Lesson 4: don't get caught :PEdit:So a lot of the comments suggest I should've just installed my own OS on the flash drive, and they're right. I just didn't think of doing that.

You’re far more likely to be injured or dieMany will like to point out that the spent nuclear fuel will be radioactive for thousands of years. That’s because the nuclear reactors commonly in use today only use about 5% of the available energy during their 18 month operation time. Yes, nuclear power plants are typically refueled every year and a half. Once they’re refueled they just run. Many plants operate for 98% or more time producing electricity, shutting down only to be refueled (when extensive inspections and necessary maintenance take place). Modern monitoring systems can detect radiation at a far lower level than would pose any danger to life, and extensive reporting helps insure proper management of the plants.However, as good as the current “fleet” of nuclear power plants is, there are far more advanced reactor designs in existence. Many of them can even use the spent fuel from the existing power plants, taking a waste resource and putting it to good use. Small, modular reactors promise to lower costs by allowing for assembly line production of the plants. And fuel is not only abundant, it is for all practical purposes unlimited, as there are new ways ofIn a day when we want to move transportation to electric vehicles, increase electricity consumption despite efficiency gains, and reduce our carbon footprint, nuclear not only makes sense, it is essential.Safety of Nuclear Reactors",UNKNOWN,Kody C.

Rich said to the engineers gathered round that “anything you can imagine, we can already do”. This is an extraordinary statement coming from a person in charge of top-secret aerospace projects – and to engineers with good imaginations. In retrospect, it appears that he meant it.The world of covert technology and science has not been all that far ahead of open sci-tech, or so it has seemed. If the gap becomes too large, then the advantage in having such highly-advanced technology becomes too advantageous and it is used and thereby disclosed. The SR-71 Blackbird is an example; it could outrun Soviet surface-to-air missiles and its top speed never was made public, though SR-71s are now in museums. Over time, as the open-covert technology gap widens, leaks are bound to occur. Yet the greatest secret within the U.S. government has been held for well over 60 years.The fact that I am about to write about it (albeit without the certifiable rigor of an academic journal paper) shows that the great Gutenberg-style innovation of the 20th century – the Internet – makes possible such a dissemination of information that those intent on connecting dots or seeing the picture in jigsaw-puzzle pieces can begin to see some rather interesting pictures.It was in the early 20th century that R&D became formalized and institutionalized, beginning with Thomas Edison’s laboratories, the first examples of industrial research. The idea of invention as an activity in its own right caught on just as science had 500 years earlier. The rate of technical progress hit the steep knee of the curve in the 20th century, and those in power, whose interest is in using technology to gain geopolitical advantage, could not maintain that advantage without keeping it from competitors. Thus it has become of interest to those within the U.S. government (USG) and others to develop technology (and even basic science) in a parallel world underground (and quite literally, as we shall see).There are two instances of 20th-century covert technology that hint at the magnitude and the extent of advancement of secret development. One is the strange ending of WW II that is not found in the U.S. or U.K. history textbooks in either government or most privately-run schools. The NAZI movement had at its core an inner circle of the SS who, with Hitler, were members of an occult group, the Thule society. They were interested in and had certain beliefs about advanced (No one has yet explained certain remarkable features of the Great Pyramid at Giza such as its alignment with true north (despite millennia of subsidence) to twice the accuracy of the Paris Observatory, built with state-of-the-art civil engineering in the late 1800s. NAZI advanced R&D was under the direction of an engineer, Obergruppenführer Dr. Ing. Hans Kammler who reported to Himmler, making him one level away from the top.The breadth of technology projects under Kammler was immense; they included not only von Braun’s rocket works at Peenemünde but also secret physics experimentation in Thuringia, in large underground facilities. Near the end of the war, General Patton’s tanks did not head for Berlin but for Ohrdruf in Thuringia, where Auschwitz provided a pool of forced labor for the underground facilities.One of the secret weapons under development was the atomic bomb. The Establishment history teaches us, and correctly as far as it goes, that Heisenberg and the other highly visible Nobel-prize-winning German physicists did not have the resources in their heavy-water experiments to develop the bomb; Germany, it seems, did not have an adequate industrial base. However, this is a misleading half-truth, for Kammler had developed the Bomb, as reported in an article that appeared in theThe Germans had an atom bomb which would have been ready by October. A colossal blast effect was claimed for the German bomb. It was said it would wipe out everything inside a radius of six miles, said B.U.P. to-day. The German atomic plans were uncovered four months ago, when an Allied search party walked into a small silk factory at Celle, north of Hanover. A laboratory of two rooms was buried away in the heart of the factory. A famous research scientist was still at work. He was flown to Britain the same day. This man, with others, had been working on the atom bomb for months. The Nazi Government poured out money on it. Apparently they did not expect immediate results.As Joseph P. Farrell recounts in his book,The idea of a “Superbomb” was first patented prior to World War Two in Austria, and a modification of the idea was patented in Germany in 1943. [28] Its inventor, Dr. Karl Nowak, explained the reason for his invention as being to create a superbomb without the radioactive fallout effects that were evident from atomic and thermonuclear explosions! [29] In other words, the Nazis were already looking past the thermonuclear age toward the creation of second and third generation weapons systems that would give the same offensive and strategic “punch” but without the side effects!In theory, the bomb is workable, but was way beyond the technological capabilities of Germany, or any other power, in that time period. Basically, the idea was to create a state of matter in which, through ultra-low temperatures approaching absolute zero, matter would be super-compressed. The idea was then to detonate this material, subjecting it to sudden stress and heat, to create a sudden and massive expansion and explosion, and therewith, an enormous, H-bomb sized blast. [30] Thus, there may have been a basis in actual German secret research for the incredible claim of the Japanese military attache in Stockholm's 1943 report to Tokyo that the Germans were investigating the properties of super-dense matter for weaponization.[27] It should be recalled that Dr. Edward Teller actually first thought of, and proposed to the Allies, the hydrogen bomb in 1944.[28] German patent 905.847, March 16, 1943, cited in Mayer and Mehner,[29] Ibid., p. 159.[30] Ibid., p. 158.Farrell recounts what Kammler’s physicists would have known and their tendency to think “outside the box”. The example of engineer Ott Hilgenberg demonstrates this (from Farrell, p. 198, 199):Dr. Ing. Ott Christoph Hilgenberg was a student of the renowned Nobel laureate Walter Gerlach, whose work in magnetic spin polarization in 1921 had earned him the Nobel Prize. Hilgenberg, however, while within the “mainstream” of physics, was not one to allow his mind to be constrained by conventional concepts, as any glance at his two little known, but quite unconventional and thought-provoking papers will attest.In 1931 Hilgenberg published what may best be called an arcane paper entitled “Gravitation, Tromben, und Wellen in bewegten Medien,” or “Gravitation, Beats, and Waves in Moving Media.” The title itself is quite suggestive, for it is the first indication that, even before the Nazis, and after relativity, at least one serious and respected German physicist is still thinking of the old idea of an aether, but thinking about it in a way quite different from the static aether concepts of the 19th century that led to the famous Michelson-Morley experiment, and Sagnac's rotational version of it…Under Hilgenberg's influence, Carl Friedrich Krafft took this “vorticular quantum mechanics” one step further, and posited atoms as essentially a geometric or topological construct of the aether that acted as “ether pumps”, taking in or giving off energy based on the rotations of the various rings of dynamic aether around them. He developed this notion even further by positing various combinations of vorticular, rotating geometries as the basis for the then known sub-atomic particles. Krafft, whose views were totally eclipsed by war's end with the victory of the Allies – which likewise might be seen as a victory of relativity – was left to self-publish his works in this strange world of “non-linear physics”, which were duly and promptly ignored by the more conventionally minded linear physics of relativity and its proponents.It is well-known that the Germans had developed jet fighter aircraft by the end of the war. What is lesser known is the technology in advance of jet aircraft. As Farrell states:What the Germans were apparently trying to do was simply build a disk-shaped aircraft, the entire surface of which was both the turbine intake, as well as the lift surface. This was, so to speak, the “Mark I” flying saucer: a standard suction aircraft, albeit, with a very unconventional lift surface, which was one and the same as its fuselage and air intake.The idea was to suction the boundary layer, a cause of drag and an impediment for supersonic travel. That the Germans were working on flying saucers is in part corroborated by a 1980 article in the German magazine…the German fluidics engineer Heinrich Fleissner… was an engineer, designer and advisor to what he calls a “Flugscheibe” project based at Peenemuende during the war. It is interesting to note that Fleissner's area of expertise, fluidics, is exactly the specialty involved in investigating problems with boundary layer flow. Fleissner reports that the saucer with which he was involved would have been capable of speeds up to 3,000 kilometers per hour within the earth's atmosphere and up to 10,000 kilometers per hour outside the earth's atmosphere. He states that the brains of the developmental people were found in Peenemuende under the tightest secrecy. ….What is of most interest to us here are three facts. First, that Fleissner worked at Peenemuende on a flying saucer project. Second, that a hint of this design has survived to this day. Third, the surviving design can be linked to photographic evidence of German saucer, circa World War Two.Aerospace engineering combines with nuclear and quantum physics in the possible development under Kammler of propulsion which combined electromagnetics with gravity. One of the main goals of physics that has persisted into the 21st century is to find a theoretical means for unifying gravity with the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces (orThe Bell consisted apparently of two counter-rotating cylinders, and resembled a Bell in its general shape. It stood approximately 12 to 15 feet high, and was approximately 9 to 12 feet in diameter. Into this device, an unknown purplish metallic-liquid looking substance known only as “Xerum 525” or “Serum 525” was poured, apparently to be mechanically rotated at high speed, and possibly electrically rotated as well, by the device. The result was that organic objects placed within the field of the Bell swiftly decayed without putrefaction, decomposing into a black goo, and then finally, into dust, within a matter of hours, and not several weeks.So strong was the field that resulted from the Bell, that on its first test the technicians and scientists involved were all killed. Subsequently, the Bell was operated only for one or two minutes at a time, and housing below ground in a room bricked and tiled with ceramic tiles, which were then covered in thick rubber mats. After each test, the mats were burned, and the room washed down by concentration camp inmates with brine.When [Nick] Cook was shown the installation in which the Bell was housed, he was also informed of its high electrical consumption. What was the mysterious “Xerum 525?” When I first read of this substance which had to be stored in lead lined cylinders, I first thought it sounded like a radioactive isotope of mercury, or perhaps some other radioactive material suspended in solution of some sort.More recently, allegations have surfaced concerning the neutron emitting properties of so-called “red mercury” or mercury antimonate oxide, supposedly a source for detonating thermonuclear warheads without the necessity for detonating an atom bomb, and a powerful conventional explosive in its own right. Whatever the mysterious substance was, it seems clear that it was highly radioactive, and that the Germans were subjecting it to extremely high mechanical and electrical rotations to study the resulting field effects, effects that Cook's advisors could only qualify as “torsion” fields. These fields are thought by some contemporary physicists to have direct relevance to the study of gravity, and of time.Close to the Bell's underground testing bunker the Germans had built a large concrete henge-like structure, in the pillars of which were high grade steel hooks, an obvious testing frame for what must have been an extremely powerful propulsion device. What happened to the Bell? No one knows. Like Kammler, it goes completely missing at the end of the war, and its scientists, as already stated, were murdered to a man by the SS to keep whatever precious secrets it, and they, had uncovered.Kammler had extremely wide R&D authority in Germany, not only over rocket development but over nine underground laboratories, one of which was destroyed and the other eight missing at the end of the war along with thousands of Germans whose absence could not be accounted for by war mishaps. The Germans had, before WW II, an interest in planning for every contingency including the possible loss of the war. A German military expedition was sent to Antarctica and from this large project it is believed that some part of what is now Queen Maude Land (Neuschwabia) became the NAZI redoubt to which not only the laboratories and many persons but also one of the two giant Junkers aircraft and the large freighter-sized submarines disappeared.One year after the war, when America was depleted and in recovery, a major military expedition, Operation Highjump under the command of Admiral Byrd, went to Antarctica for what resulted in a prematurely terminated operation. Byrd’s comments point to having encountered an unexpected threat that Byrd intimated involved advanced aerospace technology. Today, the USG South Pole station is run under tight security and is conducting what are essentially covert operations there.Farrell also includes in his book the NAZI Antarctic “fortress of solitude” (p. 239):…Nazi survival myths run the whole spectrum, from fanciful and implausible stories of underground bases in the Canadian Arctic, or on Antarctica itself armed with some of the exotic weaponry described in the previous chapter, to more “mundane” and plausible stories of Nazi colonies in South America or secret weather stations and commando teams operating in Greenland during the war, to the well-known and best documented case, that of Operation Paperclip, America's wholesale importation of Nazi scientists and doctors after World War Two to assist the United States in continued covert development and research on a whole host of black projects.And what does Farrell think happened to Kammler and his work? From p. 240:…the secret weapons think tank, the Kammlerstab, survived the war more or less intact, and continued its work in a variety of host countries, most particularly in the United Kingdom and even more so in the United States, either in concert with them, and sometimes independently of them.The technology of large underground working spaces was first pioneered in modern times by the NAZIs and has been vastly expanded by the USG, though almost all of it is unknown to the public. Dr. Richard Sauder has made it his quest to explore this undisclosed topic. The NAZIS would have had the tunneling technology required to go underground (or under ice) in Antarctica, though this intriguing aspect of post-WW II NAZIs in Antarctica, Argentina and Chile is a topic for future coverage.The second undisclosed area – the biggest secret within the USG – is further outside the box than what actually happened at the end of WW II and requires some mental preparation to consider seriously. Thus it will be left for a subsequent article. To give a hint, it relates to what Farrell and some others think was an incident involving secret post-WW II NAZI technology: the Roswell incident in New Mexico. Others think it was an event involving extraterrestrials. The history of projects about UFOs and ETs by the USG and others relates back to what Ben Rich might have had in mind.One of the best documentary pieces of evidence regarding UFOs is the “Twining memo” of U.S. General Nathan Twining, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1955-58. In it (September 23, 1947, AF200-20) he wrote concerning UFOs: “The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.” Even General Douglas MacArthur said (In Britain, Commander in Chief of the Royal Air Force, Marshall Lord Dowding, (Exopolitics might be the most closely guarded secret, though other countries are more open about it. These topics take engineers a long way from transistor circuit modeling, yet there is sufficient evidence to consider the matter seriously from a technical standpoint. Some of the best investigators involved are engineers, such as Stanton Frieand Robert Wood The consequences for disclosure are enormous and some people are making the case that highly-advanced covert technology should be made public for the benefit of the world.",14 followers,Eric Grumling,9,122,144.2K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technologies-that-people-dont-know-about-yet

I truly believe that I have a moral obligation to reduce the impacts of technology on people, or my children to say the least. That’s due to several reasons some of which would be: it is contrary to nature, it rips our humanity away and it kills social interactions especially in our youngsters.Let me delve into the details. Technology is the opposite of nature. It is created at the expense of nature because it annihilates human traits. For instance, one of the most provoking technologies made was the segway or the hover board. I mean for god’s sake, really? As if we need another reason to be lazy, to actually stop using our own legs to walk. Do you know what paraplegic people are willing to give just to have a slightest chance of walking on their two legs again? These kinds of technologies make humans take everything for granted, it makes them ungrateful. Technology deteriorates human character. It separates us from nature, which diminishes our very natural self. We become artificial as we start behaving just like those machines.Regardless of our use of technology, I am quite guilty of using it as well. Microwaves for example, emit radiations that are harmful to living things. Microwaves come in very handy and useful but at the expense of our own health. Likewise, the X-rays, which have definitely made a major breakthrough in the medical field but also, have serious implications when exposed to it frequently.So how much of our health are we willing to risk for the sake of “technologies advantages”?Let me now tell you about my 14 year old brother. He is always using his cell phone, although he does use it in a way different than most of children his age would (as he subscribes to space related and scientific YouTube channels), still it is making him more isolated than ever. He texts mom while she’s right in the next room. Teenagers today are completely occupied with technological advancements that their communication skills are slowly dying. I’m a firm believer that the growth of technology as it is will negatively impact the social interactions of today's teenager even more than we thought it would, because it detaches people from reality and restricts communication. If we do not look reality in the eye and experience new things, make personal relationships, and try solving problems, then this generation will never really be able to behave as adults. In developmental teen years, lack of personal communication due to excessive Internet exposure can have an overall negative impact on both mental and physical health. Communication skills are crucial for everyone, yet usage of the Internet is undermining this very development.Maybe I was born in the wrong era, maybe, although I’m pretty sure. And I’m certain that previous generations were much more interesting and natural than ours could ever be. Therefore, I can’t help but pity the next generations to come they might not even know what natural means.",86 followers,Dan Spiesz,99,87,304.3K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technologies-that-people-dont-know-about-yet

So, in the 1960’s and 1970’s, the U.S. had leadership, but only through their corporations.The Space Shuttle was the follow up to the Saturn V, and it led the world in technology for the 80’s and 90’s, except for the single launch of the Buran, which arguably was a superior vehicle, albeit one which the faltering Soviet Union couldn’t afford to maintain.And then in 2011, the Shuttle era came to an end.And, almost without anyone noticing, Russia simply inherited the title.Not through innovation. Lord knows the Soyuz and Progress rockets were both designed in the 1960’s, based on modified R7 rockets initial built from the captured V2 rockets built by the Third Reich in the mid-40’s.To this day, the Soyuz is still launchedThat’s not what I’d call “space-age technology.”The U.S. government, with the end of the shuttle, pushed for the reuse of all the parts used to make the shuttle for the new replacement Constellation program. A program that even the most optimistic estimates put at launching in the 2020’s at a cost of over $40So, Constellation was canceled, except for the Orion capsule. And then they pushed the SLS instead, still re-using the parts of the 1960’s designed Space Shuttle (along with updates from the 90’s and early 2000’s).SLS has now burned through at least $12So, China started developing space flight, and they’ve successfully put astronauts and even two space stations into orbit. But calling them advanced would ignore the fact that they have, almost bolt for bolt, copied the Russian Soyuz capsule and the Progress rocket with its horribly poisonous UDMH and N2O4 hypergolic fuel. Even Russia is retiring that sad old dinosaur.In fact, a lot of the current batch of decades-old rockets are being retired.Why?Because of two corporations. One of them is very public, and one is very secretive, but both of them have taken the Aerospace industry and shaken it to its absolute core.The public one is SpaceX, the private one is Blue Origin. Both of them went out and did what everyone said was impossible. They built new engines from scratch with new technology, put them into new rockets built from scratch with new technology, and launched them.But, more importantly, they landed them.You see, other than one part of one rocket, the shuttle orbiter, no other rocket has ever landed before. (Yes, they re-used the boosters too, but the price of refurbishing them after a dip in the ocean was arguably higher than just building them over every time, and they had to be shipped back to Utah to be refurbished anyway. If you have to take something apart down to parts, swap out half the parts, and then rebuild it — is itSo, this has scared the entire launch industry, worldwide, out of their socks.SpaceX is talking about reusing a Block 5 booster within 24 hours. They’re working on BFR, which they claim can be reused as quickly as you can refuel it.Blue Origins’ New Shepard is a bit of a hobby rocket for sightseers, but it proved out BO’s ability to land a rocket and reuse it. New Glenn is a super-heavy lifter that has yet to fly, but will have the same reusability as a SpaceX Falcon 9.And they’re not stopping there. SpaceX is already on the brink of recovering cargo fairings, which would save them $6M per flight, and they’re about to test second stage recovery, which would mean the entire consumables from a flight would basically reduce to the fuel, and a few plastic covers, a compression ring on the second stage engine bell, and a small amount of ablative heat shielding.We already know that the cost per flight for those goods is under a million dollars.We know the full cost of a Falcon 9 flown in expendable mode, is $63 million.If SpaceX can really refly a rocket 100 times, then your amortized cost per flight drops under $2M. To put 30 tons into orbit. That’s $66 per kilogram to orbit.Current spaceflight averages are in the $20,000 per kilogram to orbit. That means a 300x difference in cost.That’s not just a “leader” in space technology, that’s utterly disruptive to the whole industry.Spending $66 a kilo to put something into orbit is about three times the cost FedEx charges to ship a package overnight. Now you can get to orbit for three times the cost of sending cookies across the country as a care package. That’s going to open whole new industries in space.And no other country is close. Russia is claiming their new Angara rocket will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one.The traditional US companies are claiming Vulcan will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one, and they’re asking for $5 billion in research funding from the Air Force to build it.China is making noise about a fully reusable craft, but as I pointed out, their launch vehicle is based around the same technology that Russia has been using since the 1960’s, and they’ve taken to dropping first stages onto populated cities, which is not exactly going to be helping with national pride.The only competition for SpaceX right now is New Glenn, and that has yet to fly.In fact, their closest competitor might very well be……SpaceX.Their next rocket, the BFR (BigNo one else, no government, no nation, is even close to that.So, yeah, the leader in space right now — it’s a corporation, not a company.Honorable mentions: Rocket Lab is getting ready to send “It’s Business Time” — their latest Electron rocket — into space carrying several hundred kilos of cube-sats into orbit. They’re doing this for $7M a launch (estimated) which is still in line with the $20,000 per kilo launch price, but very few other services cater to micro-sat launches yet, so this is a way to get your own, personal cube-sat into orbit for less than the price of a new car.There’s also about a dozen other companies that are following in Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos’ footsteps and starting private launch companies. The whole industry has been re-invigorated.",38 followers,Richard Lupo,0,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technologies-that-people-dont-know-about-yet

Others, like IBM, or General Electric are old-guard giants betting on technology renewal. And the list is full of ambitious startups like SpaceX, which is changing the economics of space travel with reusable rockets.1.Nvidia:-Though Nvidia still makes most of its money from selling graphics chips for video games, it has established itself as the leading provider of processing power for AI software, and its newer, AI-related businesses are growing quickly. During its most recent financial quarter, revenues from its data-center and automotive businesses increased by 186 percent and 24 percent, respectively, over the previous year. The company says all the major Internet and cloud-service providers use its chips to accelerate their processes, and a number of large carmakers, including Toyota, are using its autonomous-driving technology.$3 billion: spending on R&D to create its new data-center chip.Nvidia CEO: Software Is Eating the World, but AI Is Going to Eat SoftwareThe Race to Power AI’s Silicon BrainsDrones and Robots Are Taking Over Industrial InspectionBattle to Provide Chips for the AI Boom Heats Up2.SpaceX:- ◆In 2017, SpaceX proved it’s possible to fly a rocket into space carrying a payload, bring it back, refurbish it, and launch it again with a new payload. Reusable rockets make space travel far cheaper and faster: they are critical to SpaceX’s long-term goal of establishing an interplanetary transport system. The startup also compressed the time needed to refit its recycled rockets (from one year to a few months) and began preliminary tests of its Falcon Heavy booster, which is expected to be the world’s most powerful rocket when it is completed later this year.10 percent: price discount being considered for customers who agree to fly their payloads on reused rockets3.Amazon:-Industry Connectivity ◆ Status Public ◆ Valuation $479.3 billionAmazon is using a range of AI technologies, including computer vision, machine learning, and natural-language processing, to reinvent mobile computing and shopping. The company’s voice-activated assistant Alexa now controls everything from TVs to cars and is poised to be the next important computing platform. Amazon is also streamlining the brick-and-mortar shopping experience through its Seattle-based Amazon Go convenience store. Customers simply enter the store, scan an app on their smartphones, and walk out with the items they wish to purchase. Amazon uses AI, cameras, and sensors to identify the products they have selected and bills them automatically—no lines or checkouts necessary.12,000: number of programs that software developers have published for Alexa with Empathy4.23andMeA pioneer of direct-to-consumer genetic testing since its founding in 2006, 23andMe ran into trouble in 2013 when the FDA barred it from distributing health information. But this year the regulator changed course and reopened a major business line for the company, permitting it to market genetic reports on risks for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and eight other conditions. After extracting DNA from the cells in saliva samples sent in by customers, the company uses a DNA-genotyping chip made by Illumina (No. 22) to capture features related to health and ancestry—information customers are then able to access online. 23andMe now has more than two million customers worldwide, and its products have been used in a number of research projects, including studies of female fertility, depression, Parkinson’s disease, and even nail biting.1 million plus: number of customers who have consented to have their genetic information used for scientific research5.AlphabetAlphabet’s subsidiaries are technology leaders in AI, autonomous vehicles, and AR and VR, among other areas. Its DeepMind division keeps devising new ways for AI systems to mimic human intelligence and learn more quickly. Its self-driving-car project, Waymo, continues to improve performance and has aggressively defended its intellectual property by suing rival Uber after a top engineer switched teams. Google, Alphabet’s best-known and largest subsidiary, is collaborating with hardware makers to create standalone VR headsets for its Daydream VR platform. The new models will have built-in displays and processors rather than relying on users’ smartphones, and will use sensors to better track peoples’ movements in virtual worlds.40 percent: amount of energy the company says it saves applying machine-learning algorithms from its DeepMind subsidiary to cooling its data center.6.iFlytek:-iFlytek already dominates China’s voice recognition market and is now expanding into voice-activated command systems for cars, homes, robots, and schools. In the past year, it launched systems that enable people to control their cars, TVs, and home appliances via voice; invested in a startup that makes home robots; and established a joint venture to develop educational products that incorporate its instant translation features. It also established a multimillion-dollar fund to invest in AI-related startups around the world. It says that more than 160,000 developers use its software and more than 400 million people use its products.70 percent: iFlytek’s share of China’s market in voice-based technologies.7.Kite PharmaThis immunotherapy company is taking the body’s T cells, which naturally fight infections, and engineering them to fight cancer. It is farthest along with its therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with more than a third of one study’s participants showing no sign of disease six months after treatment. There were two deaths associated with the therapy based on its known side effects—approximately 2 percent of study participants—but it seems to be nearing FDA approval.39 percent: proportion of study participants very sick with lymphoma who showed no sign of the disease six months after a single treatment with Kite’s therapy.8. Tencent:-It’s been a blowout year for Tencent, which owns China’s biggest social network, WeChat, and is also the world’s largest video-gaming company. Though WeChat already boasts more than 900 million monthly active users, Tencent keeps expanding the mobile app so that it now offers messaging, online gaming, shopping, music, videos, and peer-to-peer payments. The breadth of features attracts new users and keeps existing ones active inside WeChat, which enables Tencent to sell more ads and services. In April, the Internet giant passed Wells Fargo to become one of the world’s 10 most valuable companies by market capitalization, thanks to growth in its gaming, online advertising, and payments businesses.50 percent: proportion of WeChat’s 770 million daily users who are on the service at least 90 minutes a day.8.Regeneron:-A well-established biotech with a track record in treating eye and other diseases, Regeneron emphasizes the use of genetic information to focus its drug development efforts. In March it announced that, along with the U.K. Biobank and pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, it would be sequencing genetic data from 500,000 volunteers to help support research into drug development and the connections between DNA and disease. It’s also put a focus on creating “off-the-shelf” engineered T cells to target tumors without requiring a patient’s own immune cells to be used, an approach that could make this field of treatment much easier to scale. Company revenue for calendar year 2016 was $4.9 billion, net income nearly $900 million.500,000: number of U.K. volunteers whose genetic data it is helping sequence10.Spark Therapeutics:-In addition to its treatment for a progressive form of blindness, the company has also been testing a way to combat hemophilia B, a blood clotting disorder, by intravenous treatment with viruses carrying a corrected version of the gene that codes for a blood-clotting protein called factor IX. This is one to watch because the disease, which affects one in 5,000 men, is expensive to treat conventionally.1 in 30,000: estimated number of individuals affected by the disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy11.Face ++ :-Facial recognition services are prevalent in China, and Face++’s software powers many of the country’s most popular applications. Alipay, the popular online payment platform, uses the technology to let users log in and make payments using their face as ID; ride-sharing provider Didi Chuxing uses it to verify the identity of its freelance drivers; and smartphone app maker Meitu uses it to offer highly detailed photo-retouching features. The five-year-old startup is believed to be the first facial recognition “unicorn,” having raised at least $145 million in recent years, including at least $100 million in December 2016.106: maximum number of points on a person’s face that its technology tracks12.First Solar:-Landed some of the biggest solar-plant deals in the world last year, including a 140-megawatt solar farm in North Queensland, Australia, the largest in that country. The company, which develops, constructs, and operates photovoltaic power plants connected to the electric grid, also continues to invest heavily in its cadmium telluride cells, a promising alternative to silicon solar cells that are making big advances. This year is off to a good start too, with the company reporting better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2017 and raising expectations for its current quarter as well.$2.9 billion: estimated 2017 revenue13.Intel:-Intel is benefiting from a series of AI-centric investments and acquisitions it made to offset the decline of its main market, chips for personal computers. In the past year, it bought the deep-learning startup Nervana, the computer-vision chipmaker Movidius, and Mobileye, a supplier of assisted-driving systems. The Movidius purchase enabled Intel to sell chips to drone giant DJI, while the Mobileye acquisition brought it autonomous-driving partnerships with BMW and Delphi Automotive. In March, Intel launched an AI products group to further accelerate its AI efforts.46 percent: portion of revenues derived from areas beyond PC chips14.Quanergy Systems:-There are many startups trying to create compact, low-cost, high-quality lidar systems for autonomous vehicles, but Quanergy was the first to develop one using solid-state technology, which increases the reliability of the laser-scanning radar. The startup’s lidar is also relatively cheap to make because it uses some of the same materials and manufacturing processes as computer chips. The sensors, which are small enough to be embedded in car headlights, can be used in advanced driver-assistance systems and will be integrated into autonomous vehicles by 2021.$250: price of its S3 Lidar sensors for autonomous vehicles15.Apple:-Derided of late for a lack of innovative new products and tepid customer response to Apple Pay and the Apple Watch, Apple has launched a Siri-enabled speaker called HomePod to compete with Amazon’s Alexa-equipped Echo speaker. It’s also begun to tout its AI chops, including acknowledging its work on autonomous-driving systems. For some time Apple has been quietly hiring some impressive robotics and AI talent for its project, and its history of smart design and smooth integration of hardware and software may prove valuable assets.$257 billion: cash on its balance sheet, more than the entire market value of General Electric.Hope you enjoy.","5,315 followers",Valerio Cietto,999,2.4K,9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technologies-that-people-dont-know-about-yet

Why would you want a combined reactor? Fusion makes a neutron flux. Neutrons absorbed by fissionable isotopes release energy that competes with fusion. There is plenty of fissionable fuel in the world. The more gets used for energy the less is available for weapons.Neutrons absorbed by other radioactive isotopes nearly always lead to shorter half lives. There is plenty of nuclear waste in the world. Being able to burn it away would be wonderful. Being able to get some amount of usable energy from it would be even better.What technology would be needed? In addition to plasma control enough to do fusion we would need isotopic separation beyond anything dreamed of now. About a century beyond the point of commercial fusion.Imagine a world were the amount of nuclear waste is dropping rapidly and it has become a resource to make electricity.

Fission Ignited Fusion is not uncontrolled fusion in any sense (as is also the case with an internal combustion engine - you only get an explosion within a cylinder of a magnitude equal to the fuel and air supplied - not any more and not any less). Inertial Confinement Fission Ignited Fusion is controlled fusion and produces practical commercially significant amounts of fusion energy reliably from the same D-T or D-D fusion reactions as tokamaks or stellarator experiments (there is actually no difference at all in the fusion fuels burned or the nuclear waste [helium] produced).Fission Ignited Inertial Confinement Fusion is practical nuclear fusion that works now (not always just 30 years from now) and could be harnessed today and used to lift the conditions of all mankind.In modern implementations[1], Fusion Ignited Fission can use as little as 0.25 grams of fissile U233, U235, or Pu239 to ignite about 8 grams of Deuterium using D-D fusion and produce, with help of a fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator), a fusion burst of about 100 Gigajoules per shot (the energy released in efficiently burning about 779 gallons of gasoline).Magnetic Confinement tokamaks like ITER will not begin to operate with DT fusion fuel which could permit break-even energy production until 2035.Why sink all fusion effort into ITER and wait another 20 years before even starting to explore commercial forms of fusion energy?Does it not make some sense to explore the ICF fusion technology that has been demonstrated to currently reliably work, and try to evolve the technology into a reliable and cost effective pure fusion commercial form?The resources needed to finish developing commercial forms of fission-fusion and pure ICF fusion are already in place. Fusion researchers just need to be granted access and part time use of underground facilities like U1a at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site to safely perform the experiments needed.U1a ComplexA Pure fusion version of ICF fusion evolved from military fission-fusion is very possible. In 2001 DOE permitted previously undisclosed information to be released regarding cold war era efforts to produce ultra-clean pure fusion devices that could be used in a purely defensive role to defend home soil (a last stand against overwhelmingly superior conventional military infantry and tank forces).

Over 200 tokamak fusion experiments have to date been built worldwide. To this point, not one single MCF experiment has produced more energy from fusion than the energy required to operate the MCF fusion device.Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments, on the other hand worked and produced greatly in excess of break-even energy from fusion from their very first experimental attempt (Ivy-Mike 1952).ICF fusion has never failed.It makes some sense to technically evolve working smaller and cleaner versions of ICF fusion tech derived from military technology. Such efforts could produce practical fusion power plants in less time (perhaps 3–5 years with help from LANL or LLNL National Labs) and at significantly less cost (cold war underground field tests cost on average about $2 million dollars per shot - and that includes all expenses both adminsitrative and technical to design and build an experimental device, safely test the device underground in the field , and carefully analyse the data obtained from the test).Why does virtually all consideration and funding currently exclusively go to MCF fusion technology that has never once in history produced any net energy, even for milliseconds?Why does ICF fusion, which has never failed, sit on the technical sidelines disregarded as if irrelevant (or excessively dangerous) when it is the quickest, least technically risky, and arguably the safest path to peaceful power generation - just because of its military origins?ICF fusion is practical and infinely scaleable.You can easily and seemlessly without gaps produce ICF fusion devices as small (or as LARGE) as is desired without any problems relating to critical mass and scale.Pure ICF fusion has had considerable amounts of technical work put into it.A pure fusion explosive is a nuclear device design that does not need a fission ""primary"" explosive to ignite the fusion of a deuterium or deuterium-tritium second stage.(It may now be revealed)DOE's once classified cold war pure fusion programDOE published in 2001 the following document relating to its cold war pure fusion test program -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/...contained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment.

The theory was presented his paper, “ The Internal Constitution of The Stars.” Around 1938, German nuclear physicist Hans Bethe formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis based on proton-proton fusion. This turned out to be the correct explanation for the mechanism by which stars generate energy. Prior to 1920, the source of stellar energy was total mystery. Over all the centuries before, no one knew the answer to the question, “Why do the stars shine?”The series of equations Bethe formulated explained the scientific basis for stellar energy production. The reactions he described involve thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium which releases an enormous amount of energy based on the Einstein formula E=MC2. For this work, Hans Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1967.As far back as 1938, the idea of building a generator based on fusion was being discussed and after World War II, research in fusion power accelerated. However, it was not long before scientists began to realize that artificial fusion was considerably more difficult than making a fission reactor. Nuclear fusion is possible in stars because the combination heat and immense gravity brings nuclei in close enough proximity that the electrostatic Coulomb Barrier, which keeps atoms apart, can be overcome. At that point, the strong nuclear force ( this being the fundamental force that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus), predominates and fusion can then take place via Quantum Tunnelling.Beginning in the 1950s, physicists and engineers began efforts to develop a terrestrial generator based on Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion,(CTNF) that would replicate what stars do naturally. It was well known that fusion of light nuclei like hydrogen was capable of producing an amount of energy 3 orders of magnitude greater than the opposite process of fission using very heavy elements such as uranium. Moreover, CTNF does not create high level radioactive waste and the essential fuel for a fusion device is Deuterium ( heavy hydrogen) which can be extracted from sea water. Our oceans contain an approximate 50 million year supply of this fuel.After several decades of research into CTNF, scientists became aware of the enormous complexity involved in the development of a terrestrial fusion machine. CTNF on Earth requires the use of much higher temperatures ( far greater than that found in the Sun), on the order of 150 million degrees Celsius.The past 50 years of fusion research has been focused on devising a mechanism to hold active plasma at this high temperature in an apparatus for long enough to generate usable energy.Given that it is impossible to create a gravitational field on Earth that would approximate that which is present in a star, a correlate had to be devised. The entity that corresponds to gravity in artificial fusion studies is intensely powerful fields generated by superconductor magnets. ITER will utilize a 13 Tesla magnetic field. The concept is that with such a “magnetic bottle” it will be possible to contain , in a stable configuration, fusion plasma which is also sustainable. This difficulty involving plasma stability is perhaps the principle engineering and physics challenge that has made development of fusion a very slow process. Thermonuclear fusion can be started within an experimental machine known as Tokamak which is a toroidal ( doughnut shaped) chamber. The Deuterium - Tritium fuel is heated to the very high temperature which allows thermonuclear fusion to begin. However, as I have noted, the resulting plasma has to be held at that temperature to maintain continuous fusion long enough to generate usable energy.Over the past 30 years or so, it has become clear that an apparatus using the tokamak configuration offers the greatest potential for development of CTNF as a future method for generating energy. This approach is known as the“ Magnetic Confinement” method.Several experimental tokamak devices have been in operation around the world for the past 20 years. These have demonstrated that CTNF can be achieved. Yet, the active plasma can only be contained for brief periods of time that measure in seconds. In present day research machines which do not allow for sustained control, the temperature within the tokamak drops and the active plasma looses coherence and flickers out of existence. It is just as if one had blown out a candle. Thus , the essential problem to be solved is to discover a mechanism that allows one to maintain control of the fusion plasma for an extended period. I would not regard it as an understatement to say that stable plasma confinement is the last remaining obstacle standing in the way practical CTNF.As you are reading this commentary, there is an international group constructing a complex apparatus designed to verify that CTNF is possible. This is the ITER Consortium which is comprised of the European Union, United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Russia and China.ITER is an acronym for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. ITER is also the Latin word meaning The Way. This scientific project is going to pave the way for a new method of generating energy. Construction of ITER began in 2010 in Cadarche France. As of 6 June \2020, the installation was 69.3% of the way to full completion. When the apparatus is completed, the first plasma experiments will commence. On the current schedule, the date for initial operation of ITER is December \ 2025. The total cost, to be shared amongst the consortium, will be ~ $20 Billion.At full power, ITER is designed to generate 500 MW of excess power. Once this milestone is reached, the world will be on a direct path to a new source of energy. The way will be open to constructing commercial fusion power stations all across our planet.I have studied the subject of CTNF for the last 30 years out of an innate and profound interest. Within the past few years, in the midst of writing a novel, I have followed closely the ongoing research efforts. Taken together, my natural optimism for the future and my intuitional sense informs me that generation of energy via controlled fusion will be realized. I believe this will happen in my own lifetime. The advent of plentiful fusion based energy will profoundly alter the entire course of Human Civilization.

Put two rockets pointing in opposite directions blowing up bombs 1/60 th of a second apart each operating at precisely 30x per second and let the plasma stream flow through a MHD generator for each exhaust plume and switch the two generators we would have a 60 Hz AC generator producing 83.68 terawatts of power!Humanity today uses only 17 terawatts of power burning stuff that died long time ago.

We have had fusion for the past 63 years.http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-detailsThe first fusion ‘super’ bomb was built and tested March 1, 1954 in the Pacific Range.This used the Jetter Cycle, a nuclear fuel cycle discovered by Ulrich Jetter in the late 40s. Fission normally takes place by the absorption of a neutron by a fissile material which causes the material to break down and release more neutrons. So, controlling neutron flux by absorption or reflecting lost neutrons back into the pile, controls the power output. That’s because materials heavier than Iron-56 release energy when they break apart.Fusion of course occurs when nuclei lighter than Iron 56 join together to create heavier materials. This is easily seen in the energy per nucleon chart of all isotopes of elements.Jetter looked carefully at the energy per nucleon data accumulated across the periodic table and noticed that Lithium-6 and to a lesser extent Beryllium and Boron, drop in energy dramatically - leaving Helium-4 to form a sort of spike that interrupts the smooth curve.Well, Jetter understood that Lithium-6 readily absorbs a neutron to form a Triton and an Alpha particle - releasing 4.8 MeV. 77.17 TJ/kg of Lithium-6! Of course you need 1/6th kg of neutrons to make that happen. However, Jetter also knew that the Triton had way more energy than needed to fuse with a Deuteron releasing another 17.6 MeV. Another 339.6 TJ/kg of D+T. When Tritium combines with Deuterium you get another Alpha aka Helium-4 and you get your neutron back.Given the way energy and momentum add, most of the energy ends up in the neutron. That can be a good thing because you can put something in that absorbs energetic neutrons and produces more less energetic neutrons - allowing a sort of fission to take place.The net reaction is Lithium-6 plus Deuterium produce 2 Helium-4 plus 22.4 MeV. The net reaction 270.2 TJ/kg of Lithium6Deuteride. a White Powder that’s 0.82 g/cc.Now, the material you put in the mix to manage the production of many low energy neutrons from a single high energy neutron determines how fast the reaction can grow.More on Jetter Cycle here.https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdfSo, if you want to make a hydrogen bomb like Castle Bravo, you need a prompt source of a lot of neutrons, which a fission device provides (the heat and pressure have nothing to do with it).Yet, by 1956 researchers had developed a fission free bomblet that they called “The Humanitarian H-Bomb” and folks began talking about nuclear pulse spaceships. Enthusiasts worked on these things until destroyed by Fake News, needless National Security Classification and innuendo and finally explicitly prohibited by Nuclear Test Ban signed by LBJ.

(mp Li6D 692C, mp Zn 419.5 C) this is perfect! Operating a molten salt reactorhttps://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/28/010/28010511.pdfA molten salt reactor consisting of Lithium-6 Deuteride in combination with powdered Zinc in the right combination, started with a neutron source (Californium) which is an off-the-shelf itemNuclear Reactor Rod Assemblies(NSA) | Frontier Technology CorporationCastle Bravo was the nuclear bomb test. Project Sherwood (still classified) was the nuclear fusion reactor program. The success was so great that Lewis Strauss the chair of the AEC at the time (AEC preceded DoE) when asked about the coming peak oil situation predicted for 1970, said to reporters that by 1970 energy would be ‘too cheap to meter’. Shortly after Strauss was embroiled in a controversy, Fake News of the day, and removed from power. Other enthusiasts scheduled to testify before Congress about commercialising the results of Project Sherwood died in an unfortunate helicopter accident in the Pacific Range during a nuclear test. So, the testimony never took place. The Join Chiefs re-classified the data following the departure of Strauss, and the congressional committee on nuclear fusion began the hot fusion research program we have today.Lewis Strauss after his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - accused of corruption.Lewis Strauss before his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - hero who would bring us the ‘super’ bomb.The world today produces 600,000 tonnes of lithium per year and 45,000 tonnes (7.5%) is lithium-6. Lithium-6 is easily separated from Lithium-7 (which acts as a poison to the Jetter cycle).Deuterium is easily separated from heavy water, which is easily made from sea water. So, humanity can make 60,000 tonnes of Lithium-6 Deuteride at a cost of $480 million - $8 per kg. - $0.48 billion.Humanity spend $6,400 billion on coal, natural gas and crude oil each year. Another $2,000 billion per year is spent by the world’s military to secure supplies of oil.At 270.2 TJ/kg the cost of course is too cheap to meter. The reaction products are 1 kg of Helium-4 for each kg of Li6D. 60,000 tonnes produces 1.621 *10^22 Joules per year. 514.08 TW.Humanity, burning coal, natural gas, and crude oil, produces 17.6 TW of power. So, we produce 29.21x the energy we need from Lithium-6 Deuteride. So, actual cost of fuel is $16.4 million per year.Herman Kahn, futurist for RAND Corporation said of this process that Capitalism would defeat Communism because Capitalism will make all proletariats millionaires by 1990. Interestingly, the promise of making us all millionaires outlined by Milton Friedman, was a large measure of how Capitalism defeated Communism by 1990.The importance of nuclear energy including Lithium-6 was outlined in 1956 by Marion King Hubbert.http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdfOil company executives that advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Eisenhower at the time, thought that high temperature reactors of the type proposed by Jetter were premature. Energy too cheap to meter harmed the shareholders of the oil companies by destroying the value of their reserves in which they have considerable sunk costs that cannot be recovered.DoE today inherited high temperature reactor research - and continues to research the topic to this day - along with hot plasma fusion research.Today DoE officials predict that by 2040 we will be ready to commercialise high temperature reactors that produce hydrogen by direct thermolysis of sea water.Brookhaven proposed this approach in the 1950s using large 200 GW Sherwood type reactors. 180 such reactors today would make 4 billion tons of hydrogen - replacing all legacy fuels.Very-high-temperature reactor - WikipediaThe folks who worked on Sherwood did additional work on the atomic airplane after Sherwood. Also, the atomic rocket program after their earlier work.Reading their reports as Senator, future President Kennedy was inspired to include Rover nuclear rocket and GE’s nuclear airplane program in his vision for a space program (before it was turned into a moon program by Johnson) as a way to pump up American technical capacity to make America’s industry the best in the world.That’s why Kennedy mentions nuclear energy in his Rice speech and its importance to US future industrial strength.There are also lots of references in the JFK library to nuclear power when he was senator. The Boeing SST 2707- could have been powered by GE atomic jet power had there not been those who opposed this as well as other initiatives of the young president.SST-2707 Powered by four GE4-J5 engines.

A 12 fold increase in volume increases area 5.2x - more than doubling performance per unit weight of the smaller 10 unit.The weight of the larger nuclear power source was less than the weight of fuel carried in the fuel tank for a typical supersonic mission - giving the aircraft unlimited range - despite its speed. Creating huge logistical advantages. Further, since the cost of fuel over the life of an aircraft exceeds the value of the aircraft. Boeing could easily double the price of airplanes powered by nuclear power plants and airlines would be ahead logistically and economically. Airlines that still had to fool with jet fuel and had limited range and speed wouldn’t be able to compete.The point is, the top dog of Project Sherwood was asked to resign his post over Fake News in 1959, and the top managers of Project Sherwood sadly died in a helicopter crash on the Pacific Range before giving testimony to Congress, while the engineers who worked on the project under these geniuses moved to the atomic airplane program and the atomic rocket program.JFK met with them as he was developing his plans for creating an integrated industrial development program for the USA around these and other future technologies - inspired and justified by space exploration.Some of the technical team ended up at Oak Ridge national lab and built a fission version of their high temperature salt reactor - before it was killed by Carter following Chernobyl.","3,650 followers",William Mook,99,9.3K,12.5M,https://www.quora.com/When-will-Fusion-reactors-become-a-reality

From the mass of fuel you use less than 0.4% of that mass is converted into energy. But those less than 0.4% release an immense amount of energy.Now. The most common used method in a nuclear fusion reactor is to heat up the gas/gases inside the reactor to temperatures reaching 100 million degrees Celsius or more. The reactor then uses very powerful electromagnetic fields to contain the resulting ionized plasma. Really because no element on Earth could ever hope to withstand such a temperature.In order for you to roughly know just how much energy you can get in a nuclear fusion reactor, you simply use E=(Mx0.4%).C²Where E is energy in Joules, M is mass, and C is the speed of light.Why Mx0.4%?! Because like I told you above, in a fusion reaction even in stars, less than 0.4% of the mass is converted into energy. More precisely 0.38% So using 0.4% gives you a very close value.So obviously if you used let's say 1Kg of fuel then you would have E=(1x0.4%).C²That will give us… 35,950,207,149,472,706 Joules or 3.5e+16 JoulesBut if you used let's say 30 tons of fuel. Then you would have E=(30,000x0.4%).C²And that would give us… 1,078,506,214,484,181,168,000 Joules or 1e+21 Joules.So as you can see a lot of energy all the same. More than enough to fuel our civilization endlessly. More so because over 70% of our planet is covered in water.Just in case you're wondering why none has delivered. That is because in order for a nuclear reactor to be profitable then it needs to put out more energy than the one we put in. That is called positive net energy. If you spend more energy than the one you get that is called negative net energy.And so far all fusion reactors only give us negative net energy.Why?! Because a lot of energy is lost in the form of fast moving neutrons that are extremely hard to contain, and also other forms of radiation/energy that escapes the containment field. All of that lost energy makes it so you need to continuously “pump” more energy into the reactor in order to keep the fusion reaction going.Are we close to a solution?! In here there is a lot of conflicting data.You'll see many projects say that we're less than a decade away from having viable nuclear fusion. But if you examine the hard data you'll see that they're working under two assumptions:That is what it's called working under assumptions. And assumptions aren't fact.So yes, they might find an answer in less than a decade or they might take a whole century to find it.That is why very rich tech savvies like Musk and others, want to develop an AI (artificial intelligence). Really because an AI would undoubtedly find the solution well within that time frame.Without an AI they'll have to work with best guess scenarios ran on supercomputers that not always work in the real world.

It’s a very simple idea. You just have a cylindrically symmetric column of plasma through which you drive a very large current. This current heats the plasma and it also creates a very large poloidal magnetic field circulating around the current. The ions and the electrons in the plasma are therefore confined by the action of the Lorentz force - which forces the charged particles to execute helical motion around the poloidal field lines. It seems on first blush very promising.But the Z-pinch has a big problem - because the plasma particles may drift towards the inside of the cylinder a bit, thus developing a kink. This causes the magnetic forces to get even larger, and the dynamics are such that such a small perturbation in the plasma distribution then grows with time. This is called the kink instability, and it prevents the Z-pinch from confining the plasma for long enough even to reach theoretical breakeven. There are some fusions produced, but nowhere near enough to make it worthwhile, and the plasma in fact very soon hits the walls of the container, which is very destructive.So attempts of various kinds were made to solve the kink instability. The first was simply to introduce a helical component of the magnetic field, which did in fact help greatly to help stabilize the kink. But ultimately this did not work either.The early stellarators in some way resemble the tokamak, but they also suffered from the same kink instability, and for a long time they were the dominant machines in the West. Meanwhile in the Soviet Union work started on the tokamaks.Both the stellarator and the tokamak involve curving the plasma completely around so that it forms, topologically, a solid torus. I won’t discuss the stellarator further, but you should certainly look into it too. The modern designs are greatly improved.The designers of the tokamak understood from the beginning that a helical magnetic field, one with both poloidal and vertical (toroidal) components would be needed to reduce the kink instability further. But what they realized was that there was a certain helical field ratio at which you would sufficiently reduce the kink instability to confine the plasma for a much longer time.The way that the tokamak works to reduce the kink instability, is that, because of the helical nature of the magnetic field as it winds around and through the torus, even though some particles circulating around flux surfaces at the inside of the torus may drift in across field lines towards regions of weaker field, which is the beginning of a kink formation, there are also particles circulating around flux lines on the same flux surface at the outside of the torus, and these are driven back out.So there are compensating effects as the plasma currents circulate around the torus.The problem is that there are many other instabilities too, that limit the duration and temperature and density of confinement, and these have not so far been solved.There is ITER, the new European Tokamak and there are some modern stellarators too, and there is inertial confinement fusion of various types. There are even ideas around to use a much improved version of the simple Z-pinch design.But so far, this is all for the future. None of it is yet working on a practical level.","7,483 followers",David Kahana,99,8.1K,16.6M,https://www.quora.com/When-will-Fusion-reactors-become-a-reality

Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s for a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.). Sadly, there has been frustratingly little payoff for all this MCF pure fusion effort as never once in over six decades of effort has any MCF fusion experiment produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds).MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power. ICF fusion worked and produced net energy from fusion from the very first experimental ICF fusion test (Ivy-Mike 1952).Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote equivalent funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). Halite-Centurion series underground test shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the underground test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed remotely some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has beenIf the public was comfortable in producing fusion energy in a succession of short fusion “bursts” instead of in a smooth continuous fusion burn; providing funding and committing National Lab design resources in a way comparable to MCF research, we could have with very low technical risk reliable ICF fusion power plants in a time frame that matters (proof of principal within 5 years - commercial ICF power plants in 10 years).",333 followers,Robert Steinhaus,99,329,699.7K,https://www.quora.com/When-will-Fusion-reactors-become-a-reality

It’s an indoor, radar air-trafﬁc control system for objects. Real air trafﬁc control systems are grim, complex bureaucracies, heavy with fail-safes. Who can make objects that integrate elegantly and dependably within an Internet of Things? Who can make that system as relatively simple and inviting as, say, the Internet’s Web browsers and Weblogs? It’s a design space rife with profound opportunity. You, a human being, don’t want the cognitive burden of knowing what your host of objects is doing all the time. What you want is the executive brieﬁng. Management has its perks as well as its burdens. The drawback of becoming a Wrangler is a ceaseless struggle through changing ﬁelds of data and relationships. The beneﬁt is that many previously knotty problems simply vaporize, they become trivial. The primary advantage of an Internet of Things is that I no longer inventory my possessions inside my own head. They’re inventoried through an auto-magical inventory voodoo, work done far beneath my notice by a host of machines. I no longer bother to remember where I put things. Or where I found them. Or how much they cost. And so forth. I just ask. Then I am told with instant real-time accuracy.I have an Internet of Things with a search engine. So I no longer hunt anxiously for my missing shoes in the morning. I just Google them. As long as machines can crunch the complexities, their interfaces make my relationship to objects feel much simpler and more immediate. I am at ease in materiality in a way that people never were before. Although I live in a much cleaner way than my forebears did, I am not achingly burdened by glum moral guilt about my acts of consumption. That’s no longer a burdensome matter requiring constant conscientious decision-making on my own part. Instead, it’s been designed into the metrics of the production stream. Whenever I shop, I shop with a wand in my hand. It would never occur to me to shop without a ﬁlter and an interface. And someone built that for me, it was designed—as a Wrangler, I need an interface for capitalism itself. In the old days, the best term for an idea like that was probably a “lifestyle magazine.” Those toney, glossy little empires were the native haunts of the design profession. But those things were made of paper. They just sat there on a table. They couldn’t do anything. But now that design decisions are at my ﬁngertips instead of stuck on paper, I can do a lot.b)Analysts predict that new Internet of Things(IoT) product sand services will grow exponentially in the coming years. I ﬁrmly believe that the Commission will continue to support research in IoT in Horizon 2020, the forthcoming EU research and innovation framework program starting in 2014.In order to enable a fast uptake of the IoT, key issues like identiﬁcation, privacy and security and semantic inter operable routes have to be tackled. The interplay with cloud technologies, big data and future networks like 5G have also to be taken into account. Open and integrated IoT environments will boost the competitiveness of European SMEs and make people’s daily life easier. For instance, it will be easier for patients to receive continuous care and for companies to efﬁciently source components for their products. This will lead to better services, huge savings and a smarter use of resources. To achieve these promising results, I think it is vital to enhance users’ trust in the Internet of Things. The data protection legislation and the cyber security strategy proposed by the European Commission clearly go in this direction.Credits:",50 followers,Nelson Paulose,9,68,225.4K,https://www.quora.com/In-future-IOT-Internet-of-things-is-trending-technology-or-not

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend.

529,"In 10–30 years the world would be much different.Technology:In 10–30 years the world would be much different.Technology:Genetics will improve and medicine will advance tremendously in a way life expectancy will grow dramatically.Climate change:A. Technologically, companies will continue to develop clean forms of energy despite the fact low oil and coal price. Companies such as Tesla will become new Exxon Mobile or Ford. Private citizens will act in order to support companies to develop clean energy through crowdfunding which will be one perhaps the most used form of finance.These efforts will be directed to India whereaprox. 300 million people will move from rural areas to urban, Brazil, South Africa, the United States, Russia (or what will be there after Russia), China (a lot of small regions, not today’s China).The idea is that in the next 10 years people and companies will act with visionary politicians such as Modi, Peña Nieto, Macron, Trudeau to promote clean energy around the globe.Geopolitics:Russia will collapse in the same way the Soviet Union collapsed. USSR collapsed when their defense budget was highly increased and when oil price was low. Now, in 2017 we have exact the same conditions. After all, Vladimir Putin is in charge since 2000. The last generation doesn’t know another political leader than Putin. They will act in the same way Egyptian people acted in 2011. Yes, there will be a Russian Spring, not in 10 years but in less than 3. In 10 years there will be a lot of small states.China will implode in a less centralized government. The gap between regions and rich-poor people is too high to be ignored. Chinese regions will act independently according to their economic interests.Japan may solve its demographic crisis using robots for manufacturing. Immigrants will not invade Japan in the next 10 years. Japan will reconquer its lost territories from Russia and will dominate China once again.With a low oil price, Saudi Arabia will no longer exist as a state. They currently implemented Strategy 2030, a national strategy to diversify Saudi economy. But because of its religious influence and social structure, it is too late to act. A good example in diversifying an oil based economy is the United Arab Emirates that will become a financial hub, an educational world center and perhaps a technological power.South America will grow if it will remain stable. This region will develop tremendously. With a lack of external threats and lack of internal rivalry, those countries will form an effective economic bloc. The new generation of politicians will fight against corruption and organized crime. In the next 10–30 years we will talk about “The Mexican Model” which will be exported to Central and South America. Current Mexican president is a reformist who is fighting to stabilize the country and eliminate drug cartels. Mexico has an enormous potential to develop due to its ocean coastlines, natural resources, and workforce.The United States has to turn back being the world leader. Trump’s approach on international relation is very similar to China foreign policy: bilateral negotiations, zero-sum game, isolationism. I expect only 4 years of Trump, then I expect a left-wing president such as Bernie Sanders. The reason is young people are involved in the social debate and they are willing to promote the values such as universal free education and healthcare, equality of chances. In the same way, the future generation of European will act to establish a fiscal union, in the US next generation will act to introduce free access to education and healthcare. Due to the technological and financial development, we could expect a success.African continent will transform itself dramatically. Countries such as Nigeria will become the new china while Chinese provinces will develop themselves in the same way Japan did. Africa is very unpredictable because of its lack of political institutions. The political risk of investment in Africa is too high now. The only way to change this is towards political approach. African states need stable institutions, efficient governance and fair justice system.Social:Risks:",310 followers,Alexander Von Stauffenberg,9,121,715.3K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

But one sized for direct implant will be on the drawing boards and in testing. Any desired task will be engaged by ""thinking it,"" such as, ""Call Mary."" Phone calls, internet connections, software applications, banking, trading stocks -anything now done on a computer or smart phone will be done ""in your head."" Visualization will be accomplished by stimulus of the visual cortex, such that images are displayed inside the eye, but appear to ""float"" before the user, like the heads-up display used by a fighter pilot; an improvement on Google ""glass.""Storage and some processing will take place in a small appliance about the size of a deck of cards, carried in a pocket or in a small holster attached at any convenient place. It will communicate wirelessly with the headband. In addition, every user will be a ""hot spot"" to enable a massively redundant and universally accessible network. Portions of the brain itself will act as network attached storage. ""Forgetting"" will be a thing of the past, as the processor will catalog the content of human memory by constant scanning and analysis of the material as it may appear in conscious and subconscious thought patterns, dreaming, etc. Merely ""trying"" to remember will fire the neural network which will synchronize with device storage to tell you why you DID just walk into the kitchen.The concept of ""cloud"" computing will be replaced with ""fog"" computing, as we all operate more within the cloud itself, which is established by the network of devices in proximity to one another and with access nodes which are everywhere. In remote or isolated situations, the system will operate only within itself, whilst it constantly searches for signals.Bulk data streams (the internet, for example) will be distributed by light from LEDs which will be common sources of illumination everywhere. These will ""blink"" at a visually imperceptible rate so as to communicate data in much the same way as fibre optic cables. Want an internet connection? Turn on a light. See a demonstration here:Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi InternetSocial implications will be especially notable, because users may establish beacons to communicate their social status. Thus, for example, strangers in search of romance (for even just a few hours) might set a ""beacon"" to broadcast their availability, personal data, desires and intent automatically. Those doing so are alerted whenever a ""match"" occurs. This is already anticipated by apps such as ""Tinder,"" but a beacon will work automatically.Anonymity and security are based on a combination of DNA, a ""Passthought,"" a physical gesture and spoken word or phrase.Other current developments will blossom under this new technology. Uber, for example, may be summoned by simply ""thinking"" for a ride. The nearest available ride will be directed to you.The system will also allow for the elimination of credit cards and similar transaction mediums. PayPal (or its descendants) will capitalize on this. To buy anything, anywhere, just ""think it."" The money is transferred in real time. But such decisions will be coupled with a deliberate act to verify, such as recitation of a string of characters out loud or whistling a measure of notes.  At a physical store, buyers simply walk out with their merchandise in hand. ""Clerks"" merely standby to answer door alarms when any item not thought-bought passes through a detector.Systems will also scan user's biological and mental functioning so as to recommend meal choices, produce an alert if blood chemistry detects a problem or some other indicator suggests an intervention is in order. In emergency medical situations, the system will do a data dump to first responders to suggest what immediate medical treatment is recommended.More and more vehicular transportation will be self-working. People need no longer ""own"" cars, they simply have access to them by subscription. Need a van to carry goods and kids? Think for one.

This is a primary factor for futurists. Whilst such a high population may cause problems not seen before in human history, the ability to feed and hydrate such a population will actually increase beyond our current capability, which will result in a higher percentage of average wellbeing.Poverty as such will not be eradicated but many aspects about how we measure economic welfare will be adjusteIn some ways it will be similar to the world we are in now, and of course nothing is certain but the following view stems from a high probability calculation:There will be ~9.5B people living on Earth. This is a primary factor for futurists. Whilst such a high population may cause problems not seen before in human history, the ability to feed and hydrate such a population will actually increase beyond our current capability, which will result in a higher percentage of average wellbeing.Poverty as such will not be eradicated but many aspects about how we measure economic welfare will be adjusted. New measurements will take into account the balance of work injected vs salary garnered and not just salary. Poverty measurements will also include other socio economic elements such as available time. Today’s time-poor individuals will be classified as living in ‘poverty’ by 2050 standardised models.There will be an increase in overall globalisation. More individuals will be speaking English as their first language, and a much greater number than today will be speaking English as their second language. Estimates include that 70–80% of China will be fluent in English as a first or second language. Commonality of language improves international relationships and trade.A rise in education and literacy standards will improve the economies and the geo-political aspects of nations with high economic growth rates. There will be a new set of countries that will replace today’s BRIC countries as the ones to watch; Most of which will be in Africa with perhaps Peru being included.The UN may establish a second security council and label it something like “The UN Energy and Economic Security Council” which will have more member nations. Energy production will increase and solar energy will become the worlds primary energy source. The amount of regions in conflict will reduce though there will not be a complete absence of war.The nature of work will be impacted the most. What we do, the hours per day, the days per week will all change. The sense of a tangible global economy will emerge and the nature of people’s “energy” input and “value” output will drive completely new lifestyles. Countries with large amounts of land but with a small population like Canada, Australia, and Mongolia will adapt the quickest, and provide a model for others to replicate and improve upon. In many ways China has gone through this revolution since the mid-’90s. China and now many others will have to undergo this new change .The language of global software and hardware systems will become simplified to a point where most individuals will be able to manipulate parameters of systems to derive different and more customised outcomes. The idea of appliances will diminish as we move to an ecosystem of convergeable components.There will be a rise in global identity which will reduce the idea of nation-states. Existing large global “diasporas” will be a model for humans identifying themselves as global citizens whilst still embodying the history and traditions of their heritage and culture. The idea of multi-cultural cohabitation will find its way into even very small cities and townships all over the globe.Privatised space programs will become more commercially oriented as our sights turn to the Moon and the riches that can be found there. There will be at least a couple of automated mining & refining platforms sent to the moon and one or two of the larger asteroids. The first orbital hotel may be built by materials sent from the Moon as it would be more economical than lifting materials from Earth.General overall increases in wellbeing amongst the global population, coupled with the advancements made in medicine will see average life spans increase. Though the idea of living to 90 and even 100 will become more commonplace, there will not be an equivalent rise in people having great-grandchildren. Most diseases will either be cured or be clinically manageable. One area where there is expected to be a high amount of growth in preventative medicine research will be in the area of agriculture; enhancing the medicinal benefits of the food items in our diet, and bacteria; there will be a high degree of human designed good-bacteria that will maintain a highly efficient gastro-intestinal tract and integumentary system.All in all, a person born anywhere in the world today will have a high probability of being fluent in English, interacting with a large group of people all over the world, for professional and personal reasons, and by their mid-30s will have travelled to Africa at least once, will have done 10 different things as a source of income of which 3 will still be used, will be asked to perform tasks that are related to very large multi-generation projects like desert reclamation or orbital infrastructure construction for which the “reward” will be social credit that they will be able to pass on to their children or grandchildren. They will have the opportunity to explore more of the Earth, and even in a small city in the Amazon they will be able to find good Thai food.",200 followers,Eddie Cejvan,99,1.1K,954.9K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

The Soviet Union had a huge army which was not actually needed because at that time, the Soviet Union and the United States could destroy each other more than eight times over with the use of nuclear weapons. You don't need to destroy another country eight times over. This was a waste of resources.It also wasted a huge amount of resources on its foreign policy adventures, like in Afghanistan and many other places, while its economy at home was very ineffective.I think what President Putin meant was that the United States is also over-stretching its resources. It has a lot of unnecessary things that it pays for, for example, it has bases in many countries of the world. It also has a lot of problems at home. There is a very deep division between political camps in the US. What's more important is that the US is pursuing some policies which harm its economy in favor of ideology.The US is becoming increasingly ideological, just like the Soviet Union. The US now has this policy of fighting racism, which is not actually fighting racism but introducing reverse racism. In effect, there are already many rules in the United States where you give some quotas or privileges and employment for various groups of supposedly oppressed people, not on the basis of their merit, but on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. This is very like the Soviet Union, because in the Soviet Union, only there, during the time of my youth the privileges were given not on the basis of race, but on the basis of social background or ethnicity. If you want an effective economy, you need to hire people based on their merits, but not on other factors.I think what President Putin meant is not that the US is going to collapse very soon but that it has a lot of problems which, for ideological reasons, it is not even trying to address, and this reminds him of the Soviet Union.

These languages will be as useful as Latin!Self-driving cars will be everywhere. Only people like Jay Leno will still be driving cars just for fun or recreation. But not on the roads! Rather, they’ll do it in private venues.They’ll even have self-flying aircraft. I’ve seen it with my own eyes! Boeing and Airbus will be the largest manufacturers of self-flying airliners that seat 500 passengers. To be honest, that made me nervous.I saw the first instances of automonous police robots. They were scary as shit ‘cuz these bipedal machines were armed with dual machine guns on a body turret!

But, as Professor Brian Cox pointed out a few years ago, we spend more on ring-tones than on research into nuclear fusion.However, some think that mimicking how the Sun works is not going to be achieved by over-budget attempts like the ITER in France or the Lawrence Livermore project in the USA, but by smaller-scale attempts. Cue a round of investment in smaller firms, most notably Amazon's Jeff Bezos backing General Fusion's attempts.2.With resources under pressure and key metals already scarce or uneconomical to extract, one solution is to reach for the stars. Planetary Resources wants to do just that – the first step in its hugely expensive, expansive plan is to begin what it calls the ARKYD Series of robotic space missions to identify the most commercially viable near-Earth asteroids.Precious metals and water – the latter crucial for the space missions themselves – are the prizes, though the very first mission involves the launch in two years of the ARKYD 'public space telescope' that will be used for myriad education purposes. However, its main task is to identify the closest asteroids worth mining.Seasteading is about creating experimental communities away from government control3.Just as the elevator made the vertical city possible, is living on water the next phase of urbanisation? It might have to be. With sea levels predicted to rise by 20-30cm by 2050, cities from New York and Bangkok to Guangzhou and Mumbai will experience increased flooding, while some island chains will be inundated, rendered uninhabitable. Could constructing floating communities be the answer?Cue the Floating City Project from the Seasteading Institute, a non-profit organisation that wants to establish floating cities primarily for experimentation beyond the restrictions of normal society. Designed to allow 'the next generation of pioneers to test new ideas for government', the organisation plans to approach governments of coastal nations to host an autonomous offshore community, or seastead.2050 will see a doubling in demand for electricity4.The smart gridGlobal energy consumption is increasing by about 2% ever year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which together with predicted population increase means a doubling of demand by 2050. Smart meters that communicate with smart grids are already popping up across the world, with fully automated smart grids eventually able to directly tie energy production to real-time demand.The end-game is a reduction in peak and off-peak production, partially by adjusting the cost of a kilowatt hour according to the time of day.There will be 100 million electric cars by 20505.At the heart of the drive to make grids more modern, smarter and better able to cope with increasing demand is the spectre of electric vehicles. If every driver in the UK will need to plug in their car each night – and perhaps even top-up during the day, too – the national grid is going to come under much more pressure than it does today.What's holding back the concept of electric vehicles is 'range anxiety', which comes from the core problem; battery technology badly needs some 'emerging technology', though Bosch thinks it's got the stop-gap sorted.Humans will need 80% more meat by 20506. Food of the futureWith the world's growing middle class already wanting to eat more meat, and with demand for flesh and protein expected to increase by as much as 80% by 2050, humanity's eating habits will have to change if we're to avoid a 'protein deficit' in the future.Cue cultured 'beef' burgers. The first example of in-vitro meat was made a few years ago from muscle cells taken from a cowGraphene could mean super-high buildings and even a space elevator7. GrapheneIt's been hailed as a miracle material. Discovered and produced by Konstantin Novoselow and Andre Geim at the University of Manchester in 2004 – who got a Nobel Prize for the trouble – graphene could mean super-efficient high-speed computing, flexible and super-thin gadgets, increased battery life by a factor of ten, and it could enable photovoltaic paint for solar power from any surface, and printable sensors along with tracking tags.Near-transparent sheets of carbon graphite molecules just one atom in thickness, graphene sheets are described as 'chicken wire made of carbon atoms' and are reckoned to be so strong that ribbons of graphene could enable super-high buildings – and even a space elevator.The Maglev will barrel along at 310mph8.Who wants mere bullet trains when you can have an ultra-high-speed superconducting 'floating' train system? Japan's JR Central train company is aiming to cut the journey time from Tokyo's Shinagawa Station to Nagoya in half by using its new magnetic levitation train.Powerful superconducting electromagnets above and below the track propel the train upwards (by about 10cm) and forwards, with the lack of friction meaning much faster speeds, even on steep slopes.Known as the L0 Series, it will travel at 310mph and connect the two cities in 40 minutes (it currently takes 90 minutes on a Shinkansen bullet train). It won't go into service until 2027, though there are plans to extend the line to Osaka by 2045.Get ready for green buildings that generate solar heat and collect water9.Buildings with integral trees and plants are the next big thing in architecture, and no vision of the world of the future is without skyscrapers draped in vegetation and rooftops thronged with trees.Milan's twin-tower Bosco Verticale is a real-life example of how peoples' desire to live in a dense urban environment and also be surrounded by vegetation can be achieved. Around 11,000 plants, 5,000 shrubs, and over 700 trees can be found within this revolutionary residential tower block, which architect Boeri Studio calls a ""device for the environmental survival of contemporary European cities"".Bosco Verticale is not just about reintroducing trees into urban settings. Recycled water is used to water the plants and trees, while the cladding of the building itself features integrated solar panels to provide energy.If it gets too crowded, the only option may be to bail on Planet Earth10.Electric propulsionMay saw arguably one of humanity's biggest tech breakthroughs when the Dawn probe reached the dwarf planet Ceres. Launched by NASA in 2007, Dawn is the first mission to use an electrically-powered ion engine rather than conventional chemical rockets.Its Xenon Ion Drive makes better use of fuel by accelerating it to a velocity ten times as fast as chemical rockets, which saves on mass. It's exactly this kind of (solar-powered) electric propulsion that will make long-distance space missions possible, but since xenon gas is massively scarce, the search is on for other propellants. Cue missions to Mars, and a potential way off our increasingly crowded planet.",206 followers,Abhishek Purohit,9,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years

Telephony will become a nonverbal technology, free from the techniques of the language, civilization, sin, time, and distance. All of which were invented by primitive-humans within the last 6,000 years.The new telephonic system is still in the R&D stage in scientific technology. It is used experimentally in mainstream technology of civilization. Telephonic communication is a common occurrence and considered a normal-natural part of life. For lack of a “name,” it is like telepathy, metaphysics, religion, dreams.

We've come a long way from colorless television sets and sending humans to the moon. These days we're launching self-driving cars or AI(Artificial Intelligence) gadgets.It is tough to make predictions about future. Still we can foresee tackling and solving many problems human and society facing today.

Knowing the right people is key.This is even more true in company settings where hiring is being done by HR/recruitment personel who are hired for their “people skills” but frequently lack a lot of the actual job-related skills.I’ll give you an example of what happened at my workplace. (Callcenter - specific project for a local ISP)Coworker of mine who is quite competent wanted to pursue an advancement track for agents to become supervisor. The person in charge of hiring not only turned him down because they thought he was “too junior”, but recommended him to take pointers from another coworker.Said coworker (someone who talks a good game but that’s really about it) totally failed their assessment.The business unit manager heard that the competent guy was turned down and insisted he be given a chance. They had to pull some strings and specifically tell them they allow him to take the assessment.Not only did he pass the assessment - he did better than just about anyone they’ve seen in the past half decade or more. And requested if they could use his stuff as reference material to showcase for future candidates and so on.So to recap:It doesn’t matter how skilled or competent you are if you don’t make good first impressions, don’t talk a good game and/or don’t know the right people to pull strings for you.",0 followers,David Burston,0,588,290.2K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-solutions-to-emerging-issues-in-communication

When students are used to getting information instantly and in a format that they are comfortable with, the thought of transitioning to traditional methods may seem daunting.2) Another common disadvantage of technology in education is its tendency to reduce human interaction among students. Instead of interacting with one another, students tend to rely on technology as their primary form of communication and collaboration. This can be detrimental to important skills such as developing social and emotional intelligence.3) Finally, the use of technology in education can also lead to a lack of critical thinking skills. Because information is so readily available and often presented in a simplified format, students may be less inclined to analyse or question the validity of what they are learning. This can lead to misconceptions about important concepts or a general misunderstanding of the material.While there are certainly some disadvantages to using technology in education, there are also many potential benefits. When used correctly, technology can be a powerful tool for enhancing learning and increasing engagement.

But in a world of imperfections, even the best of intentions, one way or another, will have negative repercussions. This answer aims to establish both the negative and positive effects of technology and its advancement on education and, if possible, ramifications to rectify the damages we are experiencing in the millennial generation.So, here are some positive effects of technology on education:1. Facilitates learningWitOver the years, technology was being infused into every aspect of life such as health, infrastructure, and education, to mention a few. And it began showing promising results. But in a world of imperfections, even the best of intentions, one way or another, will have negative repercussions. This answer aims to establish both the negative and positive effects of technology and its advancement on education and, if possible, ramifications to rectify the damages we are experiencing in the millennial generation.So, here are some positive effects of technology on education:1. Facilitates learningWith the advent of gadgets like phones and tablets, students are able to get instant access to information which makes it easier for them to study. With the help of the internet, students are able to complete project works and assignments from school faster and more efficiently. This is one of the intended positive effects of technology on students. Among other benefits, in this time and age, students can simply turn to a custom service with a “do my homework for me” request and rid themselves of having to deal with the stress of education.2. Contributes to teachingIn recent times, the arrival of smart boards has improved the teaching quality in schools. These boards help teachers present limitless information to facilitate students understanding the topic. They also offer teachers access to Microsoft PowerPoint and other amazing software for teaching.3. Develops the minds of studentsThe brain is the most useful asset of any person. It works in such a way that, the more you use it, the more you improve in what you are using it for. In other words, technology helps to develop the minds of students through access to a limitless ocean of information on the internet.Now take a look at the negative effects of technology on education:1. Kills student creativityAlthough the availability of limitless information on the internet serves as a great learning tool, it can also kill the creativity. Students sometimes just copy and paste the information in order to get good grades.2. DistractionsInstead of studying, students spend most of the time on social media sites and television shows. These days social media has become an addiction for most students to the point where they prefer staying on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, or Twitter while in class instead of focusing on what’s being taught.3. MisinformationAlthough information is limitless on the Internet, there is no guarantee that what students are consuming is what they need. Anybody can post anything on the Internet, and it presents as extremely difficult to determine what is the truth and what is just a clout-chasing piece of misinformation.In conclusion, all parental figures, as well as school authorities, should take necessary precautions to ensure that students are using technology the right way. In time, the negative effects will be minimized if not eradicated totally, giving room for students to benefit fully from technology.I hope your query is resolved by now.
