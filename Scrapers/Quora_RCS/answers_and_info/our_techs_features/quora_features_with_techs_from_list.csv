We have the technology today but the energy costs are extreme.Cheap clean energy changes everything and simplyTravel to space will be somewhat routine thanks to a space elevator and/or nuclear rockets. Both technologies need one scientific breakthrough and then a bunch of engineering. The main problem will be that there isn't actually all that much reason for most people to go to space: science, tourism, satellite maintenance, perhaps a bit of asteroid mining. Humanity will launch the first interstellar probes and generally begin considering interstellar travel.There will be a small colony on Mars similar to today's on Antarctica, mostly for research, and to satisfy the human desire to explore. You'll be able to visit, but the price will be incredible and few people will do so.AI will be roughly as smart as humans, and robots will do most of the jobs humans do today. Most things will be very cheap, but only high end engineers and artists will be able to find work. A basic income policy will have been introduced long before, and it will support most of the population. By 50 years from now this will seem perfectly normal. The few people who work will get benefits like waterfront homes and private resorts, along with extreme prestige. (This is the utopian version. I also have a dystopian version, but I'm in a good mood today.)Entertainment will be fully immersive. You won't be able to tell it's not real. You might even be able to erase the memory that you're in a program, so that you think you're really there. Maybe you're in a program right now and don't even know it. Say hi to the robots for me when you wake up.","45,199 followers",David Seidman,999,3.6K,82.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years,Hyperloop

But one sized for direct implant will be on the drawing boards and in testing. Any desired task will be engaged by ""thinking it,"" such as, ""Call Mary."" Phone calls, internet connections, software applications, banking, trading stocks -anything now done on a computer or smart phone will be done ""in your head."" Visualization will be accomplished by stimulus of the visual cortex, such that images are displayed inside the eye, but appear to ""float"" before the user, like the heads-up display used by a fighter pilot; an improvement on Google ""glass.""Storage and some processing will take place in a small appliance about the size of a deck of cards, carried in a pocket or in a small holster attached at any convenient place. It will communicate wirelessly with the headband. In addition, every user will be a ""hot spot"" to enable a massively redundant and universally accessible network. Portions of the brain itself will act as network attached storage. ""Forgetting"" will be a thing of the past, as the processor will catalog the content of human memory by constant scanning and analysis of the material as it may appear in conscious and subconscious thought patterns, dreaming, etc. Merely ""trying"" to remember will fire the neural network which will synchronize with device storage to tell you why you DID just walk into the kitchen.The concept of ""cloud"" computing will be replaced with ""fog"" computing, as we all operate more within the cloud itself, which is established by the network of devices in proximity to one another and with access nodes which are everywhere. In remote or isolated situations, the system will operate only within itself, whilst it constantly searches for signals.Bulk data streams (the internet, for example) will be distributed by light from LEDs which will be common sources of illumination everywhere. These will ""blink"" at a visually imperceptible rate so as to communicate data in much the same way as fibre optic cables. Want an internet connection? Turn on a light. See a demonstration here:Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi InternetSocial implications will be especially notable, because users may establish beacons to communicate their social status. Thus, for example, strangers in search of romance (for even just a few hours) might set a ""beacon"" to broadcast their availability, personal data, desires and intent automatically. Those doing so are alerted whenever a ""match"" occurs. This is already anticipated by apps such as ""Tinder,"" but a beacon will work automatically.Anonymity and security are based on a combination of DNA, a ""Passthought,"" a physical gesture and spoken word or phrase.Other current developments will blossom under this new technology. Uber, for example, may be summoned by simply ""thinking"" for a ride. The nearest available ride will be directed to you.The system will also allow for the elimination of credit cards and similar transaction mediums. PayPal (or its descendants) will capitalize on this. To buy anything, anywhere, just ""think it."" The money is transferred in real time. But such decisions will be coupled with a deliberate act to verify, such as recitation of a string of characters out loud or whistling a measure of notes.  At a physical store, buyers simply walk out with their merchandise in hand. ""Clerks"" merely standby to answer door alarms when any item not thought-bought passes through a detector.Systems will also scan user's biological and mental functioning so as to recommend meal choices, produce an alert if blood chemistry detects a problem or some other indicator suggests an intervention is in order. In emergency medical situations, the system will do a data dump to first responders to suggest what immediate medical treatment is recommended.More and more vehicular transportation will be self-working. People need no longer ""own"" cars, they simply have access to them by subscription. Need a van to carry goods and kids? Think for one. It will appear in a few minutes.And that's just for starters....","9,531 followers",John Geare,9,13.6K,48.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years,cloud
28,"In some ways it will be similar to the world we are in now, and of course nothing is certain but the following view stems from a high probability calculation:There will be ~9.5B people living on Earth. This is a primary factor for futurists. Whilst such a high population may cause problems not seen before in human history, the ability to feed and hydrate such a population will actually increase beyond our current capability, which will result in a higher percentage of average wellbeing.Poverty as such will not be eradicated but many aspects about how we measure economic welfare will be adjusteIn some ways it will be similar to the world we are in now, and of course nothing is certain but the following view stems from a high probability calculation:There will be ~9.5B people living on Earth. This is a primary factor for futurists. Whilst such a high population may cause problems not seen before in human history, the ability to feed and hydrate such a population will actually increase beyond our current capability, which will result in a higher percentage of average wellbeing.Poverty as such will not be eradicated but many aspects about how we measure economic welfare will be adjusted. New measurements will take into account the balance of work injected vs salary garnered and not just salary. Poverty measurements will also include other socio economic elements such as available time. Today‚Äôs time-poor individuals will be classified as living in ‚Äòpoverty‚Äô by 2050 standardised models.There will be an increase in overall globalisation. More individuals will be speaking English as their first language, and a much greater number than today will be speaking English as their second language. Estimates include that 70‚Äì80% of China will be fluent in English as a first or second language. Commonality of language improves international relationships and trade.A rise in education and literacy standards will improve the economies and the geo-political aspects of nations with high economic growth rates. There will be a new set of countries that will replace today‚Äôs BRIC countries as the ones to watch; Most of which will be in Africa with perhaps Peru being included.The UN may establish a second security council and label it something like ‚ÄúThe UN Energy and Economic Security Council‚Äù which will have more member nations. Energy production will increase and solar energy will become the worlds primary energy source. The amount of regions in conflict will reduce though there will not be a complete absence of war.The nature of work will be impacted the most. What we do, the hours per day, the days per week will all change. The sense of a tangible global economy will emerge and the nature of people‚Äôs ‚Äúenergy‚Äù input and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù output will drive completely new lifestyles. Countries with large amounts of land but with a small population like Canada, Australia, and Mongolia will adapt the quickest, and provide a model for others to replicate and improve upon. In many ways China has gone through this revolution since the mid-‚Äô90s. China and now many others will have to undergo this new change .The language of global software and hardware systems will become simplified to a point where most individuals will be able to manipulate parameters of systems to derive different and more customised outcomes. The idea of appliances will diminish as we move to an ecosystem of convergeable components.There will be a rise in global identity which will reduce the idea of nation-states. Existing large global ‚Äúdiasporas‚Äù will be a model for humans identifying themselves as global citizens whilst still embodying the history and traditions of their heritage and culture. The idea of multi-cultural cohabitation will find its way into even very small cities and townships all over the globe.Privatised space programs will become more commercially oriented as our sights turn to the Moon and the riches that can be found there. There will be at least a couple of automated mining & refining platforms sent to the moon and one or two of the larger asteroids. The first orbital hotel may be built by materials sent from the Moon as it would be more economical than lifting materials from Earth.General overall increases in wellbeing amongst the global population, coupled with the advancements made in medicine will see average life spans increase. Though the idea of living to 90 and even 100 will become more commonplace, there will not be an equivalent rise in people having great-grandchildren. Most diseases will either be cured or be clinically manageable. One area where there is expected to be a high amount of growth in preventative medicine research will be in the area of agriculture; enhancing the medicinal benefits of the food items in our diet, and bacteria; there will be a high degree of human designed good-bacteria that will maintain a highly efficient gastro-intestinal tract and integumentary system.All in all, a person born anywhere in the world today will have a high probability of being fluent in English, interacting with a large group of people all over the world, for professional and personal reasons, and by their mid-30s will have travelled to Africa at least once, will have done 10 different things as a source of income of which 3 will still be used, will be asked to perform tasks that are related to very large multi-generation projects like desert reclamation or orbital infrastructure construction for which the ‚Äúreward‚Äù will be social credit that they will be able to pass on to their children or grandchildren. They will have the opportunity to explore more of the Earth, and even in a small city in the Amazon they will be able to find good Thai food.",200 followers,Eddie Cejvan,99,1.1K,954.9K,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years,Li-Fi

The question, ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs next‚Äô is a constant in a tech geek‚Äôs professional life. When it comes to technology, there is always something fresh and the hunt to develop and implement a new technology that could augment businesses is unyielding. The inquisitiveness to know and seek knowledge about the technology and how it is going to impact the daily lives of the human species.Technology is true, one of the greatest change agents in the present world, and is moving faster than ever before. It has the supremacy to offer innovative solutions to global challenges. The emerging technologies have brought a radical shift in the information, technology and development sector and thereby impacting the other industries along with sales and marketing business segments well. Mapping the imminent technology proposal of the business demands the business leaders to first identify these emerging technology trends. They ought to learn the dynamics of the technology and how it would impact the present and the future of the business.Here are some of the most revolutionary and disruptive emerging technologies:Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have taken huge leaps in the recent past few years. For example, a business can apply machine learning and offer the consumer a fresh purchasing option, depending on the analysis of the history of the purchasing pattern and taste of the consumer. Machine Learning could be an effective tool for cyber financial frauds. Artificial Intelligence could be a more robust system to combat the new complex cyber-attacks. The ML and AI technologies blend a variety of other skills and expertise such as neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing. This also includes other statistical concepts to appreciate, learn, forecast, acclimate and potentially function autonomously.Internet of Things (IoT)IoT is seen as the change agent for the luxurious and effective lifestyle for the consumers, offering valuable customer interactions and exceptional experiences for them. IoT is one of the most exciting areas of focus today. The idea revolves around the nano-sensors circulating in the human body or any specific object. Once connected with the technology, this is going to have a proliferating impact on the various sectors such as medicine, agriculture, architecture etc.Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain Technology is the disruptor of the Financial Industry. Mostly espoused by the cryptocurrency industry, today, even the conventional banks have started to clout its usage. The rise of bitcoin industry has raised the ambiguous inquisitiveness of the blockchain technology affecting the emerging markets. The blockchain technology is a digital principled ledger which creates numerous chained blocks of data and ensures sales and marketing resources are focused on the numbers of the business.Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)The fascinating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is the current catchphrase of every technocrat. The AR and VR are potentially remodelling the way consumers interact with each other and the technology, inspiring the growth of pervasive settings. For instance, AR allows the user to blend the real and virtual world. With the help of VR technology, firms can deploy virtual business training and remote involvement. . The technology is also helpful to know in-depth about the changing tastes of the target audience and has immense potential to influence the business strategies.Big DataBig data technology is a very simple and effective concept. An exceptional method to collect, organise and comprehend the data for the benefit of the business. The quantitative output of data-driven analysis is one of the core strengths of big data technology. The Big data technology involves building huge data architectures to organise and analyze the unstructured data and offer real-time value for the business. The vast augmentation of the digital data has enabled not just big, but also the small and medium enterprises to disrupt the power of big-data. This technology with the right expertise would help the business to lower the cost of consumer gaining, augment sales and step into new business markets.Market AutomationEvery entrepreneur and business tycoon must be aware that marketing automation is here to stay. In the present-day scenario, sales and marketing personnel must automate processes in every way possible to offer the best experiences for the consumers. Businesses must leverage the benefits of this exclusive technology to eradicate the human-exclusive tasks. A robust automation tool is tailored to the explicit requirements of the business.The online e-commerce leverages the best of automation technology. An e-commerce industry can use automation technology to understand the customer‚Äôs buying cycle and share the right message at the right time. For example, if he or she has left the shopping cart without making a purchase.Cloud ComputingThe market forecast states that in the next five years, 50% of the business organisations and global companies are moving their data to the cloud. This also points that Cloud Computing Technology companies such as Microsoft have greater responsibility to safeguard and secure the consumer valuable data. In the healthcare sector, operations and medical organisations can maintain the patient data, check the status of the patient and offer necessary treatments as and when necessary, without storing the data in the hardcopy of files.Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",UNKNOWN,Al Klein,9,84.3K,60.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025,VR

The device uses infrared to see in the dark at night when the floodlight is off.From a design perspective, the Presence looks more like a standard issue outdoor flood light than a security camera, which is a good way to trick any would-be wrongdoers. I'm not in love with the design, which is a little blocky for my taste, though ultimately the minimal aluminum build is pretty inoffensive. It's rated IP66 to withstand harsh outdoor conditions, like ice, rain, sun, and wind.The camera records full HD 1080p video. It has a 100-degree field of view, and a very impressive 65-foot detection range (many outdoor cameras provide a range closer to 25 feet). There's also infrared night vision, and Netatmo uses end-to-end encryption to make sure no one else can access your camera feed.Check out :Storage -Hybrid cloud storageIt is a combination of public cloud storage and private cloud storage where some critical data resides in the enterprise's private cloud while other data is stored and accessible from a public cloud storage provider started byWith hybrid cloud storage, enterprises are able to mix and match cloud storage resources between local data center infrastructure and scalable, on-demand infrastructure, with the cloud storage provider typically fully managing the cloud storage.Hybrid cloud storage combines the advantages of scalability, reliability, rapid deployment and potential cost savings of public cloud storage with the security and full control of private cloud storage.Hybrid cloud storage more accurately means using on-premise storage and storage in the public cloud to create a greater overall value ‚Äì as a kind of mash-up.

But one sized for direct implant will be on the drawing boards and in testing. Any desired task will be engaged by ""thinking it,"" such as, ""Call Mary."" Phone calls, internet connections, software applications, banking, trading stocks -anything now done on a computer or smart phone will be done ""in your head."" Visualization will be accomplished by stimulus of the visual cortex, such that images are displayed inside the eye, but appear to ""float"" before the user, like the heads-up display used by a fighter pilot; an improvement on Google ""glass.""Storage and some processing will take place in a small appliance about the size of a deck of cards, carried in a pocket or in a small holster attached at any convenient place. It will communicate wirelessly with the headband. In addition, every user will be a ""hot spot"" to enable a massively redundant and universally accessible network. Portions of the brain itself will act as network attached storage. ""Forgetting"" will be a thing of the past, as the processor will catalog the content of human memory by constant scanning and analysis of the material as it may appear in conscious and subconscious thought patterns, dreaming, etc. Merely ""trying"" to remember will fire the neural network which will synchronize with device storage to tell you why you DID just walk into the kitchen.The concept of ""cloud"" computing will be replaced with ""fog"" computing, as we all operate more within the cloud itself, which is established by the network of devices in proximity to one another and with access nodes which are everywhere. In remote or isolated situations, the system will operate only within itself, whilst it constantly searches for signals.Bulk data streams (the internet, for example) will be distributed by light from LEDs which will be common sources of illumination everywhere. These will ""blink"" at a visually imperceptible rate so as to communicate data in much the same way as fibre optic cables. Want an internet connection? Turn on a light. See a demonstration here:Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi InternetSocial implications will be especially notable, because users may establish beacons to communicate their social status. Thus, for example, strangers in search of romance (for even just a few hours) might set a ""beacon"" to broadcast their availability, personal data, desires and intent automatically. Those doing so are alerted whenever a ""match"" occurs. This is already anticipated by apps such as ""Tinder,"" but a beacon will work automatically.Anonymity and security are based on a combination of DNA, a ""Passthought,"" a physical gesture and spoken word or phrase.Other current developments will blossom under this new technology. Uber, for example, may be summoned by simply ""thinking"" for a ride. The nearest available ride will be directed to you.The system will also allow for the elimination of credit cards and similar transaction mediums. PayPal (or its descendants) will capitalize on this. To buy anything, anywhere, just ""think it."" The money is transferred in real time. But such decisions will be coupled with a deliberate act to verify, such as recitation of a string of characters out loud or whistling a measure of notes.  At a physical store, buyers simply walk out with their merchandise in hand. ""Clerks"" merely standby to answer door alarms when any item not thought-bought passes through a detector.Systems will also scan user's biological and mental functioning so as to recommend meal choices, produce an alert if blood chemistry detects a problem or some other indicator suggests an intervention is in order. In emergency medical situations, the system will do a data dump to first responders to suggest what immediate medical treatment is recommended.More and more vehicular transportation will be self-working.

This year is off to a good start too, with the company reporting better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2017 and raising expectations for its current quarter as well.$2.9 billion: estimated 2017 revenue13.Intel:-Intel is benefiting from a series of AI-centric investments and acquisitions it made to offset the decline of its main market, chips for personal computers. In the past year, it bought the deep-learning startup Nervana, the computer-vision chipmaker Movidius, and Mobileye, a supplier of assisted-driving systems. The Movidius purchase enabled Intel to sell chips to drone giant DJI, while the Mobileye acquisition brought it autonomous-driving partnerships with BMW and Delphi Automotive. In March, Intel launched an AI products group to further accelerate its AI efforts.46 percent: portion of revenues derived from areas beyond PC chips14.Quanergy Systems:-There are many startups trying to create compact, low-cost, high-quality lidar systems for autonomous vehicles, but Quanergy was the first to develop one using solid-state technology, which increases the reliability of the laser-scanning radar. The startup‚Äôs lidar is also relatively cheap to make because it uses some of the same materials and manufacturing processes as computer chips. The sensors, which are small enough to be embedded in car headlights, can be used in advanced driver-assistance systems and will be integrated into autonomous vehicles by 2021.$250: price of its S3 Lidar sensors for autonomous vehicles15.Apple:-Derided of late for a lack of innovative new products and tepid customer response to Apple Pay and the Apple Watch, Apple has launched a Siri-enabled speaker called HomePod to compete with Amazon‚Äôs Alexa-equipped Echo speaker. It‚Äôs also begun to tout its AI chops, including acknowledging its work on autonomous-driving systems. For some time Apple has been quietly hiring some impressive robotics and AI talent for its project, and its history of smart design and smooth integration of hardware and software may prove valuable assets.$257 billion: cash on its balance sheet, more than the entire market value of General Electric.Hope you enjoy.","5,315 followers",Valerio Cietto,999,2.4K,9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technologies-that-people-dont-know-about-yet,underground

However, recent technological developments show that we will be able to make predictions much more easily in the coming years. It is possible to say that these predictions will be true to a large extent.A group comprising of academicians and futurists in the U.K. have contemplated on what the world will be like 50 years later in 2069. This group prepared a report under the sponsorship of Samsung and shared its results. Here are 10 predictions for the future world:Underground roads:Underground skyscrapers:Self-cleaning houses:Space hotels:3D organs:Bug-burger takeaways:Flying buses or cabs:Body implants:4D air sports:Interactive virtual reality films:Adapting marketing strategies to artificial intelligence",6 followers,Michael Morse,9,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-worlds-technology-be-like-in-50-years,IoT

When I heard the doctor tell her ‚Äúsix months‚Äù, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away ‚Äî same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them ‚Äî we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do ‚Äî I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.‚ÄúOh my God Timmy, what's the catch?‚Äù‚ÄúThe price, Leon.‚ÄùWhen I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say ‚Äútwenty‚Äù, but I did it ‚Äî I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy ‚Äî especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights ‚Äî even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower ‚Äî so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love ‚Äî with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time ‚Äî I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶. Smile‚Ä¶‚ÄùJess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing ‚Äî I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, ‚ÄúWhere do I come from?‚Äù‚ÄúYou come from Heaven. You are my angel.‚ÄùThat answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, ‚ÄúIs it you, Jess?‚ÄùShe smiled and said, ‚ÄúIt is, silly ‚Äî now kiss me.‚ÄùHer head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back ‚Äî the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last ‚Äî she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron ‚Äî Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn ‚Äî My sister and friend.
