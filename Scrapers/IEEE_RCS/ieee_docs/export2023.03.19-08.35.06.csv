"Discussion: Relationships between Evolution of ERP Systems and IS Integration or Disintegration","T. Samara",NA,"ERP and Information Systems: Integration or Disintegration","","2015","","","81","89","This chapter discusses the meaning of the relationships between the research factors, evolution of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and information system (IS) integration or disintegration. The analysis, interpretation, deduction and results are based on the case studies and the literature review. The positive correlation between total dependency on the ERP vendor– (TDEV–) and economic crisis and competitiveness+ (ECCO+) could not help to implement a total integration of IS (TIIS). The explored negative correlation between TDEV– and interoperability of the ERP (INTE) could encourage a kind of disintegration and lead to a disintegrated information system (DIS), especially when the unreliability of the ERP system's interoperability is important. The positive correlation between project management ERP+ (PMER+) and evolution strategy of existing systems – or + (ESES– or +) and complexity of ERP+ (COER+) could improve integration.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075013.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Interoperability;Reliability;Project management;Correlation;Information systems;Complexity theory;Investment","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Literature Review: Factors Affecting the Relationships between the ERP System's Evolution and IS Integration or Disintegration","T. Samara",NA,"ERP and Information Systems: Integration or Disintegration","","2015","","","21","48","Given that an enterprise resource planning (ERP) is an indicator of information system (IS) integration, it is important to study some interaction factors between ERP systems and the IS. This chapter proposes economic crisis and competitiveness (ECCO), total dependency on the ERP vendor (TDEV), project management ERP (PMER), complexity of ERP (COER), and evolution strategy of ERP vendors (ESEV) as factors that could guide and impact the relationship between the ERP system's evolution and IS integration or disintegration. The interoperability of the ERP (INTE) system is its ability to interact with other subsystems (applications, legacy systems, ERP systems, etc.) within the whole of the IS. When the evolution strategy of existing systems (ESES) is based on ERP implementation, it aims to evaluate the fit of the ERP system in relation to the underlying business strategy.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075019.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Costs;Training;Complexity theory;Bibliographies;Scalability;Hardware;Companies","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"ERP: Contribution and Trends","T. Samara",NA,"ERP and Information Systems: Integration or Disintegration","","2015","","","9","14","This chapter illustrates the role and trends for enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation within the framework of the information systems (IS). For the purpose of the research, the selection of an ERP system and then the success or the failure of its implementation by a company can be used as an indicator to measure the integration rate for its IS. Bidan identified two categories of positioning for ERP systems within the framework of the IS: the partially standardized architecture and the mixed architecture. The chapter also shows the main trends related to the evolution of ERPs toward a new generation (2nd G). ERP is the information backbone of supply chain management. The emphasis on supply chain management and the advancement of information technology created a need for enterprise‐wide integration. Firms seek to use ERP systems to establish integration with other supply chain stakeholders.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075000.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Information systems;Software;Market research;Computer architecture;Aging;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Definition of Research Terms","T.

For the purpose of the research, the chapter distinguishes between two types of enterprise resource planning (ERP), namely ERP first or second generation. An information system (IS) could become a hybrid integration of IS (HIIS) when the architecture comprises many “Best of Breed (BoB)”︁ applications. Some organizations have developed their own customized suites of enterprise applications, an approach known as a BoB information technology (IT) strategy. Disintegrated information system (DIS) comprises disparate legacy systems including applications and ERP systems. For the purpose of the research, integration means a progression from DIS to HIIS or to total integration of information system (TIIS) and also from HIIS to TIIS.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075043.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Information systems;Software;Customer relationship management;Companies;Computer architecture;XML;Real-time systems","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Interests and Limitations of the Research","T. Samara",NA,"ERP and Information Systems: Integration or Disintegration","","2015","","","91","92","This chapter explains the strength and weakness of the research and covers the main result that might shape the relationships between the evolution of enterprise resource planning (ERP) packages and information systems (ISs). It finds that links between ERP systems and ISs are triggered by certain variables or factors: economic crisis and competitiveness, total dependency on the ERP vendors, project management, interoperability and complexity of the ERP systems, evolution strategies of existing systems and of ERP vendors. Although the ERP system's implementation is logically a factor aiming to improve the IS integration, the negative values of the research factors could prevent this integration. These negative values, that are related to the ERP system's evolution, could also cause a kind of IS regression from a state of integration toward one of disintegration. The chapter summarizes the interactions between the research factors, the evolution of ERP systems and IS integration or disintegration.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075010.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Information systems;Statistical analysis;Stakeholders;Research and development;Information technology;Enterprise resource planning;Distance measurement","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Case Studies","T.

It briefly describes the IS evolution for each firm with an analysis of the impact of the research factors on relationships between ERP systems and IS integration or disintegration. Before the successful updating in 2001, the integration problems between the three subsystems (SAP, Siebel and Manugistics) were related to the unreliability of the interoperability and to the ERP system's complexity. Oracle seeks to promote the interoperability of the final version, which contains an application integration architecture that includes middleware interoperability. This orchestration allows the linking of functions either from the existing software package or other solutions that may or may not be Oracle software.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075045.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Software;Information systems;Companies;Interoperability;Business;Training;System implementation","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Correlation Between Research Factors","T. Samara",NA,"ERP and Information Systems: Integration or Disintegration","","2015","","","49","69","Based on the literature review and a logical deduction, this chapter explores potential relationships between the research factors. It defines two principal types of correlations: positive correlation (PC) is a direct relationship where, as the amount of one variable (factor) increases, the amount of a second variable also increases; and negative correlation (NC) describes a relationship where, as the amount of one variable goes up, the amount of another variable goes down. The complexity of enterprise resource planning (ERP) (COER), high costs and implementation problems force numerous organizations to reconsider their new plans in relation to this enterprise system. The evolution strategy of ERP vendors (ESEV) should take into account the ERP system's customization process, which is often complex and costly. The evolution strategy of existing systems (ESES) information technology (IT) is impacted by the business strategy of the firms.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075008.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Correlation;Complexity theory;Costs;Standards organizations;Information systems;Companies;Maintenance engineering","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"The Research Question and Methodology","T. Samara",NA,"ERP and Information Systems: Integration or Disintegration","","2015","","","15","19","This chapter presents the research question and methodology. Researchers have often built their analyses on the fact that enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a package contributing to the information system (IS) integration. As an ERP is an indicator of IS integration, the selection of a suitable package and the success of its implementation could improve the integration of the existing system. The research methodology involves case studies that explore the relationships between the evolution of an ERP system and IS integration or disintegration. Case study research is suitable for descriptive and exploratory research. Three case studies have been conducted: the first two case studies analyze the IS of firms; while the third case study studies the strategy of an ERP vendor. The research methodology leads to the development of a typology by which one can establish some tendencies allowing researchers and practitioners to develop more knowledge in this field.","","9781119232728","10.1002/9781119232643.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075038.pdf&bkn=10074975&pdfType=chapter","","Stakeholders;Bibliographies;Interviews;Information systems;Project management;Interoperability;Economics","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Three types of latency are: latency linked to data, latency linked to analytical processes, and latency linked to decision‐making processes. Latency linked to data could be deemed ""technical"" as it is directly linked to the architecture and the urbanization of the information system. Latency linked to analytical processes consists of contextualizing the transaction data (from Big Data) using decision‐making data (to Smart Data). Latency linked to decision‐making processes relates to business; the determining factor is the capacity, and particularly the temporality, decision makers (or a delegated automated process) require to implement actions linked to their decision‐making.","","9781119119265","10.1002/9781119116189.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10067186.pdf&bkn=10066953&pdfType=chapter","","Organizations;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Information systems;Big Data;Decision making;Costs","","","","","","","","13 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Within the unstructured text we are often interested in systematic information—especially when we want to analyze the data using quantitative methods. The method usually proceeds in three steps. First it gathers the unstructured text, second determines the recurring patterns behind the information looking for, and third applies these patterns to the unstructured text to extract the information. This chapter focuses on the last two steps. It introduces powerful tool that helps retrieve data in such settings‐regular expressions. The chapter also introduces regular expressions as implemented in R. It provides an overview on how string manipulation can be used in practice.

Big Data (in its technical approach) is concerned with data processing; it is the ""data"" principally characterized by the four ""V""s. They are volume, variety, velocity and value. The technology that supports Big Data was launched by Google (in 2004) to process huge volumes of data (billions of queries are made online every day on search engines). The technology was inspired by massively parallel processing solutions (MapReduce) used for large scientific calculations. The principle was to parallelize data processing by distributing it over hundreds (and even thousands) of servers (Hadoop Distributed File System) organized into processing nodes. In MapReduce, results are consolidated to then feed the analytical follow‐up where this information is analyzed and consolidated to enrich decision‐making processes.","","9781119119265","10.1002/9781119116189.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10067136.pdf&bkn=10066953&pdfType=chapter","","Big Data;Data models;Internet;Business;Memory;Databases;Costs","","","","","","","","13 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The second step is the purchase action, again on an e‐commerce platform, that is subjected to price and offer availability constraints. The final step is the use of the service via the optimization of operational performance, which at each stage of the trip will have a direct impact on customer experience.

The chapter uses the word “rational,” to refer to decisions and behaviors that would be suggested by an SEU or game‐theoretic model of a particular situation. Prospect theory and behavioral decision theory have gone a long way toward identifying patterns in the way that the decisions deviate from those prescribed by rational theory.

The decision‐maker's choices act upon the world, causing changes in outcome probabilities. This chapter surveys some of the most useful methods for causal analysis, contrasts them with widely used but untrustworthy methods based on judgments about statistical associations, and develops their relations to Bayesian networks (BNs) and influence diagrams (IDs). Risk equations and causal models typically describe how changes in inputs to a system would change probabilities of outputs. This provides the essential scientific information needed to inform risk management decisions. IDs incorporate the flexible modeling capabilities of BNs for representing probabilistic causal mechanisms as conditional probability tables. ID risk and uncertainty analysis software clearly has great potential to facilitate probabilistic risk assessment. It can help to help visualize and communicate probable consequences of alternative choices.","","9781118938904","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932260.pdf&bkn=9932137&pdfType=chapter","","Risk management;Analytical models;Public healthcare;Mathematical models;Task analysis;Predictive models;Biological system modeling","","","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Traditional elicitation methods include the ratio method, the swing‐weight method, and the trade‐off and pricing‐out methods. This chapter focuses on an indirect elicitation process that converts (partial) rank orderings of the alternatives into point estimates or probability distributions for the various attribute weights. It discusses three mathematical methods that can be used to derive weight estimates in the additive multiattribute utility from rank orderings of alternatives: conjoint analysis in marketing, probabilistic inversion (PI) and Bayesian density estimation (BDE). Conjoint analysis is compelling because of its simplicity and computational ease, at least in its most widely used form of the Linear Programming Technique for Multidimensional Analysis of Preference (LINMAP). LINMAP also generates only point estimates for the attribute weights, while PI and BDE produce probability distributions.","","9781118938904","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932366.pdf&bkn=9932137&pdfType=chapter","","Stakeholders;Uncertainty;Probability distribution;Task analysis;Additives;Green products;Bibliographies","","","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This book talks about breakthroughs in decision and risk analysis‐new ideas, methods, and computational techniques that enable people and groups to choose more successfully when the consequences of different choices matter, yet are uncertain. It also discusses more recent developments‐including prospect theory and behavioral decision theory‐that seek to bridge the gap between the demanding requirements of subjective expected utility theory and the capabilities of real people to improve their decision‐making. These technical developments supported a firmly founded discipline of applied decision analysis, decision aids, and decision support consulting.

Rating‐based methods are easy to implement, are applicable to virtually any type of infrastructure system, and can provide useful insights to decision‐makers. Most commonly, risk‐based models compute risk as the product of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. The Transit Risk Assessment Module also uses event trees to assess vulnerability. Unlike risk‐based methods, game‐theoretic vulnerability‐assessment methods focus on the behavior of a strategic adversary. Interdiction models have been extensively applied to transportation, nuclear smuggling, border patrol, and so on.

This chapter focuses on a different point, namely, that the decisions also involve the additional dimension of “uncertainty about uncertainty,” or environmental uncertainty. The field of optimal learning explores how to move from experience‐based decisions, which reflect the sum total of our current knowledge about a problem, to anticipatory decisions that consider the potential for error or change in that knowledge. Anticipatory decisions are entering current business practice. The chapter explores two examples where anticipatory decisions offer significant improvements over experience‐based decisions. Optimal learning methods work best when the information budget is very limited. As is frequent in operations research, optimal learning is most effective when used in tandem with other methodologies such as data analytics to build a body of prior information and conduct a prescreening of obviously unpromising choices.","","9781118938904","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932288.pdf&bkn=9932137&pdfType=chapter","","Uncertainty;Business;Costs;Predictive models;Decision making;Data models;Contracts","","","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The requirements of CFD vary for each type of space, especially if the focus is human comfort rather than equipment operating conditions. This chapter focuses primarily on the data hall but also addresses some of the other issues that may occasionally be addressed for a data hall or arise in other data center applications. CFD has been used to model many corporate data centers.

There are several regression performance measures calculated by comparing the model's predictions and true target function values on a particular dataset. Regression model performance measures, however, have to take into account the specificity of numeric predictions and are presented more extensively. The most common regression performance measures are based on the differences between true and predicted function values. Such differences are called model residuals. Of several types of residual‐based performance measures, the mean absolute error (MAE) is the most straightforward. This chapter reviews the evaluation procedures, with examples of their application to regression models. These procedures can all be used to generate vectors of predicted and true target function values, making it possible to calculate arbitrary performance measures based on these vectors.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821190.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Mean square error methods;Training;Regression tree analysis;Predictive models;Measurement uncertainty;Root mean square;Particle measurements","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Threat modeling divides a threat into multiple attacks, making it easier to see how each attack scenario unfolds. For each scenario, impact of any adverse aftermath can be ascertained with greater accuracy, thereby re‐establishing the credibility of the security analysis. The ability to understand impact is central to reporting a threat. Devoid of this capability, identifying and communicating threats merely becomes an exercise built around hype and fear factor. This chapter provides a comparative look as to how threat modeling, in its original form, has been applied in hostile environments that encompass both physical and logical attacks, most notably in tactical military operations.","","9781118988367","10.1002/9781118988374.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821458.pdf&bkn=9820792&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Missiles;Software;Application security;Data models;Biological system modeling;US Department of Defense","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Morana",NA; NA,"Risk Centric Threat Modeling: Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis","","2015","","","63","136","This chapter covers a preliminary risk analysis of an application using threat modeling techniques. This type of technical risk analysis needs to consider other factors besides likelihood and impact, such as the exposure to potential threat agents and attack vectors to these assets. It is therefore critical to consider different threat scenarios and determine the different types of attack vectors that threat agents can use against the assets and components of the application architecture and determine the impact when the application vulnerabilities are exploited. One of the risk management benefits of application threat modeling is helping information security professionals to manage vulnerability risks by prioritizing the remediation of these vulnerabilities according to their severity. To conduct the threat analysis in an objective manner, it is important to analyze the threat likelihood as well as the potential impact using a threat library.","","9781118988367","10.1002/9781118988374.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821131.pdf&bkn=9820792&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Risk management;Online banking;Malware;Standards organizations;Sensitivity;Data breach","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter aims to acquaint a mechanical designer with data center design and give them the technical grounding required to move beyond replication of proven, yet often obsolete, designs and into creating optimized solutions that meet the unique requirements of their clients. A careful investigation of the design criteria and consideration of their impact on the design help to best serve the actual needs of the client. The chapter discusses the most common system approaches to four key areas of data center design: the cooling medium, heat rejection method, air delivery path, and air management.

There are number of quality measures designed to describe the level of a particular cluster's cohesion and/or its separation from other clusters. Some of these per‐cluster measures can be appropriately aggregated into overall clustering quality measures, though. The diameter of a cluster is the maximum dissimilarity between its members. Although per‐cluster quality measures provide useful insights into the quality of the evaluated clustering model, what is usually desired is a single quality indicator, that can be used to directly compare a number of alternative models. This is the purpose of overall quality measures that take into account all clusters, and combine some indicators of their cohesion and separation in a meaningful way. The primary application of external quality measures is for clustering algorithm benchmarking, which is a common research task.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821034.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Training;Predictive models;Data models;Clustering algorithms;Particle measurements;IEEE Sections;Codes","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This is essentially based on using a composite model representation function, consisting of a real‐valued inner representation function and a discrete outer representation function that assigns class labels based on the former. In principle, parametric model representation is applicable to both classification and regression models, since the employed representation function can be real valued or discrete valued. Parameter estimation can be viewed as an optimization process in which the space of possible parameter vectors is searched for the one that optimizes an adopted performance measure. It is common for classification tasks to involve discrete attributes, either alone or along with continuous attributes. For parametric classification to be applicable to such tasks the inner representation function and its gradient must be capable of handling discrete attributes.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821287.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Task analysis;Parameter estimation;Codes;Parametric statistics;Linear regression;Classification algorithms;Predictive models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

As a result, many providers have developed what they refer to as “modular” data centers. At the present time, there are five categories of data centers that are generally considered to be “modular” within the marketplace: traditional modular data centers; monolithic modular data centers; containerized data halls; prefabricated data hall; and stand‐alone data centers. Scaling, or adding new data centers, is possible using either a hosting or wholesale approach. Build versus buy is an age‐old business question.

The discussion of model representation and creation techniques maintains a higher level of generality whenever possible, presenting the particular linear representation as an instantiation of the more general parametric regression approach. The essential feature of parametric representation is using a predetermined representation function, which reduces model creation to estimating model parameters from data. The gradient descent algorithm can be directly used with discrete attributes as long as this binary encoding is applied when calculating the representation function and its gradient.

This chapter presents the description and examples illustrating the most commonly used attribute transformations. Attribute transformation is often viewed as a simple operation that, once applied to the available dataset, can be completely ignored thereafter, with all subsequent analytical processing performed on the transformed data. The most commonly used modeling and nonmodeling attribute transformations perform simple arithmetic or logical operations, needed to adjust the data to the requirements or capabilities of some classification, regression, or clustering algorithms. Multiclass encoding is based on the decomposition of the original classification task with a multiclass target concept into a number of tasks with two‐class target concepts.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821418.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Task analysis;Data models;Training;Predictive models;Codes;Classification algorithms;Analytical models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

There is a great deal of interest shown by most major corporations in reducing the impact of IT on the environment. Many organizations use three key metrics proposed by The Green Grid: Power Utilization Effectiveness (PUE) relating to overall efficiency in the data center, Carbon utilization Effectiveness (CUE), which refers to the Carbon footprint associated with energy consumption, and most recently, a metric associated with water, Water Utilization Effectiveness (WUE), which represents the amount of water consumed in the production of data. One of the important features when implementing any DCIM solution is the ability to gather and normalize existing sources of asset and connectivity data. The DCIM marketplace is rapidly progressing as a management category. DCIM has been an emerging technology of increasingly high interest since the mid‐2000s.","","9781118937587","10.1002/9781118937563.ch33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821293.pdf&bkn=9820789&pdfType=chapter","","Data centers;Business;Costs;Capacity planning;Asset management;Technological innovation;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Hierarchical clustering","P. Cichosz",NA,"Data Mining Algorithms: Explained Using R","","2015","","","349","372","This chapter reviews two approaches to creating hierarchical clustering models, both of which have very simple formulations: agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering. A hierarchical clustering model is a multilevel hierarchy of clusters. Each internal node of the hierarchy represents a cluster that is partitioned into subclusters represented by its descendants. The family of agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) algorithms adopts the most natural and direct method of discovering multilevel instance similarity patterns. Divisive hierarchical clustering can therefore be considered a wrapper approach to creating cluster hierarchies which turns a flat clustering algorithm into a hierarchical clustering algorithm by its repeated application. The most ultimate stop criterion for divisive clustering could be reaching singleton bottom‐level clusters, such as those that agglomerative clustering starts from. Hierarchical clustering is most commonly presented as serving the purpose of discovering and presenting the similarity structure of the training set and the domain from which it comes.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821251.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Vegetation;Merging;Predictive models;Training;Reliability","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The most popular general purpose dissimilarity and similarity measures presented in the chapter fall into two categories: difference based and correlation based. Difference‐based dissimilarity measures are particularly common and often adopted as default for dissimilarity‐based clustering algorithms unless existing domain knowledge suggests that they may be inappropriate. Measuring instance similarity based on attribute value differences appears perfectly reasonable and is indeed the right way to follow in most situations, but for some domains it may yield misleading results. Missing attribute values, a common problem for real‐world datasets, have an obvious impact on instance similarity assessment.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821327.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Euclidean distance;Codes;Clustering algorithms;Wrapping;Transforms;Time measurement;IEEE Sections","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Decision tree pruning is an insurance policy against overfitting motivated by Ockham's razor. To fully describe a pruning algorithm, one needs to specify the following major components thereof: pruning operators; pruning criterion; and pruning control strategy. The most important benefit resulting from the capability of using weighted instances is the possibility of easily incorporating nonuniform misclassification costs.

Spears",NA; NA,"Data Center Handbook","","2015","","","495","521","Businesses today invest large sums of money in their IT infrastructure, as well as the power required to keep it functioning. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) are an extremely important part of the electrical infrastructure where high levels of power quality and reliability are required. This chapter discusses basics of UPS designs, typical applications where UPS are most commonly used, considerations for UPS selection, and other components or options that are an important part of purchasing and deploying a UPS system. With proper servicing and a stable environment, a well‐made UPS can operate safely and reliably for as long as 20 years. Communication software can not only provide real‐time notification of UPS status but also let one assign automatic actions to perform in case of a power event. This is extremely useful if one's system operates continuously without users being present to manually shut down affected equipment.","","9781118937587","10.1002/9781118937563.ch27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821292.pdf&bkn=9820789&pdfType=chapter","","Uninterruptible power systems;Switches;Inverters;Batteries;Voltage;Maintenance engineering;Companies","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It reviews several general techniques that can be used to make classification algorithms cost‐sensitive. One approach to incorporating misclassification costs that is not algorithm specific, but applicable to a wider class of classification algorithms, is based on instance weighting. Instance weighting or instance resampling can deal with simplified cost matrices only. The instance relabeling technique turns out to work better than the minimum‐cost rule for decision trees on the original four‐class dataset only if class probabilities are estimated with bagging. The experimental procedure for drawing reliable conclusions about the capabilities of the techniques of misclassification cost incorporation should include multiple algorithms, multiple datasets, random costs, and reliable evaluation.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821148.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Costs;Automobiles;Task analysis;Codes;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Weight measurement","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Intrusion detection may be carried out at the network level, or at the host level, or both. The first type of intrusion detection is referred to as network‐based detection (NBD), the second type as host‐based detection, and the third type as hybrid detection (HBD). An NBD is responsible for checking packets in the network, identifying which packets are yellow‐light behaviors and which are red‐light behaviors, and sending warning messages to the alarm manager in the command console. Signature detections and statistical analysis are major intrusion detection techniques used in both NBDs and HBDs. Typical intrusion detection systems (IDS) use one of the following three methods for modeling signatures: built‐in system, programming system, and expert system. The chapter also discusses behavioral data forensics, which studies how to use data mining techniques to analyze event logs and search for useful information.","","9781118939499","10.1002/9781119113102.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821456.pdf&bkn=9820798&pdfType=chapter","","Intrusion detection;Security;Computers;Behavioral sciences;Passwords;IP networks;Firewalls (computing)","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

While ISO 14644‐1 addresses particulate contaminants, ANSI/ISA‐71.04 addresses gaseous composition environmental limits in 1985. Gas‐phase filtration systems are recommended by ASHRAE for data centers with higher gaseous contamination levels.

This chapter outlines the motivation behind discretization and discusses the definition of the task in more detail. The ultimate verification of the effects of discretization is always provided by the evaluation of models obtained when performing the target task using discretized data. Unsupervised discretization algorithms, which do not take any target attribute into account, are based entirely on the observed distribution of the continuous attribute to be discretized in the training set. Supervised discretization requires considerably more effort than the simple unsupervised algorithms. Since discretization is a part of the modeling process, its effects have to be therefore evaluated using an independent data subset. This can be accomplished by employing a selected evaluation procedure.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821245.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Task analysis;Training;Classification algorithms;Data models;Prediction algorithms;Computational modeling;Codes","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

For any performance measure, it is important to distinguish between its value for a particular dataset (dataset performance), especially the training set (training performance), and its expected performance on the whole domain (true performance). One convenient tool that facilitates classifier performance evaluation in multiple operating points, operating point comparison, and operating point selection, is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

HA is proactively designing systems to mitigate a system failure, to minimize downtime to a negligible amount, and to ensure and assume no data loss. The investment in any DR and HA strategy will be primarily driven by business and not technology imperatives.

The expectation of model ensembles to improve over individual models is sometimes explained by the common‐sense idea of a committee consisting of multiple “experts,” making better decisions collectively than individually. The main challenge for successful ensemble modeling is creating sufficiently many sufficiently diverse and sufficiently good base models. Various combinations of all the possible approaches to base model creation and aggregation may be used, yielding a variety of ensemble modeling techniques. Model ensembles may be often expected to outperform single models, even created using refined and carefully tuned algorithms. Sometimes, particularly for boosting and random forests, the improvement may be quite substantial. It is, however the combination of data, base model creation algorithms, and ensemble modeling techniques that is ultimately responsible for the final prediction quality.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821393.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Predictive models;Training;Computational modeling;Regression tree analysis;Task analysis;Load modeling;Linear regression","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Of all algorithms using explicit similarity or dissimilarity measures, k‐centers algorithms employ these measures in the most direct and straightforward way to determine cluster membership. The algorithm scheme contains the following major operations: initialization, instance assignment, center adjustment, and stop criteria. The k‐centers algorithm instantiated to use attribute value median vectors as cluster centers yields the k‐medians algorithm. Assuming a fixed predetermined number of clusters helps the k‐centers algorithm to maintain its simplicity and efficiency, but can also be considered a substantial deficiency. The main motivation for creating an explicit cluster model is the incomprehensibility of k‐centers implicit cluster membership prediction. An explicit cluster membership model can be created as a classification model, by applying a classification algorithm with cluster membership assignment used as the target concept.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821507.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Clustering algorithms;Training;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Partitioning algorithms;Load modeling;Generators","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The chapter also introduces a dual signature scheme for electronic transactions and a blind signature scheme for producing electronic cash. A digital blind signature can be achieved using the RSA cryptosystem and a blind factor as follows, where a blind factor is used to make a message unintelligible.","","9781118939499","10.1002/9781119113102.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821260.pdf&bkn=9820798&pdfType=chapter","","Fingerprint recognition;Authentication;Resistance;Cryptographic hash function;Standards;Public key cryptography;Time complexity","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Green Microprocessor and Server Design","G. AlLee",NA,"Data Center Handbook","","2015","","","401","418","A green data center is all about getting the most compute productivity out of the least energy. Key to that is selecting an appropriate microprocessor and server with which to populate that data center. This chapter concerns itself with microprocessor and server design: not so much on how to plan, design, and create them, but on how to judge and select among them as ingredients. Thus, it first describes some guiding principles to aid your selection process. The chapter then discusses the microprocessor and server system, as well as considerations with respect to storage, software, and racks. There are many levels of software and they can have an impact on the energy use of a data center. There are four levels of software that exist on a server platform: Firmware (FW), Operating System (OS), Middleware and Application Software.","","9781118937587","10.1002/9781118937563.ch21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821462.pdf&bkn=9820789&pdfType=chapter","","Microprocessors;Servers;Productivity;Data centers;Voltage;Clocks;Instruction sets","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Network Security Overview","J. Wang; Z. A. Kissel",NA; NA,"Introduction to Network Security: Theory and Practice","","2015","","","1","44","Network security needs to guard networked computer systems and protect electronic data that is either stored in networked computers or transmitted in the networks. To achieve the goal of network security, one must first understand the attackers, what could become their targets, and how these targets might be attacked. The tasks of network security are to provide confidentiality, integrity, nonrepudiation, and availability of useful data that are transmitted in public networks or stored in networked computers. Building a deep layered defense system is the best possible defense tactic in network security. Within this type of defense system, multiple layers of defense mechanisms are used to resist possible attacks. Attackers are often characterized as black‐hat hackers, script kiddies, cyber spies, employees, and cyber terrorists. The basic security model consists of four components, namely cryptosystems, firewalls, anti‐malicious‐software (AMS software), and intrusion detection systems (IDS system).","","9781118939499","10.1002/9781119113102.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821196.pdf&bkn=9820798&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Passwords;Encryption;Network security;Computer security;IP networks;Software","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Kissel",NA; NA,"Introduction to Network Security: Theory and Practice","","2015","","","93","128","This chapter first introduces the basic concepts of public‐key cryptography (PKC). It then describes several concrete public‐key cryptosystems, including Diffie‐Hellman key exchange, Elgamal public‐key cryptosystem, RSA public‐key cryptosystem, and elliptic‐curve PKC. These methods use several results in number theory. The chapter also discusses several common attacks on RSA that take advantage of inappropriately selected parameters. This will serve as a guideline for choosing correct RSA parameters. The security of elliptic‐curve cryptography (ECC) rests on the difficulty of solving the elliptic‐curve logarithm problem, which has not been studied as intensively as the discrete logarithm problem. However, the requirements of ECC parameters are not as rigid as those of RSA. Finally, the chapter discusses how to transmit secret keys using PKC without sharing prior secrets and how to manage keys. To use PKC to encrypt or authenticate data, one must first obtain the receivers' public keys.","","9781118939499","10.1002/9781119113102.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821230.pdf&bkn=9820798&pdfType=chapter","","Encryption;Elliptic curve cryptography;Regulation;Network security;Authentication;Arithmetic;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Attribute selection","P. Cichosz",NA,"Data Mining Algorithms: Explained Using R","","2015","","","558","601","The attribute selection task essentially consists in selecting a subset of originally available attributes to be subsequently used for model creation. This chapter outlines the motivation behind attribute selection and discusses the definition of the task in more detail. General‐purpose attribute selection algorithms can be applied to select attributes for arbitrary target algorithms, and – sometimes – also for different target tasks. A search strategy is needed for any attribute selection technique that is based on evaluating attribute subsets rather than single attributes. This includes primarily attribute selection wrappers, but also some of attribute selection filters. Two major flavors of filtering attribute selection algorithms can be distinguished depending on whether they evaluate individual attributes or candidate attribute subsets. Attribute selection has to be always considered as a part of the modeling process in a broader sense. Its effects have to be therefore evaluated using an independent data subset.","","9781118950845","10.1002/9781118950951.ch19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821244.pdf&bkn=9820790&pdfType=chapter","","Task analysis;Search problems;Training;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Partitioning algorithms;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Conclusion","B. Levite; A. Rakow",NA; NA,"Energy Resilient Buildings & Communities: A Practical Guide","","2015","","","197","200","This book is written as a practical guide to those interested in the pursuit of energy resilience at a local scale. Energy resilience is defined as the relative ability of an institution to carry out its mission during a shock to the energy system and approach the concept on the level of a single site occupied by a single community or institution. Examples are drawn from four key community types: military bases, healthcare campuses, educational campuses, and municipal governments. The book then describes a framework for developing an energy resilience plan that applies to each. While the focus is clearly on the United States, understanding the energy resilience threat and conducting long-range energy resilience planning will benefit communities all over the globe. Divided into three main parts, Part One describes the specific energy security threats that are facing local institutions and communities and how an energy shock can affect the mission at each of the four community types and the advantages that each will enjoy in their pursuit of energy resilience. Part Two provides concrete guidance for pursuing energy resilience at a particular institution and allows managers to assess where their institution lies on the energy resilience spectrum and plot a course toward where they would like to be. Part Three describes the three main areas of energy resilience performance: energy efficiency, on-site generation, and emergency planning. Case studies are also provided.","","9788770223232","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9558011.pdf&bkn=9557892&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","4 Oct 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Energy resilience is defined as the relative ability of an institution to carry out its mission during a shock to the energy system and approach the concept on the level of a single site occupied by a single community or institution. Examples are drawn from four key community types: military bases, healthcare campuses, educational campuses, and municipal governments. The book then describes a framework for developing an energy resilience plan that applies to each. While the focus is clearly on the United States, understanding the energy resilience threat and conducting long-range energy resilience planning will benefit communities all over the globe. Divided into three main parts, Part One describes the specific energy security threats that are facing local institutions and communities and how an energy shock can affect the mission at each of the four community types and the advantages that each will enjoy in their pursuit of energy resilience. Part Two provides concrete guidance for pursuing energy resilience at a particular institution and allows managers to assess where their institution lies on the energy resilience spectrum and plot a course toward where they would like to be. Part Three describes the three main areas of energy resilience performance: energy efficiency, on-site generation, and emergency planning.

Energy resilience is defined as the relative ability of an institution to carry out its mission during a shock to the energy system and approach the concept on the level of a single site occupied by a single community or institution. Examples are drawn from four key community types: military bases, healthcare campuses, educational campuses, and municipal governments. The book then describes a framework for developing an energy resilience plan that applies to each. While the focus is clearly on the United States, understanding the energy resilience threat and conducting long-range energy resilience planning will benefit communities all over the globe. Divided into three main parts, Part One describes the specific energy security threats that are facing local institutions and communities and how an energy shock can affect the mission at each of the four community types and the advantages that each will enjoy in their pursuit of energy resilience. Part Two provides concrete guidance for pursuing energy resilience at a particular institution and allows managers to assess where their institution lies on the energy resilience spectrum and plot a course toward where they would like to be. Part Three describes the three main areas of energy resilience performance: energy efficiency, on-site generation, and emergency planning. Case studies are also provided.","","9788770223232","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9557918.pdf&bkn=9557892&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","4 Oct 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Rakow",NA; NA,"Energy Resilient Buildings & Communities: A Practical Guide","","2015","","","27","50","This book is written as a practical guide to those interested in the pursuit of energy resilience at a local scale. Energy resilience is defined as the relative ability of an institution to carry out its mission during a shock to the energy system and approach the concept on the level of a single site occupied by a single community or institution. Examples are drawn from four key community types: military bases, healthcare campuses, educational campuses, and municipal governments. The book then describes a framework for developing an energy resilience plan that applies to each. While the focus is clearly on the United States, understanding the energy resilience threat and conducting long-range energy resilience planning will benefit communities all over the globe. Divided into three main parts, Part One describes the specific energy security threats that are facing local institutions and communities and how an energy shock can affect the mission at each of the four community types and the advantages that each will enjoy in their pursuit of energy resilience. Part Two provides concrete guidance for pursuing energy resilience at a particular institution and allows managers to assess where their institution lies on the energy resilience spectrum and plot a course toward where they would like to be. Part Three describes the three main areas of energy resilience performance: energy efficiency, on-site generation, and emergency planning.

This book describes the elements needed in planning and implementing a “Smart Grid” by outlining how the electricity delivery system can be modernized so it monitors, protects, and automatically optimizes the operation of its interconnected elements—from the central and distributed generator through the high-voltage network and distribution system, to energy storage installations and to end-use consumers and their thermostats, electric vehicles, appliances, and other household devices. This comprehensive guide highlights emerging concepts of cyber and physical security, resiliency, and the newest architecture—“The Integrated Grid.” You’ll gain an understanding of how a two-way flow of electricity and information can be used to create an automated, widely distributed energy delivery network.","","9788770223270","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9558059.pdf&bkn=9557891&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","4 Oct 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Index","B. Levite; A. Rakow",NA; NA,"Energy Resilient Buildings & Communities: A Practical Guide","","2015","","","213","214","This book is written as a practical guide to those interested in the pursuit of energy resilience at a local scale. Energy resilience is defined as the relative ability of an institution to carry out its mission during a shock to the energy system and approach the concept on the level of a single site occupied by a single community or institution. Examples are drawn from four key community types: military bases, healthcare campuses, educational campuses, and municipal governments. The book then describes a framework for developing an energy resilience plan that applies to each. While the focus is clearly on the United States, understanding the energy resilience threat and conducting long-range energy resilience planning will benefit communities all over the globe. Divided into three main parts, Part One describes the specific energy security threats that are facing local institutions and communities and how an energy shock can affect the mission at each of the four community types and the advantages that each will enjoy in their pursuit of energy resilience. Part Two provides concrete guidance for pursuing energy resilience at a particular institution and allows managers to assess where their institution lies on the energy resilience spectrum and plot a course toward where they would like to be. Part Three describes the three main areas of energy resilience performance: energy efficiency, on-site generation, and emergency planning. Case studies are also provided.","","9788770223232","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9558056.pdf&bkn=9557892&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","4 Oct 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

On one hand, this process is considered the most energy-consuming stage in MDF manufacturing which affecting the final price of the product, in addition, the loss of the energy represents50-60% of the total energy. On the other hand, the product quality is depending on how the drying performance is going on i.e. the investigation of the produced MDF properties is directly related to how the desired moisture content is obtained. The authors propose drying process improvement through the control side of view by optimizing the amount of energy that is required for drying the wet resinated fibers before pressing it into aboard during the pressing stage. Consequently, achieving a simulation model for the drying process is the target in this study. The obtained model has been verified using the experimental data from, Nag-Hamady Fiberboard Company, Qena, Egypt. Using the proposed mathematical models, the estimated values of the mixing chamber outlet air temperature, and wet fiber temperature at the inlet of the drying process were satisfactory comparing with the experimental results, where the model of the processed fiber temperature at the outlet of the drying process has to be modified.","","978-1-5090-0217-7","10.1109/ICCTA37466.2015.9513444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513444","Medium density fiberboard;Drying process;Flash dryer;Mathematical modeling","Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Process control;Pressing;Companies;Production;Optical fiber theory","drying;moisture;resins;wood products","drying process;processed fiber temperature;MDF bagasse fiber;Medium Density Fiberboard production;energy-consuming stage;MDF manufacturing;total energy;product quality;drying performance;produced MDF properties;process improvement;pressing stage;simulation model","","","","17","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to adapt to the increasing demand for high-precision motion, nonlinear friction forces and angular transmission error, which deteriorate the control performance of the positioning mechanism, should be compensated. In this study, a Modified Model Predictive Control (MMPC), methodology has been proposed to improve positioning precision of a harmonic drive mechanism, i.e. transient characteristics, based on forcing the manipulated output to track a predesigned reference trajectory. The MMPC has been designed in order that, the effect of system disturbances could be reduced. Numerical simulations have been provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The performance characteristics of the proposed scheme has been compared to those obtained using the standard Model Predictive Control (MPC) and conventional controllers.

After that an initial kernel estimation at different angles is performed using the initial latent image that was produced using sparse representation. Each estimated kernel is transformed to radon transform and the set of projections at different angles are stored. An inverse radon transform is applied to make a final kernel estimation. Finally, the Wiener deconvolution is performed to estimate the final latent sharp image. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

In the presented work, we are interested to an algorithm, namely Sparse Subspace clustering (SSC). This algorithm has showed encouraging results to cluster high dimensional data. In spite, the meaningful drawback of SSC is its computational complexity due to the solving of the sparse optimization problem. In this study, we propose a new method which can deal with large scale issues.

The later kinds of behaviors can be modeled using hybrid automata. However, the formal model of hybrid automata does not allow to reason about knowledge of agents. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to present a novel model that allows us to represent the continuous dynamics behavior of agents on one hand, and to reason about knowledge of agents on the other hand. To achieve this goal, the paper introduces epistemic hybrid automata that extend hybrid automata with epistemic logic.

ROEF is a search engine where a user can register his personal information and areas of interest, and link his social networking profiles to his ROEF profile. After registration, every time the user searches for any query, the results returned are filtered and ranked by cross-referencing the search query with the user's ROEF profile information. These results are returned as semantic search documents, which can then be processed and displayed in both user-friendly GUI and machine-friendly XML formats respectively, thus providing a unique and personalized searching experience for the end-user, and simple service-based integration with other applications. The product of this paper is a fully functioning proof-of-concept that is limited by the lack of a complete semantic knowledge base, and future enhancements include more advanced query optimization, performance enhancements, and developing semantic web crawlers and scutters which will maintain and expand the semantic knowledge base.","","978-1-5090-0217-7","10.1109/ICCTA37466.2015.9513436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513436","Web3.0;Semantic web;Personalized web;Semantic search","Semantic Web;Semantic search;Social networking (online);Query processing;Knowledge based systems;XML;Search engines","graphical user interfaces;information retrieval;Internet;query processing;search engines;semantic Web;social networking (online);XML","smart search engine;3rd generation world wide Web;personalized sematic web semantic search engine ROEF;Register Once Enjoy Forever;current search engines;smart Web3;personalized Web3;personal information;social networking profiles;search query;ROEF profile information;semantic search documents;user-friendly GUI;unique searching experience;personalized searching experience;end-user;complete semantic knowledge base;semantic web crawlers;scutters","","","","12","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several techniques have developed in order to avoid such danger loss of life and property. In this paper, we have proposed an approach using GPS and RF module for detecting and avoiding train collisions. The GPS module identifies the location, speed, and direction of the trains with highest accuracy. This information transfers to the train microcontroller in the same vicinity via RF module. The availability of the information allows the train microcontroller type PIC16F877 to take accurate decision as for train location. This system warns the driver both visually and by giving an alert sound, to allow avoiding the collision between trains when they are separated by one kilo. We used a vibration sensor for sensing the train on the track.

If the mechanisms purpose is to perform several tasks and it contains closed kinematical loops then the tasks are usually different motion modes of the mechanism connected by singularities in c-space. This means that in order to switch the mechanism from one task to an other the mechanism needs to go through a singularity in c-space. Now there are different kinds of singularities and our main purpose here is introduce concepts and tools which allows to investigate and design the properties of these singularities.

Today, network security is the most important concern for any computer network administrator. Traditional networks had several security problems, some of them no longer exist with the advent of SDN and others still do exist. ARP spoofing or ARP cache-poisoning attack is mainly seen in LAN networks, which has no efficient solution to mitigate in traditional networks but SDN provides a unique way to solve this problem without any changes in the network. ARP spoofing is exploited in different forms, mainly request and reply based attacks. In this paper, a solution is proposed to mitigate both of these types of ARP attacks in Software defined networks. The proposed solution extends the SDN controller to include an ARP module, which detects and stops the attack, and avoids overloading or Denial of Service on the controller. The solution is fast, reliable and tested for different attack scenarios. Openflow is used for the communication between the controller and switches, emulated by Mininet.","","978-1-5090-0217-7","10.1109/ICCTA37466.2015.9513433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513433","Software-Defined Networking;ARP;ARP spoofing mitigation;Security.","Technological innovation;Protocols;Computer network reliability;Reliability theory;Control systems;Software reliability;Security","computer network management;computer network security;IP networks;local area networks;protocols;software defined networking","Software-Defined Networks;network programmability;network management;network security;computer network administrator;ARP cache-poisoning attack;LAN networks;reply based attacks;SDN controller;ARP module;Openflow;Mininet","","9","","24","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this regard, first order discrete-time transfer function (TF) of Bitumen system with samples time delays more than unity is utilized to formulate the novel NMSS-PI/PID form. The approach then develops state variable feedback (SVF) control law for PI/PID implementation on Bitumen system, sited at INSUMAT Company. The work also introduces proportionalintegral-plus (PIP) control as a well-established model-based, full state feedback control, when applied to the same Bitumen system, as benchmark. For consistent comparison, NMSS-PIP form is formulated using the same TF, then optimizing the PIP gains via LQ cost function. Here, the Bitumen temperature should not exceed ± 5% of the specified temperature (90 oC-180 oC) in order to achieve an accepted properties for the produced material. Moreover, overshoot behaviour is not allowed in order to avoid self-ignition for the vapor inside the Bitumen tank. Simulation results verify the applicability of the new discrete PID approach. Also both discrete PID and PIP control show satisfactory steady state response with good control action, with little significant improvement of PIP over new approach of discrete PID control. The paper shows successful implementation `onsite' for the two controllers, for which all the control design criteria are met.","","978-1-5090-0217-7","10.1109/ICCTA37466.2015.9513435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513435","discrete PID control;proportional-integral-plus (PIP) control;non-minimal state space (NMSS);Bitumen tank","State feedback;Asphalt;Temperature;Delay effects;Simulation;Transfer functions;Aerospace electronics","control system synthesis;delays;discrete time systems;feedback;linear quadratic control;PI control;state feedback;state-space methods;three-term control;transfer functions","Bitumen system;state feedback control;NMSS-PIP form;LQ;Bitumen temperature;Bitumen tank;discrete PID approach;satisfactory steady state response;good control action;discrete PID control;control design criteria;new tuning approach;nonminimal state space formulation;optimal tuning approach;Linear Quadratic cost function;nonminimal state space form;order discrete-time transfer function;samples time delays;state variable feedback control law","","1","","31","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Looking beyond the conventional answers—for the sake of truth, beauty, and practical applications—this book offers an eclectic panorama of the lives and values and hopes and fears of mathematicians in the twenty-first century, assembling material from a startlingly diverse assortment of scholarly, journalistic, and pop culture sources.Drawing on his personal experiences and obsessions as well as the thoughts and opinions of mathematicians from Archimedes and Omar Khayyám to such contemporary giants as Alexander Grothendieck and Robert Langlands, Michael Harris reveals the charisma and romance of mathematics as well as its darker side. In this portrait of mathematics as a community united around a set of common intellectual, ethical, and existential challenges, he touches on a wide variety of questions, such as: Are mathematicians to blame for the 2008 financial crisis? How can we talk about the ideas we were born too soon to understand? And how should you react if you are asked to explain number theory at a dinner party?Disarmingly candid, relentlessly intelligent, and richly entertaining, Mathematics without Apologies takes readers on an unapologetic guided tour of the mathematical life, from the philosophy and sociology of mathematics to its reflections in film and popular music, with detours through the mathematical and mystical traditions of Russia, India, medieval Islam, the Bronx, and beyond.","","9781400885527","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452654.pdf&bkn=9452653&pdfType=book","mathematicians;Archimedes;Omar Khayyám;Alexander Grothendieck;Robert Langlands;mathematics;Herbert Mehrtens;charisma;number theory;dinner party;Birch–Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture;professional autonomy;finance mathematics;morality;mathematical finance;mathematical modeling;reality;mathematical equations;Thomas Pynchon;Against the Day;mind–body problem;Edward Frenkel;Rites of Love and Math;films;transcendental numbers;Joseph Liouville;mathematical concepts;mathematical problems;tricks;tricksters;congruences;cohomology;unramified coverings;Drinfel'd upper half-spaces;excellence;G.

The stewards of Earth, these organisms transformed the chemistry of our planet to make it habitable for plants, animals, and us. Life's Engines takes readers deep into the microscopic world to explore how these marvelous creatures made life on Earth possible—and how human life today would cease to exist without them.Paul Falkowski looks ""under the hood"" of microbes to find the engines of life, the actual working parts that do the biochemical heavy lifting for every living organism on Earth. With insight and humor, he explains how these miniature engines are built—and how they have been appropriated by and assembled like Lego sets within every creature that walks, swims, or flies. Falkowski shows how evolution works to maintain this core machinery of life, and how we and other animals are veritable conglomerations of microbes.A vibrantly entertaining book about the microbes that support our very existence, Life's Engines will inspire wonder about these elegantly complex nanomachines that have driven life since its origin.

It derives the best possible functional images for small inclusions and cracks within the context of stability and resolution, and introduces a topological derivative–based imaging framework for detecting elastic inclusions in the time-harmonic regime. For imaging extended elastic inclusions, accurate optimal control methodologies are designed and the effects of uncertainties of the geometric or physical parameters on stability and resolution properties are evaluated. In particular, the book shows how localized damage to a mechanical structure affects its dynamic characteristics, and how measured eigenparameters are linked to elastic inclusion or crack location, orientation, and size.

Knoll",NA; NA,"Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth - Updated Edition","","2015","","","","","Australopithecines, dinosaurs, trilobites--such fossils conjure up images of lost worlds filled with vanished organisms. But in the full history of life, ancient animals, even the trilobites, form only the half-billion-year tip of a nearly four-billion-year iceberg. Andrew Knoll explores the deep history of life from its origins on a young planet to the incredible Cambrian explosion, presenting a compelling new explanation for the emergence of biological novelty. The very latest discoveries in paleontology--many of them made by the author and his students--are integrated with emerging insights from molecular biology and earth system science to forge a broad understanding of how the biological diversity that surrounds us came to be. Moving from Siberia to Namibia to the Bahamas, Knoll shows how life and environment have evolved together through Earth's history. Innovations in biology have helped shape our air and oceans, and, just as surely, environmental change has influenced the course of evolution, repeatedly closing off opportunities for some species while opening avenues for others. Readers go into the field to confront fossils, enter the lab to discern the inner workings of cells, and alight on Mars to ask how our terrestrial experience can guide exploration for life beyond our planet. Along the way, Knoll brings us up-to-date on some of science's hottest questions, from the oldest fossils and claims of life beyond the Earth to the hypothesis of global glaciation and Knoll's own unifying concept of ''permissive ecology.'' In laying bare Earth's deepest biological roots, Life on a Young Planet helps us understand our own place in the universe--and our responsibility as stewards of a world four billion years in the making.In a new preface, Knoll describes how the field has broadened and deepened in the decade since the book's original publication.","","9781400866045","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452562.pdf&bkn=9452561&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Jung and Erich Neumann first met in 1933, at a seminar Jung was conducting in Berlin. Jung was fifty-seven years old and internationally acclaimed for his own brand of psychotherapy. Neumann, twenty-eight, had just finished his studies in medicine. The two men struck up a correspondence that would continue until Neumann's death in 1960. A lifelong Zionist, Neumann fled Nazi Germany with his family and settled in Palestine in 1934, where he would become the founding father of analytical psychology in the future state of Israel.Presented here in English for the first time are letters that provide a rare look at the development of Jung’s psychological theories from the 1930s onward as well as the emerging self-confidence of another towering twentieth-century intellectual who was often described as Jung’s most talented student. Neumann was one of the few correspondence partners of Jung’s who was able to challenge him intellectually and personally. These letters shed light on not only Jung’s political attitude toward Nazi Germany, his alleged anti-Semitism, and his psychological theory of fascism, but also his understanding of Jewish psychology and mysticism. They affirm Neumann’s importance as a leading psychologist of his time and paint a fascinating picture of the psychological impact of immigration on the German Jewish intellectuals who settled in Palestine and helped to create the state of Israel.Featuring Martin Liebscher’s authoritative introduction and annotations, this volume documents one of the most important intellectual relationships in the history of analytical psychology.","","9781400865918","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452478.pdf&bkn=9452477&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Einstein considered Bergson's theory of time to be a soft, psychological notion, irreconcilable with the quantitative realities of physics. Bergson, who gained fame as a philosopher by arguing that time should not be understood exclusively through the lens of science, criticized Einstein's theory of time for being a metaphysics grafted on to science, one that ignored the intuitive aspects of time. The Physicist and the Philosopher tells the remarkable story of how this explosive debate transformed our understanding of time and drove a rift between science and the humanities that persists today.Jimena Canales introduces readers to the revolutionary ideas of Einstein and Bergson, describes how they dramatically collided in Paris, and traces how this clash of worldviews reverberated across the twentieth century. She shows how it provoked responses from figures such as Bertrand Russell and Martin Heidegger, and carried repercussions for American pragmatism, logical positivism, phenomenology, and quantum mechanics. Canales explains how the new technologies of the period—such as wristwatches, radio, and film—helped to shape people’s conceptions of time and further polarized the public debate. She also discusses how Bergson and Einstein, toward the end of their lives, each reflected on his rival’s legacy—Bergson during the Nazi occupation of Paris and Einstein in the context of the first hydrogen bomb explosion.The Physicist and the Philosopher is a magisterial and revealing account that shows how scientific truth was placed on trial in a divided century marked by a new sense of time.","","9781400865772","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452344.pdf&bkn=9452343&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Sorrentino",NA,"Action-minimizing Methods in Hamiltonian Dynamics (MN-50): An Introduction to Aubry-Mather Theory","","2015","","","","","John Mather's seminal works in Hamiltonian dynamics represent some of the most important contributions to our understanding of the complex balance between stable and unstable motions in classical mechanics. His novel approach—known as Aubry-Mather theory—singles out the existence of special orbits and invariant measures of the system, which possess a very rich dynamical and geometric structure. In particular, the associated invariant sets play a leading role in determining the global dynamics of the system. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to Mather’s theory, and can serve as an interdisciplinary bridge for researchers and students from different fields seeking to acquaint themselves with the topic.Starting with the mathematical background from which Mather’s theory was born, Alfonso Sorrentino first focuses on the core questions the theory aims to answer—notably the destiny of broken invariant KAM tori and the onset of chaos—and describes how it can be viewed as a natural counterpart of KAM theory. He achieves this by guiding readers through a detailed illustrative example, which also provides the basis for introducing the main ideas and concepts of the general theory. Sorrentino then describes the whole theory and its subsequent developments and applications in their full generality.Shedding new light on John Mather’s revolutionary ideas, this book is certain to become a foundational text in the modern study of Hamiltonian systems.","","9781400866618","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452422.pdf&bkn=9452421&pdfType=book","John Mather;Hamiltonian dynamics;AubryЍather theory;classical mechanics;KAM theory;chaos;stable motion;unstable motion;orbits;Tonelli Lagrangians;Hamiltonians;compact manifold;Lagrangian dynamics;KAM tori;invariant Lagrangian graphs;invariant probability measures;action-minimizing measure;Maher sets;invariant sets;differentiability;strict convexity;pendulum;action-minimizing orbits;Aubry set;Ma set;Ma's potential;Peierls' barrier;Ma's critical value;Albert Fathi;MAK tori;HamiltonЊacobi equation","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

"16 Typical Examples from Cellular Standards","S. Kumar",NA,"Wireless Communication","","2015","","","549","588","Wireless communication is one of the fastest growing fields in the engineering world today. Rapid growth in the domain of wireless communication systems, services and application has drastically changed the way we live, work and communicate. Wireless communication offers a broad and dynamic technological field, which has stimulated incredible excitements and technological advancements over last few decades. The expectations from wireless communication technology are increasing every day. This is placing enormous challenges to wireless system designers. Moreover, this has created an ever increasing demand for conceptually strong and well versed communication engineers who understand the wireless technology and its future possibilities. In recent years, significant progress in wireless communication system design has taken place, which will continue in future. Especially for last two decades, the research contributions in wireless communication system design have resulted in several new concepts and inventions at remarkable speed. A text book is indeed required to offer familiarity with such developments and underlying concepts, to be taught in the classroom to future engineers. This is one of the motivations for writing this book. Practically no book can be up to date in this field, due to the fast ongoing research and developments. The new developments are announced almost every day. Teaching directly from the research papers in the classroom cannot build the necessary foundation. Therefore need for a textbook is unavoidable, which is integral to learning, and is an essential source to build the concept. The prime goal of this book is to cooperate in the learning process. This book is based on current research as well as classical text books in the field, and aims to provide in depth understanding on fundamental concepts, which form the basis of wireless communication and build the platform, on which current developments can be understood and future contributions can be made. This book is written in self-explanatory manner to facilitate critical thinking and to support self study. Special emphasis has been given in this book to systematically organize and present the wide domain of wireless communication technology. Extra care has been taken to present the contents and the concepts in user friendly way to enable an easy understanding. Therefore the language of this book is made to make one feel, listening to a classroom lecture. This makes learning straight forward. Sometimes, the explanation could seem to be oversimplified, this is in order to support wide spectrum of readers as well as to clarify the hazy picture. A book of this kind, which addresses a fast developing technology, the frequent use of acronyms and abbreviations is almost inevitable. A care has been taken to spell the acronyms and abbreviations as frequently as practically suitable in the text. Besides, a list of acronyms and abbreviations has also been provided.","","9788793102811","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227476.pdf&bkn=9218888&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Maintaining access control, authentication and managing the identity of devices while they interact with other devices, services and people is an important challenge for identity management. The identity management presents significant challenges in the current Internet communication. These challenges are exacerbated in the internet of things by the unbound number of devices and expected limitations in constrained resources. Current identity management solutions are mainly concerned with identities that are used by end users, and services to identify themselves in the networked world. However, these identity management solutions are designed by considering that significant resources are available and applicability of these identity management solutions to the resource constrained internet of things needs a thorough analysis. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Internet of Things; • Identity Management; • Identity models in Internet of Things; • Identity management and trust in the Internet of Things context; • Authentication and access control; Identitymanagement for Internet of Things contributes to the area of identity management for ubiquitous devices in the Internet of Things. It initially presents the motivational factors together with the identity management problems in the context of Internet of Things and proposes an identity management framework. Following this, it refers to the major challenges for Identitymanagement and presents different identity management models. This book also presents relationship between identity and trust, different approaches for trust management, authentication and access control.Key milestones identified for Identitymanagement are clustering with hierarchical addressing, trust management, mutual authentication and access control. Identitymanagement for Internet of Things is ideal forpersonnel in computer/communication industries as well as academic staff and master/research students in wireless communication, computer science, operational research, electrical engineering andtelecommunication systems Internet, and cloud computing.","","9788793102910","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227546.pdf&bkn=9218864&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The field of computer science has undergone tremendous change, and the rate of obsolescence of concepts, programming platforms, tools and utilities is extremely high. However, in spite of such vast changes, the only thing that has retained its stability is the 'C' language. Even today, millions of students, hobbyists and professional programmers enjoy the sturdiness, reliability and user friendliness of the 'C' language. Today 'C' enjoys the undisputable recognition in the computing paradigm for diversified applications, from the basic programming, microcontrollers, and spreadsheets to system programming. In this book, most of the usual theoretical features have been skipped, for these have been widely published in previous books. Rather than introducing the underpinning theory, the authors approach has been ""learning-through-doing"", which is one that often appeals to programmers. Theory is followed by practical implementation, and in this way the book will cover programming aspects in a self-tutor manner providing an excellent overview, from basic to advance programming. Topics discussed include: • GCC interface • First time 'C' User • Decision and looping structures • Arrays and pointers • Functions, structures and union • Linear data structures","","9788793237681","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227792.pdf&bkn=9218895&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"5 Identity Establishment","P. N. Mahalle; P. N. Railkar",NA; NA,"Identity Management for Internet of Things","","2015","","","103","128","The Internet of Things is a wide-reaching network of devices, and these devices can intercommunicate and collaborate with each other to produce variety of services at any time, any place, and in any way. Maintaining access control, authentication and managing the identity of devices while they interact with other devices, services and people is an important challenge for identity management. The identity management presents significant challenges in the current Internet communication. These challenges are exacerbated in the internet of things by the unbound number of devices and expected limitations in constrained resources. Current identity management solutions are mainly concerned with identities that are used by end users, and services to identify themselves in the networked world. However, these identity management solutions are designed by considering that significant resources are available and applicability of these identity management solutions to the resource constrained internet of things needs a thorough analysis. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Internet of Things; • Identity Management; • Identity models in Internet of Things; • Identity management and trust in the Internet of Things context; • Authentication and access control; Identitymanagement for Internet of Things contributes to the area of identity management for ubiquitous devices in the Internet of Things. It initially presents the motivational factors together with the identity management problems in the context of Internet of Things and proposes an identity management framework. Following this, it refers to the major challenges for Identitymanagement and presents different identity management models. This book also presents relationship between identity and trust, different approaches for trust management, authentication and access control.Key milestones identified for Identitymanagement are clustering with hierarchical addressing, trust management, mutual authentication and access control. Identitymanagement for Internet of Things is ideal forpersonnel in computer/communication industries as well as academic staff and master/research students in wireless communication, computer science, operational research, electrical engineering andtelecommunication systems Internet, and cloud computing.","","9788793102910","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227549.pdf&bkn=9218864&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The first three chapters answer the questions from the angle of abstract theory: what is the school culture and how is it managed? What is the school culture drive model? What is the school culture assessment? The two chapters thereafter solve major problems from the perspective of operations: how to develop the school culture solution and how to implement the school culture and promote cultural practices? The book concludes at the abstract theoretical level, on the position of sociological reflection, exploring what is the rationality and legitimacy of school culture and how does school culture happen? School Culture Improvement is one of the few school culture monographs which aims directly at management. Its contribution and features lie in two aspects: connecting school culture and school improvement and connecting research on project case and school culture, thus establishing a relatively complete system of school culture improvement theory. In this book, the author originates the following views and models: concept of school culture, school culture tripod structure theory, school culture spectrum theory, school culture drive model, and school culture unity and conflict.","","9788793237933","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227740.pdf&bkn=9218796&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

User requirements, therefore, cannot be used between projects, IT systems, and different software. That makes the elicitation of user requirements an inherent part of any software development project and a resourceful activity as well. This book provides insights to the process of identifying user requirements and to different types by describing varying case studies in which technologies or software has been developed. A variety of user requirements are provided illustrating the effect of changing the targeted user group with respect to age,; to the context and the different technologies or software as well as to the difference in viewpoint on ways of involving users in the elicitation process. Cases and user requirement elements discussed in the book include: • User requirements elicitation processes for children, construction workers, and farmers • User requirements for personalized services of a broadcast company • Variations in user involvement • Practical elements of user involvement and requirements elicitation • Usable security requirements for design of privacy","","9788793237612","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227550.pdf&bkn=9218873&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The first three chapters answer the questions from the angle of abstract theory: what is the school culture and how is it managed? What is the school culture drive model? What is the school culture assessment? The two chapters thereafter solve major problems from the perspective of operations: how to develop the school culture solution and how to implement the school culture and promote cultural practices? The book concludes at the abstract theoretical level, on the position of sociological reflection, exploring what is the rationality and legitimacy of school culture and how does school culture happen? School Culture Improvement is one of the few school culture monographs which aims directly at management. Its contribution and features lie in two aspects: connecting school culture and school improvement and connecting research on project case and school culture, thus establishing a relatively complete system of school culture improvement theory. In this book, the author originates the following views and models: concept of school culture, school culture tripod structure theory, school culture spectrum theory, school culture drive model, and school culture unity and conflict.","","9788793237933","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227737.pdf&bkn=9218796&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Today 'C' enjoys the undisputable recognition in the computing paradigm for diversified applications, from the basic programming, microcontrollers, and spreadsheets to system programming. In this book, most of the usual theoretical features have been skipped, for these have been widely published in previous books. Rather than introducing the underpinning theory, the authors approach has been ""learning-through-doing"", which is one that often appeals to programmers. Theory is followed by practical implementation, and in this way the book will cover programming aspects in a self-tutor manner providing an excellent overview, from basic to advance programming.

In practice, the identification of user needs and wants is a challenge and inadequate or faulty identifications in this step of an IT system development can cause huge problems with the final product. The elicitation of user requirements as such changes according to age groups;, to gender,; to cultural settings,; and into time; and experience in the use of the system/software. User requirements, therefore, cannot be used between projects, IT systems, and different software. That makes the elicitation of user requirements an inherent part of any software development project and a resourceful activity as well. This book provides insights to the process of identifying user requirements and to different types by describing varying case studies in which technologies or software has been developed. A variety of user requirements are provided illustrating the effect of changing the targeted user group with respect to age,; to the context and the different technologies or software as well as to the difference in viewpoint on ways of involving users in the elicitation process. Cases and user requirement elements discussed in the book include: • User requirements elicitation processes for children, construction workers, and farmers • User requirements for personalized services of a broadcast company • Variations in user involvement • Practical elements of user involvement and requirements elicitation • Usable security requirements for design of privacy","","9788793237612","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227510.pdf&bkn=9218873&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Moreover, this has created an ever increasing demand for conceptually strong and well versed communication engineers who understand the wireless technology and its future possibilities. In recent years, significant progress in wireless communication system design has taken place, which will continue in future. Especially for last two decades, the research contributions in wireless communication system design have resulted in several new concepts and inventions at remarkable speed. A text book is indeed required to offer familiarity with such developments and underlying concepts, to be taught in the classroom to future engineers. This is one of the motivations for writing this book. Practically no book can be up to date in this field, due to the fast ongoing research and developments. The new developments are announced almost every day. Teaching directly from the research papers in the classroom cannot build the necessary foundation. Therefore need for a textbook is unavoidable, which is integral to learning, and is an essential source to build the concept. The prime goal of this book is to cooperate in the learning process. This book is based on current research as well as classical text books in the field, and aims to provide in depth understanding on fundamental concepts, which form the basis of wireless communication and build the platform, on which current developments can be understood and future contributions can be made. This book is written in self-explanatory manner to facilitate critical thinking and to support self study. Special emphasis has been given in this book to systematically organize and present the wide domain of wireless communication technology. Extra care has been taken to present the contents and the concepts in user friendly way to enable an easy understanding. Therefore the language of this book is made to make one feel, listening to a classroom lecture. This makes learning straight forward. Sometimes, the explanation could seem to be oversimplified, this is in order to support wide spectrum of readers as well as to clarify the hazy picture. A book of this kind, which addresses a fast developing technology, the frequent use of acronyms and abbreviations is almost inevitable.

The field of computer science has undergone tremendous change, and the rate of obsolescence of concepts, programming platforms, tools and utilities is extremely high. However, in spite of such vast changes, the only thing that has retained its stability is the 'C' language. Even today, millions of students, hobbyists and professional programmers enjoy the sturdiness, reliability and user friendliness of the 'C' language. Today 'C' enjoys the undisputable recognition in the computing paradigm for diversified applications, from the basic programming, microcontrollers, and spreadsheets to system programming. In this book, most of the usual theoretical features have been skipped, for these have been widely published in previous books. Rather than introducing the underpinning theory, the authors approach has been ""learning-through-doing"", which is one that often appeals to programmers. Theory is followed by practical implementation, and in this way the book will cover programming aspects in a self-tutor manner providing an excellent overview, from basic to advance programming.

In practice, the identification of user needs and wants is a challenge and inadequate or faulty identifications in this step of an IT system development can cause huge problems with the final product. The elicitation of user requirements as such changes according to age groups;, to gender,; to cultural settings,; and into time; and experience in the use of the system/software. User requirements, therefore, cannot be used between projects, IT systems, and different software. That makes the elicitation of user requirements an inherent part of any software development project and a resourceful activity as well. This book provides insights to the process of identifying user requirements and to different types by describing varying case studies in which technologies or software has been developed. A variety of user requirements are provided illustrating the effect of changing the targeted user group with respect to age,; to the context and the different technologies or software as well as to the difference in viewpoint on ways of involving users in the elicitation process.

The field of computer science has undergone tremendous change, and the rate of obsolescence of concepts, programming platforms, tools and utilities is extremely high. However, in spite of such vast changes, the only thing that has retained its stability is the 'C' language. Even today, millions of students, hobbyists and professional programmers enjoy the sturdiness, reliability and user friendliness of the 'C' language. Today 'C' enjoys the undisputable recognition in the computing paradigm for diversified applications, from the basic programming, microcontrollers, and spreadsheets to system programming. In this book, most of the usual theoretical features have been skipped, for these have been widely published in previous books. Rather than introducing the underpinning theory, the authors approach has been ""learning-through-doing"", which is one that often appeals to programmers. Theory is followed by practical implementation, and in this way the book will cover programming aspects in a self-tutor manner providing an excellent overview, from basic to advance programming. Topics discussed include: • GCC interface • First time 'C' User • Decision and looping structures • Arrays and pointers • Functions, structures and union • Linear data structures","","9788793237681","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227738.pdf&bkn=9218895&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The two chapters thereafter solve major problems from the perspective of operations: how to develop the school culture solution and how to implement the school culture and promote cultural practices? The book concludes at the abstract theoretical level, on the position of sociological reflection, exploring what is the rationality and legitimacy of school culture and how does school culture happen? School Culture Improvement is one of the few school culture monographs which aims directly at management. Its contribution and features lie in two aspects: connecting school culture and school improvement and connecting research on project case and school culture, thus establishing a relatively complete system of school culture improvement theory.

Today 'C' enjoys the undisputable recognition in the computing paradigm for diversified applications, from the basic programming, microcontrollers, and spreadsheets to system programming. In this book, most of the usual theoretical features have been skipped, for these have been widely published in previous books. Rather than introducing the underpinning theory, the authors approach has been ""learning-through-doing"", which is one that often appeals to programmers.

These challenges are exacerbated in the internet of things by the unbound number of devices and expected limitations in constrained resources. Current identity management solutions are mainly concerned with identities that are used by end users, and services to identify themselves in the networked world. However, these identity management solutions are designed by considering that significant resources are available and applicability of these identity management solutions to the resource constrained internet of things needs a thorough analysis. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Internet of Things; • Identity Management; • Identity models in Internet of Things; • Identity management and trust in the Internet of Things context; • Authentication and access control; Identitymanagement for Internet of Things contributes to the area of identity management for ubiquitous devices in the Internet of Things. It initially presents the motivational factors together with the identity management problems in the context of Internet of Things and proposes an identity management framework. Following this, it refers to the major challenges for Identitymanagement and presents different identity management models. This book also presents relationship between identity and trust, different approaches for trust management, authentication and access control.Key milestones identified for Identitymanagement are clustering with hierarchical addressing, trust management, mutual authentication and access control. Identitymanagement for Internet of Things is ideal forpersonnel in computer/communication industries as well as academic staff and master/research students in wireless communication, computer science, operational research, electrical engineering andtelecommunication systems Internet, and cloud computing.","","9788793102910","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227487.pdf&bkn=9218864&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Several forecasting techniques for wind power ramp events have been reported. In this paper, the statistical scenarios forecasting method is proposed for wind power ramp event probabilistic forecasting based on the probability generating model. Multi-objective fitness functions are established considering cumulative density functions and higher order moment autocorrelation functions with respect to the consistency of distribution and timing characteristics, respectively. Parameters of probability generating model are calculated by the iterative optimization using the modified genetic algorithm with multi-objective fitness functions. A number of statistical scenarios captured bands are generated accordingly. Eventually, ramp event probability characteristics are detected from scenarios captured bands to evaluate the ramp event forecasting method. A wind plant of Bonneville Power Administration with actual wind power data is selected for calculation and statistical analysis. It is shown that statistical results with multi-objective functions are more accurate than the results with single objective functions. Moreover, the statistical scenarios forecasting method can accurately estimate the characteristics of wind power ramp events. The results verify that the proposed method can guide the generation method of statistical scenarios and forecasting models for ramp events.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0138-7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9027270","Neural networks;Genetic algorithm;Probability generating model;Statistical scenarios captured bands;Statistical scenarios forecasting;Wind power ramp events;Wind power","Wind power generation;Wind forecasting;Forecasting;Predictive models;Artificial neural networks;Correlation","","","","9","","23","","6 Mar 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

This paper proposes a quasi-automated generation control (QAGC) strategy to coordinate multiple ESSs, which responds to the grid dispatch demand rather than smoothing out the intermittent power from individual wind farms. The aims of QAGC are to ensure that multiple ESSs provide a service that is as balanced as possible, so more wind power systems at various scales can be accepted by the grid, as well maximizing the low-carbon benefits of ESSs.

"Bidding strategy for wind generation considering conventional generation and transmission constraints","H. Huang; F.

Development of wind generation is one potential solution to provide low-carbon electricity source. This paper researches operation of wind generation in a de-regulated power market. It develops bidding models under two schemes for variable wind generation to analyze the competition among generation companies (GENCOs) considering transmission constraints. The proposed method employs the supply function equilibrium (SFE) for modeling the bidding strategy of GENCOs. The bidding process is solved as a bi-level optimization problem. In the upper level, the profit of an individual GENCO is maximized; while in the lower level, the market clearing process of the independent system operator (ISO) is modeled to minimize the production cost. An intelligent search based on genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is applied to obtain the solution. The PJM five-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system are used for numerical studies. The results show when wind GENCOs play as strategic bidders to set the price, they can make significant profit uplifts as opposed to playing as a price taker, because the profit gain will outweigh the cost to cover wind uncertainty and reliability issues. However, this may result in an increase in total production cost and the profit of other units, which means consumers need to pay more. Thus, it is necessary to update the existing market architecture and structure considering these pros and cons in order to maintain a healthy competitive market.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0100-8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018439","Low carbon;Electricity market;Game theory;Generator bidding;Intermittency;Locational marginal pricing","Biological system modeling;ISO;Generators;Wind power generation;Production;Economics;Optimization;Global warming","","","","12","","28","","28 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

With a view to promote renewable energy sources, photovoltaics and wind turbines are integrated with the grid connected building. The system is modeled and the optimal system configuration is estimated with the help of hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER). The logic is illustrated with a case study based on the practical data of a building located in southern India. This building is associated with 3.4 MWh/day priority load (peak load as 422 kW), as well as 3.3 MWh/day deferrable load (peak load as 500 kW). Sensitivity analysis is performed to deal with uncertainties such as the increase in electricity consumption and grid tariff, environmental changes, etc. From the simulation result, it is observed that the designed system is cost effective and environment friendly, which leads to 6.18 % annual cost savings and reduces CO2 emissions by 38.3 %. Sensitivity results indicate that the system is optimal and adaptable in a certain range of unanticipated variances with respect to best estimated value.

Wind generation is a major technology of generating electric power with zero carbon dioxide emission. In a power system with the high penetration of wind generation, the displacement of conventional synchronous generators with variable speed wind turbines reduces system inertia. This leads to larger system frequency deviation following a loss of large generation. In this paper, the impact of the reduction of system inertia on system frequency is analyzed as the result of the integration of a significant amount of wind generation into power systems. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study of the impact of the distribution of the inertia contributions from those online conventional synchronous generators on the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) based on the total energy injected into the system due to the fault. The total fault energy is represented using Hamiltonian formulism. With the IEEE 39-bus system, it is shown that for a fault with the given injected total energy, clearing time, and location, the distribution of inertia contributions can significantly affect the magnitude of ROCOF. Moreover, for such a fault with different locations, the average of the magnitudes of ROCOF caused by the fault at different locations is larger when the distribution of the inertia contributions is more dispersed.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-014-0093-8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018442","Carbon dioxide emission;Wind generation;System inertia;Rate of change of frequency","Generators;Potential energy;Power system stability;Wind power generation;Power system dynamics;Wind turbines;Circuit faults","","","","11","","19","","28 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Therefore, whole-system thinking is needed to support the development control of EVs, with a broader scope than operational control, and the core issue is the interaction between EVs and power grid, including their coordinated development and operational management. For development control of EVs, a target system and a step-wise optimization method are presented, as well as the basic principles for designing the target system. There are two key barriers in EVs' development: the research and mass production of highperformance power batteries, and the formulation of a favorable mechanism to capture benefits and encourage development.

Based on the wind speed, the operating regions of the WT are divided into two parts: below and above the rated wind speed. The main aim at below rated wind speed is to maximize the energy capture from the wind with reduced oscillation on the drive train. At above rated wind speed, the aim is to maintain the rated power by using pitch control. This paper presents the control of WT at below rated wind speed by using backstepping sliding mode control (BSMC). In BSMC, generator torque is considered as the control input that depends on the optimal rotor speed. Usually, this optimal rotor speed is derived from effective wind speed. In this paper, effective wind speed is estimated from aerodynamic torque and rotor speed by using the modified Newton Rapshon (MNR) algorithm. Initially, a conventional sliding mode controller (SMC) is applied to the WT, but the performance of the controller was found to be less robust with respect to disturbances. Generally, WT external disturbance is not predictable. To overcome the above drawback, BSMC is proposed and both the controllers are tested with mathematical model and finally validated with the fatigue, aerodynamics, structures, and turbulence (FAST) WT simulator in the presence of disturbances. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed BSMC is more robust than conventional SMC in the presence of disturbances.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0106-2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005353","Nonlinear control;Single mass model;Modified Newton Raphson (MNR);Backstepping sliding mode control (BSMC)","Wind speed;Aerodynamics;Mathematical model;Rotors;Torque;Wind turbines;Sliding mode control","","","","7","","18","","20 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

However, the uncertain wind power generation (WG) which has anti-peaking characteristic would be hard to exert its ability in carbon reduction. This paper introduces DR into traditional unit commitment (UC) strategy and proposes a multi-objective day-ahead optimal scheduling model for wind farm integrated power systems, since incentive-based DR can accommodate excess wind power and can be used as a source of system spinning reserve to alleviate generation side reserve pressure during both peak and valley load periods. Firstly, net load curve is obtained by forecasting load and wind power output.

To fulfill the automatic generation control (AGC) and compensate the influence of wind power fluctuations simultaneously, ramping capacity should be considered in the dispatch model of thermals. Meanwhile, conventional methods in this area do not take the impact of transmission loss into the dispatch model, or rely on offline network model and parameters, failing to reflect the real relationships between the wind farms and thermal generators. This paper proposes an online approach for AGC dispatch units considering the above issues. Firstly, the power loss sensitivity is online identified using recursive least square method based on the real-time data of phasor measurement units. It sets up power balance constraint and results in a more accurate dispatch model. Then, an improved multi-objective optimization model of dispatch is proposed and a connection is established between the thermal units with fast ramping capacity and the wind farms with rapid fluctuations. Genetic algorithm is used to solve the dispatch model. The proposed method is compared with conventional methods in simulation case in the IEEE 30-bus system. Finally, simulation results verify the validity and the feasibility of identification method and optimization model.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0141-z","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005361","Ramping capacity;Loss sensitivity;Automatic generation control (AGC) optimal dispatch;On-line identification;Genetic algorithm","Propagation losses;Automatic generation control;Sensitivity;Real-time systems;Wind power generation;Loss measurement;Optimization","","","","3","","15","","20 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

A reversible circuit can be envisaged as a cascade of reversible gates only, such as Toffoli gate, which has two components: k control bits and a target bit (k-CNOT), k ⩾ 1. While analyzing testability issues in a reversible circuit, the missing-gate fault model is often used for modeling physical defects in quantum k-CNOT gates. In this paper, we propose a new design-for-testability (DFT) technique for quantum reversible circuits that deploys bit-swapping using Fredkin gates. It is shown that in an (n x n) circuit implemented with k-CNOT gates, addition of only two extra inputs along with a few Fredkin gates yields easy testability in the circuit. The modified design admits a universal test set of size (n + k + 2) that detects all detectable missing gate faults in the original circuit, where k is the maximum number of controls used among all k-CNOT gates. The DFT overhead in terms of quantum cost is also much less compared to previous approaches.","2377-5386","978-1-4673-9739-1","10.1109/ATS.2015.8125669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125669","Missing-gate fault;quantum computing;reversible logic;test generation","Logic gates;Circuit faults;Integrated circuit modeling;Discrete Fourier transforms;Logic circuits;Quantum computing;Testing","design for testability;fault diagnosis;logic circuits;logic design;logic testing;quantum gates","quantum cost;universal test set;DFT technique;physical defect modelling;ultralow-power quantum computing systems;missing gate fault detection;Toffoli gate;reversible gates;quantum reversible logic circuits;Fredkin gates;bit-swapping;design-for-testability technique;quantum k-CNOT gates;missing-gate fault model;reversible circuit;target bit;k control bits","","","","15","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current works focus on sequential single pair-wise contacts among people under homogeneous mobility and single data source. This restricted evaluation for only single-scenarios do not collectively consider real-world mobility aspects of data dissemination. This approach based on narrow mobility aspects is mainly imposed due to intrinsic complexity of real-world. Deploying real experiments or simulating these real-world scenarios can be exhaustive and impractical. To include real-world mobility aspects and allow the understanding of scenarios bounds, we present a Markov model that collectively considers them to predict the performance of data dissemination. Our model allows multiple simultaneous pair-wise contacts among people under heterogeneous mobility and predicts the upper bound of data dissemination time. We achieve tighter upper bound of dissemination time than existing approaches by utilizing the long tail cut-off property of inter contact time distribution and data gathering process. We validate our model through different real-world traces from diverse environments and obtained the upper bound of data dissemination time with 5-10% error.

The new standards require a flexible operation of generation plants that have to be capable to change the active and reactive power dynamically in function of the network parameters (i.e. frequency and network local voltage) in local control or following external commands. Therefore, this paper investigates the use of smart inverter in a critical PV installation, where relevant voltage fluctuations exist.

In this context, traditional centralized control paradigms may suffer in terms of the timeliness of optimization results due to the volume of data to be processed and the delayed asynchronous nature of the data transmission. To address these limits of centralized control, this paper presents a coordinated, distributed algorithm based on distributed, local controllers and a central coordinator for exchanging summarized global state information. The proposed model for exchanging global state information is resistant to fluctuations caused by the inherent interdependence between local controllers, and is robust to delays in information exchange. In addition, the algorithm features iterative refinement of local state estimations that is able to improve local controller ability to operate within network constraints. Application of the proposed coordinated, distributed algorithm through simulation shows its effectiveness in optimizing a global goal within a complex distribution system operating under constraints, while ensuring network operation stability under varying levels of information exchange delay, and with a range of network sizes.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0168-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946680","Smart grid;Distributed optimization;Demand-side management;Distributed generation;Distributed storage;Approximate dynamic programming","Smart grids;Optimization;Dynamic programming;Information exchange;Delays;Distributed algorithms;Stochastic processes","","","","11","","51","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

During the period when only one phase circuit is opened, negative sequence voltage with certain duration is obtained at DG side because of the asymmetric operation of the system. After all three phase circuits are opened, the voltage variation direction of the two phases that are secondly disconnected from the grid follows the voltage variation direction of the firstly disconnected phase. Based on the above voltage characteristics, an islanding detection scheme is proposed to identify genuine islanding from system disturbances.

A voltage closed-loop controller and a current closed-loop controller are designed to achieve both functions of DG real power generation and harmonics compensation. Therefore, the traditional harmonic measurement devices installed at the bus as well as the long distance communication between the bus and the DG converter are not required.

This is realized with the aid of the outage probability (OP) criterion in the context of cooperative communications, which is widely considered in modern wireless communication systems. The main usefulness of this method is that it allows the involved components to communicate to each-other by means of a robust and flexible wireless sensor network architecture. In this context, any conventional medium voltage (MV) bus of the PDN is represented as a wireless relay node where data signals gathered from each MV bus can be forwarded reliably to a control station for the subsequent processing. The received signals at wireless nodes are decoded and then forwarded to ensure minimal errors and maximal robustness at the receiving site. The considered OP analysis denotes the probability that the power of a received information signal drops below a pre-defined threshold which satisfies the acceptable Quality of Service requirements of a reliable signal reception. To this end, simple closed-form expressions are proposed for the OP of a regenerative cooperative-based PDN in the presence of various multipath fading effects, which degrade information signals during wireless transmission. The offered results are rather simple and provide meaningful insights for the design and deployment of smart grid systems.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0133-z","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940922","Smart grid;Cooperative communications (CCs);Power distribution network (PDN);Outage probability;Renewable energy source (RES);Wireless sensor network (WSN)","Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Relays;Fading channels;Reliability;Power system reliability;Renewable energy sources","","","","3","","29","","24 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

As most abnormal ST segments sustain for only a few seconds, it is impractical for the doctors to detect and classify abnormal ones manually on time. Even though many ST segment classification algorithms are proposed to meet the rising demand of automatic myocardial ischemia diagnosis, they are often with lower recognition rate. The aim of this study is to detect abnormal ST segments precisely and classify them into more categories, and thus provide more detailed category information to help the clinicians make decisions. This study sums up ten common abnormal ST segments according to the clinical ECG records and proposes a morphological classification algorithm of ST segment based on multi-features. This algorithm consists of two parts: Feature points extraction and ST segment classification. In the first part, R wave is detected by using the 2B-spline wavelet transform, and mode-filtering method and morphological characteristics are used for other feature points extraction. In the ST segment classification process, ST segment level, variance, slope value, number of convex/concave points and other feature parameters are employed to classify the ST segment. This algorithm can classify abnormal ST segments into ten categories above. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm based on ECG data in the European ST-T database. The global recognition rate of 92.7% and the best accuracy of 97% demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7319718","","","diseases;electrocardiography;feature extraction;filtering theory;medical signal detection;patient diagnosis;signal classification;splines (mathematics);wavelet transforms","multifeature based morphological algorithm;global recognition rate;ECG data;mode filtering method;automatic myocardial ischemia diagnosis;2B-spline wavelet transform;convex-concave points;feature point extraction;morphological classification algorithm;ST segment classification algorithms;ST shape classification;European ST-T database;abnormal ST segment","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Electrocardiography;Humans;Myocardial Ischemia;Wavelet Analysis","","","11","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-view stereo algorithms are able to construct highly detailed 3D models from images alone. They take a possibly very large set of images and construct a 3D plausible geometry that explains the images under some reasonable assumptions, the most important being scene rigidity. Multi-View Stereo: A Tutorial frames the multiview stereo problem as an image/geometry consistency optimization problem. It describes in detail its main two ingredients: robust implementations of photometric consistency measures, and efficient optimization algorithms. It then presents how these main ingredients are used by some of the most successful algorithms, applied into real applications, and deployed as products in the industry. Finally, it describes more advanced approaches exploiting domain-specific knowledge such as structural priors, and gives an overview of the remaining challenges and future research directions.","","9781601988379","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8637126.pdf&bkn=8637125&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","11 Feb 2019","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

With a very few and distant cardiac hospitals present in developing countries like Pakistan, people especially living in remote areas have no access to the cardiologists. This paper presents development of a portable system for real time analysis of ECG signals, capable of monitoring and detecting abnormalities occurring in the heart activity without the help of an expert. It can either be used as an intelligent holter device or an advanced warning device. It is very important for a range of clinical and diagnostic devices. The proposed portable system uses an online ECG library of patient data, which is filtered for noise firstly, and then the features present on the strip of ECG i.e., QRS complex, RR interval, ST segment and p wave are extracted. Early changes in the heart muscle activity after a heart disease reflects on these points, thus with the help of these features the system then classifies the ECG signal as normal or abnormal using real time algorithms for the early diagnosis of four various heart diseases. The results are then updated on the hospital's server wirelessly thus reducing the communication gap between a doctor and patient.","","978-1-4673-7983-0","10.1109/BIBE.2015.8631286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631286","","Electrocardiography;Heart;Wavelet transforms;Diseases;Turning;Feature extraction;Signal processing algorithms","diseases;electrocardiography;feature extraction;filtering theory;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;signal classification;signal denoising","heart muscle activity;p wave;ST segment;RR interval;QRS complex;feature extraction;noise filtering;patient data;online ECG library;network enabled cardiac monitor;real time analysis;ECG signal classification;cardiologists;remote areas;Pakistan;distant cardiac hospitals;timely medical actions;stroke count;heart diseases;diagnostic devices;clinical devices;advanced warning device;intelligent holter device;abnormalities;portable system","","","","15","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work presents an expanded parameter Call Admission Control (CAC) scheme and intelligent scheduling to provide QoS on modern networks. The expanded parameter CAC scheme features the lower layers Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) and network delay as admission parameters. The SIR is due to the transmission on the code division multiple access network and delay is due to the operation of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP delay is a good representative of the aggregated delays of the entire network; both access and core network as it is at a higher layer. TCP was ideally designed for wired networks. TCP performance is degraded and leads to substantial delay while operating on wireless lossy links as it reduces the sending rate and resends lost packets. This work presents an analytical framework for evaluating the performance of a wireless TCP based CAC model which features Batch Markovian Arrival Process (BMAP) traffic, a better representative of the future traffic characteristics than the traditional Poisson traffic. A teletraffic analysis of a network with TCP is done and the impact of TCP induced delays on the network is investigated for a future generation CAC scheme.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531937","BMAP;Call admission control;CDMA;Multimedia traffic;TCP","Delays;Wireless communication;Protocols;Analytical models;Quality of service;Multiaccess communication;Packet loss","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

This is mainly due to the rapid advances made in Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) technology. The use of AMBs in FES systems results in a drastic increase in their efficiency. Another key component of a flywheel system is the control strategy. In the past, decentralised control strategies implementing PID control, proved very effective and robust. In this paper, the performance of an advanced centralised control strategy namely, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is investigated. It is an optimal Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) control strategy that utilises a system model and an optimisation algorithm to determine the optimal control law. A first principle state space model is derived for the purpose of the MPC control strategy. The designed MPC controller is evaluated both in simulation and experimentally at a low operating speed as a proof of concept. The experimental and simulated results are compared by means of a sensitivity analysis. The controller showed good performance, however further improvements need to be made in order to sustain good performance and stability at higher speeds. In this paper advantages of incorporating a system model in a model-based strategy such as MPC are illustrated. MPC also allows for incorporating system and control constraints into the control methodology allowing for better efficiency and reliability capabilities.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531940","state space model;model predictive control;flywheel energy storage system;active magnetic bearings","Rotors;Iron;Force;Magnetic levitation;Mathematical model;Stators;Flywheels","","","","3","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

We discuss the different impulse noise models in the literature, focusing on their similarities and differences when applied in communications systems. The impulse noise models discussed are memoryless (Middleton Class A, Bernoulli-Gaussian and Symmetric alpha-stable), and with memory (Markov-Middleton and Markov-Gaussian). We then go further to give performance comparisons in terms of bit error rates for some of the variants of impulse noise models. We also compare the bit error rate performance of single-carrier (SC) and multi-carrier (MC) communications systems operating under impulse noise. It can be seen that MC is not always better than SC under impulse noise. Lastly, the known impulse noise mitigation schemes (clipping/nulling using thresholds, iterative based and error control coding methods) are discussed.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531938","Impulse noise models;Multi-carrier modulation;Single-carrier modulation;Bernoulli-Gaussian;Middleton Class A;Symmetric alpha-stable distribution","Probability density function;Indexes;Communication systems;IEEE Sections;Modulation;Receivers;Mathematical model","","","","43","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Government's offering of incentives was intended to lessen the cost of local industry's expensive, but necessary investment. Despite the growth, industry trade balance has been declining systematically. To explain the apparent contradiction in industry performance, a model of South Africa's automotive incentives – including the Productive Asset Allowance (PAA) and the Import-Export Complementation (IEC) – was developed. Model simulations reveal that, while the IEC had a significant effect on the industry trade balance, the role of the PAA in this regard is trivial. Ultimately, the study reveals that combining strictly investment incentives with other ‘non-investment’ incentives can have unintended consequences for the local automotive industry.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531941","Investment incentives;robotic automotive manufacturing;system dynamics;competitiveness","Industries;Investment;Automotive engineering;Production;Modeling;Manufacturing;IEC","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Furthermore, power cables are increasingly being used to simultaneously convey electric energy as well as communication signals in technologies such as smart grids. In operation, power cables experience wide ranging temperature variations due to changes in the load current flowing through the cable. It is therefore necessary to understand the effect of temperature variations on the high frequency characteristics of power cables. Simulations and experimental tests performed in this study show that temperature variations introduce errors in TDR measurements. It is also shown that when temperature in the cable changes from 22°C to 58°C, attenuation increases by one order of magnitude while the propagation velocity increases by an average of 4%. The phase constant however decreases by an average of one order of magnitude. The implications of the findings are that temperature effects have to be taken into account when designing communication channels in power cables.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531486","Power cables;partial discharges;TDR;smart grids;PLC;temperature;attenuation;phase constant;propagation velocity","Power cables;Temperature measurement;Partial discharges;Temperature;Oil filled cables;Circuit faults;Ocean temperature","","","","3","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

For this type of fault the sequence networks are connected in series and solved to obtain the sequence currents and voltages at the fault point. These are then used to determine the symmetrical component voltages at the other bus bars and the symmetrical component currents in the lines. The phase quantities are obtained by transformation. In this approach, the connection of the sequence networks must be known for the fault. In contrast, the solution by the general method of fault admittance matrix does not require prior knowledge of how the sequence networks are connected. It is therefore more versatile than the classical methods. It does however require the fault admittance matrix at the fault point. For a line-to-ground fault, of zero impedance, the fault admittance matrix is infinite and has to be simulated. The paper presents a procedure for simulating the short circuit, a requirement for using the general fault admittance method.

The focus of LTE-Advance (LTE-A) networks is to provide enhanced capacity and reliability of radio access as well as broadband demand for mobile users. The necessity to maintain quality of service, especially for the delay sensitive data services and applications, has made mobility and handover decisions between the base stations in the LTE networks critical. Unfortunately, several handover decision algorithms in the LTE networks are based on the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained as a linear averaging over the reference signals. The critical challenge with the linear averaging technique is that the limited reference signal available in the downlink packet introduces an estimation error. This estimation error is a result of the effects of linear averaging on propagation loss components in eliminating fast-fading from the received signals. Moreover, prompt and precise handover decisions cannot be based on inaccurate measurement. The standardized LTE layer 3 filtering technique is applied to the local averaged layer 1 signal to render it suitable for LTE handover decisions. The local averaging technique produces better handover than the linear averaging technique in terms of the reduced number of handover failures, improved high spectral efficiency and increased throughput, especially for cell-edge users with high speeds. The findings of this study suggest that the local averaging technique enhances mobility performance of LTE-Advance networks.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531649","averaging;evolution;filtering;handover;signal;network","Handover;Channel estimation;Long Term Evolution;Filtering;Frequency-domain analysis;OFDM","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Air comprises of nitrogen and oxygen and the corona process involves many complex phenomena including ionisation, attachment and excitation and the interaction of the ions and excited molecules generated by these phenomena. A particular state of excited molecular oxygen, singlet oxygen, has the characteristic that it remains excited for a relatively long period of time. Singlet oxygen plays a role in the detachment of electrons from the negative oxygen ions and its role in corona discharges has been accounted for through theory and models, but due to the difficulties of measurement of the singlet oxygen, the influence it does have on corona discharges is not entirely clear. On this basis the gas processes associated with the corona discharge in air have been explored, where a Boltzmann equation solver, the electron energy distribution function, transport coefficient and Townsend coefficients are used to understand the phenomena and provide input to a gas discharge model, where the gases are representing as species in a drift-diffusion model. The model indicates the presence of negative ions and singlet oxygen, but clearly illustrates how the space charge plays the critical role in positive corona due to the collapse of the electric field. An experiment that involved altering the environment with air-flow produced an unexpected result in the positive onset streamers where the repetition rate changed considerably, initially it was thought that this was due to the removal of singlet oxygen. In an effort to determine if their was a relationship between repetition rate and singlet oxygen, experiments detecting the emission from singlet oxygen and exciting oxygen through a laser were undertaken. There was no evidence to suggest that the repetition rate of the positive onset streamers could be related to singlet oxygen. There were no emissions detected from various configurations, whilst visible corona was clearly seen. The experiment where laser induced excitation showed no change in repetition rate. It could be inferred that a relationship between repetition rate and that the detachment due to negative ions and singlet oxygen is not a dominant process in the corona discharge.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531646","Corona;Positive onset streamers;Space charge;Singlet oxygen","Corona;Discharges (electric);Space charge;Ionization;Mathematical model;Conductors","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

In many cases, an enterprise will conduct an internal investigation against some allegation of wrongdoing by an employee, or a client. In these cases maintaining the privacy promise made to other clients or customers is an ideal that the enterprise may wish to honour, especially if the image or brand of the enterprise may be impacted when the details of the process followed during the investigation becomes clear. Moreover, there may be a duty to honour the privacy of third parties (through legislation or best practice).

Well-known security models as the multiple independent levels of security (MILS) aim to formalise the isolation of compartments to avoid interference and make them reliable to work in safety critical environments. Especially for in-car multimedia systems, also known as In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems, the composition of compartments onto a system-on-chip (SoC) offers a wide variety of advantages in embedded system development. The development of such systems implies often the combination of pre-qualified hardware- and software components. These components are CPU subsystems and operating systems, for example. However, the required strict separation can suffer due to the pre-qualified and therefore not reconfigurable hardware components. Particularly, this is true for shared cache levels in CPU subsystems. The phenomena of interference in the concurrent usage of shared last-level caches, are exploitable by adversaries. Therefore, this article identifies the attack surface and proposes a mitigation to prevent from the intentional misuse of the fixed cache association. Generally, the solution is based on a suitable mapping scheme in the intermediate address space of an asymmetric multiprocessing environment which implements the MCS. Furthermore, we evaluate the strength of the approach and show how the solution contributes to a separation property conformal system.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531890","security architecture;shared cache;denial of service;proof of separability","Security;Hardware;Interference;System-on-chip;Multicore processing;Safety","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

This paper firstly attempts to establish if triggers could be used as an anti-forensic mechanism in databases to potentially disrupt or even thwart forensic investigations. Secondly, it explores if triggers could be used to manipulate ordinary database actions for nefarious purposes and at the same time implicate innocent parties. The database triggers as defined in the SQL standard were studied together with a number of database trigger implementations. This was done in order to establish what aspects of a trigger might have an impact on digital forensic analysis. It is demonstrated in this paper that certain database forensic acquisition and analysis methods are impacted by the possible presence of non-data triggers. This is specific to databases that provide non-data trigger implementations. Furthermore, it finds that the forensic interpretation and attribution processes should be extended to include the handling and analysis of all database triggers. This is necessary to enable a more accurate attribution of actions in all databases that provide any form of trigger implementations.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531887","database forensics;database triggers;digital forensic analysis;methods;processes","Databases;Standards;Digital forensics;Information systems;Servers;Roads","","","","1","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

To combat these defensive techniques, this paper presents a sandbox-based environment that aims to accurately mimic a vulnerable host and is capable of semi-automatic semantic dissection and syntactic deobfuscation of PHP code.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531886","Code deobfuscation;Sandboxing;Reverse engineering","Servers;Syntactics;Java;Programming;Trojan horses;Semantics","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

"Bird and Tyre Impact Analysis on Landing Gear (2013-01-9002)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Landing Gear","","2015","","","71","80","As part of the aircraft certification process, landing gear has to be certified against particular risks such as bird and tyre impact cases.According to international aviation regulations, it has to be demonstrated that the landing gear is designed to ensure the capability for continued safe flight and landing after bird impact or after tyre impact resulting from wheel or tyre failure.Structural parts such as the down-lock mechanism must be validated against these requirements since their structural integrity is essential to ensure landing gear down-locking for landing and subsequent on ground movement.Recently, MESSIER-BUGATTI-DOWTY has been involved in the development of explicit analysis in support of bird and tyre impact justification.A model of the down-lock mechanism has been developed and a full scale test has been set up in order to demonstrate the validity of the analysis.Two extensive test campaigns have been performed considering bird and tyre impact cases using highly instrumented components to record strains and displacements on impacted parts.Based on a comparison to the test results, the modelling of bird and tyre projectiles has been validated. The computed displacements and strains in the down-lock mechanism have also been favourably compared with experimental evidence.Based on these results, a model of the complete landing gear has been built in order to take into account the effect of landing gear stiffness and to re run analysis in the complete landing gear environment.","","9780768082463","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505297.pdf&bkn=8504905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Aircraft Level Steering Runaway Failure Analysis (2009-01-3136)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Landing Gear","","2015","","","65","70","Integration of aircraft landing gear systems requires a high level of knowledge and understanding of these systems and how they contribute to aircraft performance. This paper considers a specific design requirement for the steering system. Failure of the steering system, resulting in the aircraft leaving the runway at high speed, can be considered hazardous or even catastrophic. The ability of the system to detect such a failure and take appropriate action is a key aspect of the design. This paper describes an aircraft level steering runaway failure analysis using an aircraft level mechanical and hydraulic control coupled simulation model.The aircraft level simulation model includes aircraft structure, weight and inertia. Appropriate loads and forces (engine thrust, aerodynamic forces, lift, drag) and moments are then applied. The model also includes nose and main landing gears, brakes and tires. The steering system model includes all hydraulic and control components, with failure triggers and steering failure detection logic.The aircraft level steering runaway failure analysis is carried out under different aircraft operations (taxi speeds, weights) in order to identify the most severe condition. In this model, differential braking is applied to simulate a pilot corrective action after the failure is detected.The analysis results show that the aircraft level steering model is able to determine the aircraft landing gear deviation from the runway centerline under failure conditions, with and without pilot corrective actions, and to assess the pilot reaction time required to bring the aircraft back to its runway centerline after the failure occurs.This analysis can be performed during early design stage to evaluate steering system sizing and other performance characteristics and the particular dynamic characteristics of the steering controller.This paper is addressed to the landing gear system performance specialists, who analyze similar conditions, to allow comparison of methods and results.","","9780768082463","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504906.pdf&bkn=8504905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"An Investigation of Landing Gear Shimmy: Tire Models, Tire Test Methodologies, Analysis, and Parameter Studies (1999-01-5527)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Landing Gear","","2015","","","37","64","This paper presents typical tire models used by the aerospace community for studying landing gear shimmy. Closed form solutions were developed for the tire models and fit to different types of laboratory tire data. The laboratory tests include the traditional windup tests on a Tire Force Machine, dynamic non-rolling tests on the dynamometer and tire force machine, and dynamic yaw and rolling tests on the dynamometer. Both bias and radial tire designs were studied in both the new and worn condition. Based on the testing performed, significantly different tire property information is obtained. For example, torsional stiffness measured for the non-rolling condition was nearly three times larger than that measured for the rolling tire. Also, very large differences in the torsional damping coefficient between tire types were only evident through dynamic yaw and rolling testing. A discrete landing gear shimmy model was developed to study the effects of tire type and other landing gear parameters. It was determined that the radial tire is less prone to self-excite in shimmy due to the larger torsional damping coefficient. In the worn condition, both the radial and bias tires become more prone to self-shimmy excitation. However, at higher speeds, effect of tire configuration becomes less significant. Effect of mass damping and friction was also studied and analytical stability simulations were performed. Full scale laboratory shimmy testing was performed on the dynamometer to study the effects of tire type, mass damping and friction. In all cases, the analysis agreed well with experimental observations. Testing revealed that the worn bias tire was the least stable since it was most prone to self excite in shimmy at relatively low speeds. Effects of adding mass and friction were shown to add significant stability to the gear.","","9780768082463","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505348.pdf&bkn=8504905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"An Automatic Procedure for the Landing Gear Conceptual Design of a Light Unmanned Aircraft (2013-01-2188)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Landing Gear","","2015","","","23","36","In this paper an automatic procedure aimed at preliminary designing an oleo-pneumatic landing gear strut for a light unmanned aircraft is presented.The whole work is motivated by the necessity to design the landing gear of the unmanned aircraft X-MALE, currently in development at the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA SCpA), according to the Airworthiness Requirements NATO STANAG 4671 (USAR).The landing gear preliminary design is usually carried-out by responding to requirements of maximum overall dimensions, maximum weight and maximum attainable load factor. While the oleo-pneumatic mechanism depends essentially on the maximum vertical load factor and on the strut length, thus on the oleo-pneumatic efficiency, the structure is generally sized by combining the design vertical loads with the maximum expected horizontal loads. The horizontal drag component simulating the force required to accelerate the tyres and wheels up to the landing speed (spin-up) and the forward-acting horizontal load resulting from rapid reduction of the spin-up drag loads (spring-back) have to be calculated.Differently from other Airworthiness Requirements for piloted aircraft, USAR.479, “Level Landing” imposes that, in the absence of specific experimental tests, the determination of spin-up and spring-back maximum loads must be carried-out by means of more rational analysis.The procedure is made of the following steps: first static sizing of the strut structure under maximum expected vertical loads, selection of oleo-pneumatic chamber architecture and choice of minimum operating pressure and pressure ratios, run of dynamic landing for orifice sizing and calculation of maximum spin-up and spring-back loads, re-sizing of the strut structure under combined vertical and calculated horizontal loads.The horizontal loads due to a dynamic landing depend on the stiffness and inertia distribution along the landing gear strut. Since these distributions are modified by the re-sizing following the dynamic landing analysis, the final solution (in terms of piston and cylinder wall thicknesses and orifice diameter) is found in an iterative manner.Calculations performed for the X-MALE landing gear conceptual design show that the convergence to a final solution respecting all given requirements is reached in few iterations. The method presented herein can be used also to simulate and set-up the dynamic drop test of an existing oleo-pneumatic landing gear.","","9780768082463","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505530.pdf&bkn=8504905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Hardware Design and Implementation of the Landing Gear Control Algorithm (2014-01-2186)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Landing Gear","","2015","","","115","123","Since the early 1970s, when microprocessors became commercially available, they quickly became a common part of all aircraft control and indication systems. With an ever-increasing number of microprocessor-based airborne applications, safety regulations and software standards like RTCA DO-178 evolved, demanding rigorous requirements and processes for software development, testing, life cycle, and certification. Over the years, as development of aerospace software applications increased, engineering costs of development and product certification costs exponentially increased, having a significant impact on the market.Landing Gear Actuation system is one of many aircraft systems whose control functions are based on microprocessors and software application. Considering that Landing Gear Actuation control algorithm can be defined in a form of the State Machine, this article intends to demonstrate that such controller can be realized as wired logic hardware, without software implementation. Control algorithm and logic structures were defined based on generic aircraft Landing Gear Actuation system, which is common for many midsize commercial aircraft. A full functionality of the control algorithm was defined and simulated together with the initial conditions, power up recovery states, and reverse commands.Although Landing Gear Actuation control is an aircraft safety critical function, the presented design and hardware implementation in accordance with RTCA DO-254 can qualify as “Simple Electronic Hardware.” With such design concept, cost of development, implementation, and certification can be significantly reduced compared with the same controller realized with microprocessors and software.","","9780768082463","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505505.pdf&bkn=8504905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Optimal Control Allocation for Electric Aircraft Taxi Systems: A Preliminary Study (2014-01-2137)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Landing Gear","","2015","","","91","99","Demonstrators and research projects about electric aircraft taxi systems testify the current interest in low- or zero-emission ground propulsion technologies to lower the overall fuel consumption and emissions of commercial flights. Electric motors fitted in the main landing gears are one of the most promising layouts for these systems especially for narrow-body commercial aircraft. From a control theory point of view, the aircraft on ground becomes an over-actuated plant through adoption of this technology, i.e. a commanded ground trajectory can be reached through different combinations of actuator efforts. A strategy is required to choose the most suitable of these combinations in order to reach the best efficiency. This work aims to investigate a strategy for an optimal control allocation during path-following of prescribed ground trajectories. While the most obvious contributor to the optimizing cost function is energy efficiency, other aspects need to be considered such as the thermal behavior of the electric motors, the availability of energy storage systems resulting in a certain possible amount of regenerative braking, and other technical and normative constraints. Preliminary simulations of trajectory tracking based on the presented concept are shown.","","9780768082463","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505114.pdf&bkn=8504905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Amongst the proposed aircraft taxiing methods, the electric wheel-drive concept has received the most media attention. As part of ongoing research and development into the More Electric Aircraft (MEA), a study has been conducted to examine the technical feasibility of an electric wheel-drive taxiing system using publicly available aircraft and runway coefficient data. The study shows the potential for overall mission fuel burn reductions, particularly for short haul aircraft with a relatively long taxi time. The study also highlights that the wheel-drive system needs to be considered as an integral part of the design of the next generation of MEA as it has implications for other systems on board the aircraft, particularly the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)required to power the wheel-drive system.","","9780768082463","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505510.pdf&bkn=8504905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The project demonstrates the lightweighting potential of a five passenger sedan, while maintaining vehicle performance and occupant safety. Prototype vehicles were manufactured and limited full vehicle testing was conducted. The Mach-I vehicle design, comprised of commercially available materials and production processes, achieved a 364kg (23.5%) full vehicle mass reduction, enabling the application of a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine resulting in a significant environmental benefit and fuel reduction.Ford Motor Company worked with material supplier, BASF Corporation, plus Montaplast GmbH, Hexion Inc., and WGS Global Services LC to design and develop the carbon fiber composite Front Cover, Oil Pan and Cam Carrier based off the production Ford 1.0L I3 EcoBoost engine. The reduced mass Front Cover and Oil Pan were both structurally strong enough to support the engine mount attachment and to meet all the powertrain bending stress targets present in the production engine. The final parts achieved a significant weight reduction of 24% for the Front Cover and 33% for the Oil Pan.The Cam Carrier uses a carbon fiber composite material with an innovative split cylinder head design that allows the upper cylinder head section referred to as the cam carrier to support the camshafts and valvetrain components independently from the lower section of the cylinder head. The splitting of the cylinder head facilitates the use of two different materials that meet the functional design requirements. The upper section or the cam carrier provides a 15% mass reduction and the lower section of the cylinder head is cast from aluminum material that will support the high peak cylinder pressures that occur in a GTDI engine.","","9780768082241","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504532.pdf&bkn=8504408&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Prototype vehicles were manufactured and limited full-vehicle testing was conducted. The Mach-I vehicle design, comprised of commercially-available materials and production processes, achieved a 364 kg (23.5%) full-vehicle mass reduction. This resulted in environmental benefits and fuel economy improvements.A significant factor in the overall MMLV mass reduction was the decrease in the powertrain system weight from 340 kg (conventional) to 267 kg (MMLV). This enabled the application of a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine as the main power plant. By downsizing the engine, and by implementing material changes within the engine, the weight of the dressed engine was lowered by 29 kg.This paper examines the results from studies performed on two key MMLV powertrain components: an aluminum engine block with steel bulkhead inserts; and a connecting rod forged using a high-strength aluminum alloy. Both can yield significant weight savings compared to their conventional iron and steel equivalent components.For the MMLV, a small-displacement, high-output engine was desired for the powertrain. Based upon a prototype1.0L I3, the MMLV variant was cast in aluminum instead of gray iron. As the aluminum block structure was not sufficient to carry the loads associated with operation, reinforcement was needed. A bulkhead insert (patent-pending) was designed to carry the loads from the head deck through to the crankshaft area while maintaining stable thermal growth characteristics in the main crank journal. The optimum geometry of the insert was found to have an I-beam cross-section; macro-serrations were added to enhance the bond between the block and bulkhead insert.This study found that the cast aluminum block with the bulkhead inserts reduced the weight of the I3 block by 9.5 kg; this represents a 42% savings compared to a block cast in iron. The study also determined that bulkhead inserts can be designed to carry 95% of the main bearing loads generated from the combustion process. Additionally, the casting process allowed for a high interfacial bond to develop between the block and insert. Finally, a bulkhead fatigue bench test was used to validate the design and accurately predict failure location in the bulkhead insert.The results of the study have been used to guide a decision to continue the evaluation of the aluminum block with bulkhead inserts.The aluminum connecting rod study found that, with a careful selection of material and processes, it is feasible to produce aluminum connecting rods for high volume OEM vehicles. Further, the study found that a recently developed high-temperature, high strain-rate forging process does improve the ductility and fatigue strength of a 2618-T6 aluminum alloy.CAE analysis was used to confirm that a connecting rod can be designed using the 2618-T6 alloy to meet fatigue safety factor as well as clamp load and fastener requirements. The analysis determined that the Al alloy reduced the weight of a connecting rod by over 200 g (for a total saving of 700 g for the I3 engine); this represents a weight savings of 40% compared to conventional steel alloy rods.As with the block, the initial study on the aluminum connecting rod indicates that further material, design, and component verification is warranted.","","9780768082241","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504571.pdf&bkn=8504408&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Pilla",NA; Clemson University,"Biocomposites in Automotive Applications","","2015","","","45","52","This paper focuses on the energy absorbing characteristics and progressive deformation behavior of woven jute-polyester composite cylindrical tubes subjected to an axial impact load. In this study, the impact energy absorption characteristics and crushing mechanisms of composite tubes of different thicknesses and number of plies are investigated. To start with, coupon specimens are made from laminates of jute and glass fiber-based polyester composites. These are then tested in a UTM for mechanical characterization of the composites under tensile and compressive loading conditions. Experiments are then conducted in a drop-weight impact testing device to investigate crash performance characteristics such as mean crush load, absorbed energy and specific energy absorption (SEA) of woven jute-polyester composite cylindrical tubes. Resulting progressive failure modes and crush characteristics of the jute-polyester composite tubes are presented and compared with woven roving mat (WRM) glass fiber polyester composite tubes. It is observed that jute-polyester composite tubes can be of comparable structural performance as glass fiber-polyester composite tubes. The progressive failure mode of jute fiber mat tubes is, however, quite different than the splitting of plies observed for WRM glass fiber tubes. In addition to studying cylindrical tubes, 4- ply jute-polyester tubes of square cross-section are also considered and compared with 4-ply jute-polyester tubes of circular cross-section. The aim of the current research is to demonstrate the potential of natural fibers as replacement for synthetic fibers for more environmentally friendly energy-absorption countermeasures for vehicles.","","9780768082432","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504642.pdf&bkn=8504391&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The multi material components were assembled using structural adhesive bonding (hem and structure), self-pierce rivets (SPRs), single sided rivets, and bolts. The aluminum extrusion and the magnesium casting in the MMLV door were specifically designed to maximize stiffness, reduce part count and maximize mass reduction.To optimize the strength and weight of the MMLV door, a new aluminum intensive structure was developed. The new structure features a unique architecture that uses a multi-cavity aluminum extrusion joined to stamped sheet reinforcements to provide a direct load path between the hinges and the latch. The new structure also utilizes a high pressure vacuum die cast magnesium casting to create the structure at the base of the A-pillar on the front door to achieve the required structural stiffness while reducing components and maximizing the mass reduction. The “barn door” architecture of the inner structure of the door allowed for gage optimization of both the inner and outer stampings, the two largest and heaviest components of the assembly.Overall, the design architecture used in the MMLV doors allowed for a mass reduction of 33% through the use of multi material, gage optimization, and multiple forming technologies, while achieving all of the structural requirements.","","9780768082241","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504414.pdf&bkn=8504408&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The addition of coir fiber (treated and untreated) reduced cell size and increased cell density. Further decrease in cell size and increase in cell density were observed for treated fibers compared with PHBV/untreated fiber composites. Mechanical properties such as specific toughness and strain-at-break improved for both solid and microcellular specimens with the addition of coir fibers (both treated and untreated); however, the specific modulus remained essentially the same statistically while the specific strength decreased slightly. The silane-treated coir fiber composites showed the greatest improvement in specific toughness and strain-at-break among the treated fiber composites.

Pilla",NA; Clemson University,"Biocomposites in Automotive Applications","","2015","","","109","129","The environmental issues confronting the automotive industry are legion at a time when the industry has not been in the best position to respond. Concerns have been raised that the industry needs to be producing “green mobility products” without definition, specificity, or expression of customer need. Business infrastructure and the regulatory landscapes are uncertain, but likely to be restrictive for the automotive sector, especially with regard to the environment and green issues. Actions the automotive industry could consider include: develop a common dictionary of terms related to “green mobility products”; address the issues affecting the industry before regulations are imposed; make the Mobility Sector part of the solution; focus on being environmentally responsive, cost-saving, and time-sensitive; and assure that the Mobility Sector is recognized as a leader for new, green technology.Following an SAE workshop that addressed these issues and was supported by the State of Michigan and the Michigan Green Chemistry Roundtable, SAE's Motor Vehicle Council established the Green Technology Systems Group (GTSG) to serve as a guiding body for consensus standards development for environmental sustainability issues in the automotive sector.GTSG has reviewed existing standards and begun to explore new standards that need to be created for the automotive industry. Four Task Forces have been established:• Vehicle Materials, focusing on biobased materials;• Implementing Principles for Green Chemistry and Engineering;• Automotive Green Technology Case Studies; and• Terminology and Definitions for Automotive Green Technologies.Collaboration with other SAE Committees has been initiated so as to leverage expertise and knowledge. A report on the workshop that initiated these activities and a status report on current GSTG activities and projects will be presented.","","9780768082432","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504862.pdf&bkn=8504391&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The objectives are to diminish i) the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being released from the brake materials when subjected to temperatures higher than 300 °C; and ii) release the potentially hazardous wear debris particles to the environment. Brake materials were fabricated in university and tested using SAE J2430 test procedure and full scale automotive brake dynamometer (Dyno). Dyno test results indicate that the average friction level of the eco-friendly Cu-free materials (μ ∼ 0.30 to 0.33) was only slightly lower when compared to the baseline material containing Cu (μ ∼ 0.35). All tested materials have passed the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP). The Dyno results show that all tested materials were resistant to thermal fade and the friction level slightly increased with the increased speed in the second effectiveness test. However, the wear rate of the Cu-free materials, as well as the corresponding disc wear, was higher than the wear of Cu-containing baseline material. A thorough SEM/EDX and XRD analyses revealed that the detected friction and wear performance can be ascribed to developed friction layer on surfaces of pad and disc.","","9780768082432","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504442.pdf&bkn=8504391&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

In addition, a chemical additive to polymer matrix is another direction to improve the performance. In this study, several types of natural fibers were chosen, including European flax fiber, North American flax, and North American hemp fiber.

This was with a view to exploiting the characteristics of PKS, which are otherwise largely deposited as waste from palm oil production, to make substitution for asbestos which has been found to be carcinogenic. Two sets of brake pads with identical ingredients but using either PKS or asbestos as base material were produced, following standard procedures employed by a commercial brake pad manufacturer. The physical, thermal, mechanical and the wear characteristics of the PKS-based brake pads were evaluated, compared with the values for the asbestos-based brake pads, and weighted against established recommendations for friction materials for road vehicle brake pads. The PKS based brake pad was characterized by 32.34 Brinell hardness number; 0.62%, swell and growth; 3375 N/s, bonding to back plate, and phase change at 689.5°C. The coefficient of friction of the experimental brake pad on cast iron was 0.43, while wear rate was 9.17 E-5 g/min and exhibiting a third order polynomial with run-in time. The properties of the PKS-based brake pad wholly satisfied the NIS 323 standard. The PKS is therefore suitable for use as friction material in automotive brake-pads. Current investigation is on field testing and reformulation of the composite for enhanced performance.","","9780768082432","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504741.pdf&bkn=8504391&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"A Study on Impact Perforation Resistance of Jute-Polyester Composite Laminates (2014-01-1055)","C. Lu; S. Pilla",NA; Clemson University,"Biocomposites in Automotive Applications","","2015","","","37","44","Natural fiber-based composites such as jute-polyester composites have the potential to be more cost-effective and environment-friendly substitutes for glass fiber-reinforced composites which are commonly found in many applications. In an earlier study (Mache and Deb [1]), jute-polyester composite tubes of circular and square cross-sections were shown to perform competitively under axial impact loading conditions when compared to similar components made of bidirectional E-glass fiber mats and thermo-setting polyester resin. For jute-reinforced plastic panels to be feasible solutions for automotive interior trim panels, laminates made of such materials should have adequate perforation resistance. In the current study, a systematic characterization of jute-polyester and glass-polyester composite laminates made by compression molding is at first carried out under quasi-static tensile, compressive and flexural loading conditions. Low velocity impact perforation tests at speeds of around 4 m/s are then performed in an instrumented drop-weight testing device on square plates extracted from the same laminates. The energy absorbed in each of these tests is estimated using a novel approach based on load cell data and velocity-time history measured with a high speed camera. A new parameter is identified which is used for comparing the intrinsic resistance of jute and glass composites under impact indentation conditions. In terms of gross energy absorption capacity, the current investigation shows that jute-polyester laminates which are of lower density than glass-polyester laminates can be made comparable to the latter with an increased number of plies (i.e. laminate thickness).","","9780768082432","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504504.pdf&bkn=8504391&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Considerations on the Use of Hydrophobic, Superhydrophobic or Icephobic Coatings as a Part of the Aircraft Ice Protection System (2013-01-2108)","R. Flemming",NA,"Ice Accretion and Icing Technology","","2015","","","13","23","Ice adhesion on critical aircraft surfaces is a serious potential hazard that runs the risk of causing accidents. For this reason aircraft are equipped with active ice protection systems (AIPS). AIPS increase fuel consumption and add complexity to the aircraft systems. Reducing energy consumption of the AIPS or replacing the AIPS by a Passive Ice Protection System (PIPS), could significantly reduce aircraft fuel consumption. New coatings with superhydrophobic properties have been developed to reduce water adherence to surfaces. Superhydrophobic coatings can also reduce ice adhesion on surfaces and are used as icephobic coatings.The question is whether superhydrophobic or icephobic coatings would be able to reduce the cost associated with AIPS. To address this concern, this paper reviews the current knowledge on superhydrophobic and icephobic coatings, proposes a parameter to quantify the coating hydrophobicity level and presents methods to adapt available experimental data to aircraft applications.A second important question is whether the durability of superhydrophobic coatings is adequate for aircraft applications. Most of the available coatings that can reduce AIPS power consumption show poor erosion resistance and therefore have no practical use. To help coating manufacturers develop coatings adapted to aircraft applications, aircraft erosion test guidelines are presented.Experiments have demonstrated that superhydrophobic coatings can significantly reduce AIPS power consumption; the savings depend on the hydrophobicity level of the coating. However, erosion resistance is the biggest challenge for manufacturers and designers of coatings. Superhydrophobic and icephobic coatings need to be developed to satisfy erosion requirements. Ice phobic coatings performance needs to be improved as well.","","9780768081893","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504326.pdf&bkn=8504291&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Oscillating Airfoil Icing Tests in the NASA Glenn Research Center Icing Research Tunnel (2011-38-0016)","R. Flemming",NA,"Ice Accretion and Icing Technology","","2015","","","85","94","A team from the USA rotorcraft industry, NASA, and academia was established to create a validated high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) icing tool for rotorcraft. Previous work showed that an oscillating blade with a periodic variation in angle of attack causes changes in the accreted ice shape and this makes a significant change in the airfoil drag. Although there is extensive data for ice accumulation on a stationary airfoil section, high-quality icing-tunnel data on an oscillating airfoil is scarce for validating the rotorcraft icing problem. In response to this need, a two-dimensional (2D) oscillating airfoil icing test was recently performed in the Icing Research Tunnel at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Three leading-edge specimens for an existing 15-inch chord test apparatus were designed and instrumented to provide the necessary data for the CFD code validation. The test apparatus was run in steady and oscillatory operation mode to collect data for variations in liquid water content, tunnel temperature, and airspeed. Data obtained from the test include ice tracings, photographs, surface pressure measurements, wake traverse data, and force balance data. This paper presents an overview of the test including model details, test instrumentation, sample results, and a summary of key findings.","","9780768081893","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504528.pdf&bkn=8504291&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"S-76D™ Tail Rotor Ice Impact Test (2011-38-0101)","R. Flemming",NA,"Ice Accretion and Icing Technology","","2015","","","47","60","This paper presents the test method and results from ice impact testing conducted on representative S-76D™ Helicopter Tail Rotor (TR) blade and TR control system assemblies. Full scale ice impact tests on the leading edge of the tail rotor blade paddle, pitch links, and a pitch beam were conducted to demonstrate sufficient residual strength for continued safe operation following a potential ice strike. During testing the tail rotor system remained stationary with centrifugal force (CF) simulated by stiffening the tail rotor blade with spring loading at the bolted joint. The ice pieces were shot at the blade/control specimen at an equivalent forward velocity of ice shedding from an aircraft traveling at 155 knots (1.0 VNE; 261.61 ft/s) plus an equivalent forward velocity of the blade given the rotational velocity at the tip (670 ft/s @ 99.4% TR Nr). Additional shots were conducted to define the relationship between impact energy and projectile fracture mode. The TR blade orientation was approximately at 0° collective pitch at the bolted joint, which demonstrates the greatest potential damage configuration possible in current facility. Ice specimens impacted on the blade were incremented in size in order to establish a blade damage/ice shed size relationship. The S-76D Tail Rotor system demonstrated an ice impact resistance of up to and including 1.05 lb equivalent impact energy with no detectable structural damage. Inspections and posttest analysis have confirmed that the control system and the tail rotor blade can withstand the impact of a 1.05 lb ice projectile shed from an A/C travelling at VNE and sustain only minor, non-structural damage.","","9780768081893","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504503.pdf&bkn=8504291&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Numerical Correlation Between Meteorological Parameters and Aerodynamic Performance Degradation of Iced Airfoils (2013-01-2137)","R. Flemming",NA,"Ice Accretion and Icing Technology","","2015","","","61","73","A numerical analysis is conducted to investigate the performance degradation of iced airfoils in terms of meteorological parameters. Reference ice accretion shapes are taken from NASA's icing wind tunnel test results. Ice accretion shape and aerodynamic performance of the airfoil are numerically calculated under the same conditions as those used in the tests, and response surface equations are generated based on the results. The response surface models are applied to the conditions specified in Federal Aviation Regulations, appendix C of part 25, and the changes in aerodynamic coefficients are investigated. The areas of most significant lift and drag performance degradation overlap. The lift coefficient plunges more than 50% under temperatures greater than −10°C and LWC greater than 2g/m3. Under the same conditions, the drag performance greatly decreases as well. On the other hand, the moment coefficient greatly decreases under temperatures of less than −40°C and greater MVD. Changes in free stream speed yield little effect on moment performance compared to lift and drag. Within the bounds specified in the present study, the effects of exposure time are insignificant.","","9780768081893","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504723.pdf&bkn=8504291&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"In-Flight Icing of UAVs - The Influence of Reynolds Number on the Ice Accretion Process (2011-01-2572)","R. Flemming",NA,"Ice Accretion and Icing Technology","","2015","","","95","106","The intensive deployment of UAVs for surveillance and reconnaissance missions during the last couple of decades has revealed their vulnerability to icing conditions. At present, a common icing avoidance strategy is simply not to fly when icing is forecast. Consequently, UAV missions in cold seasons and cold regions can be delayed for days when icing conditions persist. While this approach limits substantially the failure of UAV missions as a result of icing, there is obviously a need to develop all-weather capabilities. A key step in accomplishing this objective is to understand better the influence of a smaller geometry and a lower speed on the ice accretion process, relative to the extensively researched area of in-flight icing for traditional aircraft configurations characterized by high Reynolds number.Our analysis of the influence of Reynolds number on the ice accretion process is performed for the NACA0012 airfoil. Analytical analysis of the integrated mass and energy balance equations along the airfoil surface allows the identification of regimes of rime and glaze formation, as well as the ice accretion extent as a function of static air temperature and liquid water content. For each Reynolds number, a CFD solver computes the airflow field, and the distributions of Stanton number and static air pressure along the airfoil surface. Next, a drop trajectory solver computes the distribution of collection efficiency along the airfoil for a given drop size. Finally, a morphogenetic model is used to predict the ice accretion shape and its extent over the entire Reynolds number range under consideration. Our analysis highlights the differences between ice accretions on components of traditional aircraft and UAVs, arising from their differences in cruising speed and airfoil dimensions.","","9780768081893","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504405.pdf&bkn=8504291&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

A stationary icing as well as an icing of a moving droplet gives us great insights into the development of an ice-prevention system for engineering purpose. For academic purpose, it gives experimental findings in a two-phase flow. To understand the icing process, we applied a luminescent imaging technique. It uses a temperature-sensitive luminophore and a temperature-insensitive luminophore to create the luminescent water. The luminescent outputs from these luminophores are simultaneously captured by a high-speed color camera. By simply taking a ratio, the temperature distribution can be extracted. In this paper, this imaging system is shown with its temperature characterization. An icing process of a stationary droplet is shown in this paper.

A subset of providing solutions for rotorcraft icing problems is predicting two-dimensional ice accumulation on rotor airfoils. While much has been done to predict ice for fixed-wing airfoil sections, the rotorcraft problem has two additional challenges: first, rotor airfoils tend to experience flows in higher Mach number regimes, often creating glaze ice which is harder to predict; second, rotor airfoils oscillate in pitch to produce balance across the rotor disk. A methodology and validation test cases are presented to solve the rotor airfoil problem as an important step to solving the larger rotorcraft icing problem. The process couples Navier-Stokes CFD analysis with the ice accretion analysis code, LEWICE3D.

Flemming",NA,"Ice Accretion and Icing Technology","","2015","","","1","5","One of the relevant applications of this study is related to designing anti-icing surfaces. Supercooled water droplet impact at high Weber number on a wing of airplane is one of the main concerns in aircraft ice accumulation. In order to address this issue, an experimental setup which generates co-flow is designed to mimic the real scenario of droplet impact in practical icing condition. This process is observed using a high-speed camera to capture the correct moment of sliding at 10000 frames per second and 120000 1/s shutter speed. Different air stream velocities are generated by a convergent nozzle with a maximum Mach number of 0.1. Two different cases are considered. First, droplet impact in still air with an impact velocity of 2 m/s is performed as the base case. Then droplet impact accompanied with 10, 18 and 20 m/s air stream velocities having the same impact velocity are conducted. Droplet impact velocity will change either by air flow or gravity. So, it means that an increase in air speed must be accompanied with a decrease in needle height to substrate. It is clearly demonstrated that for Weber number around 140 (e.g. impact velocity equal to 2.1 m/s and droplet size equal to 2.3 mm) in still air there is no droplet break up either in spreading or in receding stages. On the other hand, violent splashing of water droplet impacting with the same Weber number accompanied with 18 and 20 m/s airstream velocities were observed during the recoiling stage.","","9780768081893","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504524.pdf&bkn=8504291&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The test vehicle was a Ford F-250 Light Truck with a 7.5L V-8 engine. The vehicle was tested in a dynamometer cell equipped with cell blowers to simulate road speed conditions.It was found that diverting the outlet air from the radiator will reduce underhood component temperatures when the vehicle is in motion and also at normal idle. However, if the vehicle is to be used for power takeoff applications requiring a ""kicked"" idle, then forced cooling of the exhaust manifolds is also required to maintain reduced underhood temperatures. A combination of these two techniques maximized the reduction of underhood temperatures for all operating conditions tested. These observations are of course specific to this vehicle powertrain configuration and its duty cycle.

These development efforts have typically focused on improving steady state operation, but recently there has been increased interest on the improvement potential during dynamic behavior. In particular the warm-up behavior of combustion engines is a field of increasing investigation. This warm-up behavior is especially pertinent in Europe, where customers tend to drive shorter distances, and the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) reflects this driving pattern. The desire to influence this warm-up behavior is typically referred to as thermal management.Thermal management may be considered as “heat brokering” where the optimum flow of heat is to be decided, e.g. take heat from exhaust or coolant and feed it to coolant or oil. The goal is to reduce fuel consumption by achieving the most efficient warm-up of the powertrain. This paper will review the results of systematic testing and optimization of thermal management on small four cylinder engines. It will also review the potential for fuel consumption reduction through the use of heat storage devices.","","9780768081848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504352.pdf&bkn=8504285&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Cold Start Thermal Management with Electrically Heated Catalyst: A Way to Lower Fuel Consumption","T. Obidi",NA,"Thermal Management in Automotive Applications","","2015","","","63","70","Recent engine development has been mainly driven by increased specific volumetric power and especially by fuel consumption minimization. On the other hand the stringent emission limits require a very fast cold start that can be reached only using tailored catalyst heating strategy.This kind of thermal management is widely used by engine manufactures although it leads to increased fuel consumption. This fuel penalty is usually higher for high power output engines that have a very low load during emission certification cycle leading to very low exhaust gas temperature and, consequently, the need of additional energy to increase the exhaust gas temperature is high.An alternative way to reach a fast light off minimizing fuel consumption increase is the use of an Electrical Heated Catalyst (EHC) that uses mechanical energy from the engine to generate the electrical energy to heat up the catalyst. Following this thermal management strategy the energy input can be tailored according to the component need and the energy loss in the system can be minimized. Moreover, the efficiency of such systems can be further optimized using for example brake energy recuperation or advanced thermal management.The present work describes the different engine management strategies tested by Ferrari to find the best compromise between fuel consumption and emission reduction.","","9780768081848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8506659.pdf&bkn=8504285&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"About the Editor","T. Obidi",NA,"Thermal Management in Automotive Applications","","2015","","","99","99","With new and more stringent standards addressing emission reduction and fuel economy, the importance of a well-developed engine thermal management system becomes even greater. With about 30% of the fuel intake energy dissipated through the cooling system and another 30% through the exhaust system, it is to be expected that serious research has been dedicated to this field. Thermal Management in Automotive Applications, edited by Dr. T. Yomi Obidi, brings together a focused collection of SAE technical papers on the subject. It offers insights into how thermal management impacts the efficiency of engines in heavy vehicles, the effects of better coolant flow control, and the use of smart thermostat and next-generation cooling pumps. It also provides an in-depth analysis of the possible gains in optimum warm-up sequence and thermal management on a small gasoline engine. With continuously increasing gadgetry in modern vehicles, the average temperature in the engine compartment has seen significant increase. It is important to be able to divert the heat away from passengers as well as from some components that may be negatively impacted by excessive temperatures. Thermal Management in Automotive Applications points out solutions to this challenge, including material and design options.","","9780768081848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504845.pdf&bkn=8504285&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

We have developed methods for producing both oxide and metal nanofluids, studied their thermal conductivity, and obtained promising results: (1) Stable suspensions of nanoparticles can be achieved. (2) Nanofluids have significantly higher thermal conductivities than their base liquids. (3) Measured thermal conductivities of nanofluids are much greater than predicted. For these reasons, nanofluids show promise for improving the design and performance of vehicle thermal management systems. However, critical barriers to further development and application of nanofluid technology are agglomeration of nanoparticles and oxidation of metallic nanoparticles. Therefore, methods to prevent particle agglomeration and degradation are required.","","9780768081848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504500.pdf&bkn=8504285&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Coolant Flow Control Strategies for Automotive Thermal Management Systems","T. Obidi",NA,"Thermal Management in Automotive Applications","","2015","","","21","33","The automotive thermal management system is responsible for maintaining engine and passenger compartment temperatures, which promote normal combustion events and passenger comfort. This system traditionally circulates a water ethylene glycol mixture through the engine block using a belt-driven water pump, wax pellet thermostat valve, radiator with electric fan, and heater core. Although vehicle cooling system performance has been reliable and acceptable for many decades, advances in mechatronics have permitted upgrades to powertrain and chassis components. In a similar spirit, the introduction of a variable speed electric water pump and servo-motor thermostat valve allows ECU-based thermal control. This paper examines the integration of an electric water pump and intelligent thermostat valve to satisfy the engine's basic cooling requirements, minimize combustion chamber fluctuations due to engine speed changes, and permit quick heating of a cold block. A controller architecture is introduced to regulate the operation of these two components. A series of mathematical models are presented to describe the dc servo-motor actuated thermostat valve, electric water pump, and thermal behavior of in-cylinder engine components. The multiple node resistor-capacitor engine model estimates the thermal behavior of the cylinder wall and cylinder head for use in the model-based control algorithm. Representative results are presented and discussed to investigate the performance of the proposed control strategy in regulating the thermal management system for various operating speeds.","","9780768081848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504844.pdf&bkn=8504285&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The supply community is also increasingly playing a more significant role in helping the original equipment manufacturers research, develop, and introduce the latest engineering innovations that help bring competitive advantage for their automaker partners. Each year, the editors of SAE’s Automotive Engineering magazine publish many articles focused on the technology and engineering innovations of new passenger and concept vehicles, and these articles have been collected into this volume. This 2015 Passenger Car and 2014 Concept Car Yearbook is the fourth in an ongoing series of books that provide yearly snapshots of the latest and greatest technologies introduced by the automotive industry. In this book, we explore from an OEM and supplier perspective the newest and most technically interesting production vehicles released for the 2015 model year. In addition, we also have included a technology-focused recap of the concept cars revealed during 2014. Readers will have, in one publication, a complete overview of the key advances that took place over the course of the year from around the world. Each new model is profiled in its own chapter with one or more articles by the award-winning editors and contributors of Automotive Engineering in this exclusive compilation of print and online content. The novel engineering aspects of each new vehicle are explored, with exclusive interviews of key engineers and product developers providing insights you can only get from you can only get from Automotive Engineering. This book is published for the most technically-minded enthusiasts who are interested in new car technologies, as well as practicing automotive engineers who are interested in new engineering trends. Engineering trends explored focus on what engineers are doing to meet the sometimes conflicting consumer and governmental demands for improved vehicle fuel efficiency, performance, safety and comfort. In short, this book: • Provides a single source for information on the key engineering trends of the year from both automaker and supplier perspectives. • Allows the reader to skip to chapters that cover specific car models that interest them, or read about all models from beginning to end. • Makes for dynamic book reading, with its large number of big, full-color images and easy-reading magazine format.","","9780768081633","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504685.pdf&bkn=8504274&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Design and Failure Analysis of Composites: Static Loading","S. Pilla",Clemson University,"CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites","","2015","","","11","11","Composites are now extensively used in applications where outstanding mechanical properties are necessary in combination with weight savings, due to their highly tunable microstructure and mechanical properties. These properties present great potential for part integration, which results in lower manufacturing costs and faster time to market. Composites also have a high level of styling flexibility in terms of deep drawn panel, which goes beyond what can be achieved with metal stampings. The so-called multifunctional or smart composites provide significant benefits to the vehicles as compared to the traditional materials that only have monotonic properties. CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites focuses on the latest use of CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) methods in design and failure analysis of composite materials and structures, beginning with a brief introduction to the design and failure analysis of composite materials, and then presenting some recent, innovative CAE design examples of composite structures by engineers from major CAE developers and automobile OEMs and suppliers.

Pilla",Clemson University,"CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites","","2015","","","35","44","The use of composite materials is very important in automotive field to meet the European emission and consumption standards set for 2020. The most important challenge is to apply composite materials in structural applications not only in racing vehicles or supercars, but also in mass-production vehicles. In this paper is presented a real case study, that is the suspension wishbone arm (with convergence tie and pull-rod system) of the XAM 2.0 urban vehicle prototype, that it has the particular characteristics that of the front and rear, and left and right suspension system has the same geometry. The starting point has been an existing solution made in aluminum to manufacture a composite one.The first step was the development of a dynamic model of the vehicle to understand the suspension loads and to define the suspension weight and stiffness target with respect to the solution made on aluminum, because it was necessary to understand the tensile strain on the component to simplify and optimize the geometry. Once the wishbones external surfaces have been defined, a composite layer thickness and orientation optimization have been made to define the lamination lay-out. After the analysis of the composite thickness optimization results, a new CAD model, that encounters the process constrains, was build up and finally the lamination process was defined.The results were a weight reduction of 9% and an implementation of stiffness of 38%.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504550.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Pilla",Clemson University,"CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites","","2015","","","19","28","Materials used in automotive components play a key role in providing crash safety to passengers and pedestrians. DuPont's lightweight hybrid material technology, which combines injection molded fiber reinforced plastics with drape molded woven composite materials, provides safety engineers with stiff energy absorbing alternatives. In an effort to validate the hybrid material's crash performance while avoiding expensive crash testing, numerical tools and methodologies are applied in evaluation of a hybrid composite test beam. Multi-scale material models capturing nonlinear strain-rate dependency, anisotropic characteristics, and failure criteria are calibrated on a fiber reinforced plastic and a woven fabric. The fiber orientation and warp/weft angles were extracted from injection and drape molding simulation.The material laws and orientation information are coupled in a single finite element analysis to predict the performance of the hybrid composite beam under a dynamic three point bending load. Stiffness and strength comparisons between numerical and test results are carried out to validate the finite element modeling methodology and tools used.

"Significance of Virtual Prototyping in Design of Composite Structures for Automobiles","S. Pilla",Clemson University,"CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites","","2015","","","29","34","New regulations such as CAFE are pushing OEMs to look for options to increase vehicle mileage. Increasing combustion efficiency, alternate fuels and weight reductions are front runners in this quest. Due to limited scope of improvement in first two options, weight reduction is considered as more feasible option. Composite materials have long been used in Aerospace-aviation industries for weight reduction. So, usage of composite materials is gaining popularity in automotive industry also. Composite manufacturing is still an expensive and time consuming procedure, so virtual prototyping is being used to evaluate design, very early in the product cycle, to reduce physical prototype testing. In this paper we have tried to demonstrate how designers can easily analyze automotive components using virtual prototyping. Starting from CAD, general workflow of composite structure modeling to optimization is discussed. Structural simulation results for composite Door are presented and are also compared with the same component made up of traditional materials.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504876.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

A given shell structure of an automotive BIW is affected by two load cases, which are calculated separately so the particular needs in the BIW from each load case can be easily identified. The BIW is composed of a proposed composite cabin and a metal alloy motor and rear compartment, providing in this way a very reliable, affordable and light structure. An introductory test with Topological optimization is performed to the full body structure, in order to assess where the main stress concentrations are. All of this during normal driving and a single crash situation. Topometric and Sizing optimization is used for the thickness and fiber angle in the composite Cabin structure. Road loads applied to the frontal and rear strut towers are taken as load cases. The angle and thickness optimization halves the minimum mass required to fulfill the constraints, in comparison with just thickness optimization.Finally a Topometric and Topographic optimization for thickness and shape for the front midrails under a frontal crash situation is performed. This part undergoes a dynamic impact as a load case. The front part of the BIW is separated from the rest of vehicle and ESL (Equivalent static loads) are applied. This is performed with the joint process of DS Genesis and LS-DYNA. The optimized form of the midrails obtained is much lighter and stronger than the original, maintaining appropriate size and dimensions in the original packaging configuration.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504527.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

This project presented a preliminary technique for each category. In composite design concept, small-angle lamination was preferred due to its high delamination resistance to debris impact. In computer simulation, an exponential blast model which matched with real blasts is imposed into LS-DYNA and satisfactory results were obtained. In blast testing, an innovative testing facility based on a shock tube was established and fiber fracture was found to be the primary damage mode in the composite laminates subjected to blast loading. This project presented a preliminary solution for tackling the concerned issue on composite laminates used for resisting blast loading.

Pilla",Clemson University,"CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites","","2015","","","91","106","This paper investigates the crashworthiness of structural composite components in frontal and side crash tests. In addition, the safety benefits of composites applications in future lighter vehicles are studied. The methodology of the research includes two steps: (1) developing a light-weight vehicle based on a current finite element (FE) vehicle using advanced plastics and composites, and (2) evaluating the crashworthiness of the light-weighted vehicle by frontal and side New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) test simulations. An FE model of a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado, which is a bodyon- frame pickup truck, was selected as the baseline vehicle for light-weighting.By light-weighting components in the Silverado, the vehicle weight was reduced 19%. As a result, the content of plastics and composite in the light-weighted vehicle was 23.6% of the total weight of the light-weight vehicle. Light-weighted composite structural components include bumpers, front-end module, fenders, pillar reinforcements, door beams, and ladder frame. Frontal and side NCAP test simulations of the lightweighted vehicle show that the light-weighted vehicles using advanced plastics and composites provide equivalent structural performance to the baseline vehicle in the full-scale impact condition. Also, this study demonstrates that using plastics and composites can reduce the vehicle weight efficiently.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504557.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Crash Modeling of High-Pressure Wet Wound Composite Vessels","S. Pilla",Clemson University,"CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites","","2015","","","75","90","Limitations of fossil fuels and concerns surrounding global warming favor the introduction of new powertrain concepts with higher efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel cell vehicles offer the highest potential for sustainable mobility in the future. One major component of fuel cell vehicles is the hydrogen storage system. The most-used approach is to store hydrogen in carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) vessels manufactured by a filament winding process with an operating pressure up to 70 MPa (hereafter referred as H2 vessel). Accurate and reliable failure prediction of such thick composite structures with numerical methods in case of impact events is important.The objective of this paper is the evaluation of the commercial fiber reinforced plastics material model MAT162 in LS-DYNA [1] to describe both the onset and the progression of damage of the H2 vessel. MAT162 has the capability of modeling progressive damage of composites. It is based on Hashin's quadratic failure criteria [2] and Matzenmiller's progressive damage model in terms of damage variables [3], and it is able to discern various composite failure modes.Based on the introduced comprehensive equation set of MAT162 a consistent set of test procedures and the associated composite specimens are defined to quantify the material properties which are needed for solving the equations. The properties quantify the non-isotropic stressstrain relationship, the non-isotropic strength as well as continuum damage theory related values. The test procedures cover ASTM standardized tests as well as non-standardized tests. The material properties are either directly measured or quantified by calibration simulations using MAT162.Finally, a quasi-static punch test using the cylindrical part of the vessel with a representative fiber layup and a comparable composite thickness derived from a real hydrogen storage vessel is reported in terms of strain, displacement, load, and damage propagation to validate the MAT162 FE crash model.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504492.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The importance of reinforced composites will grow in this area. While the structural behavior and the simulation up to high strain-rate processes for those materials have been in the focus of investigation for many years, nowadays the simulation of high cycle fatigue behavior is getting important as well.Efficient fatigue analysis for metals was developed by understanding the microscopic behavior (crack nucleation and initiation) and bringing it to the macroscopic level by combining it with the matching test data (SN curves etc.). Similar approaches can be applied to composite materials as well.The paper gives a comprehensive review of fatigue simulation of fiber reinforced composite, based on the authors' experience in this field for different types of composites like random fiber reinforced to textile reinforcements, from detailed micro-structure analysis to efficient multi-scale algorithms, and from structural applications to detailed fatigue analysis.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504463.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Virtual Coupon Testing of Carbon Fiber Composites for Application in Structural Analysis","S. Pilla",Clemson University,"CAE Design and Failure Analysis of Automotive Composites","","2015","","","13","18","In the steady quest for lightweighting solutions, continuous carbon fiber composites are becoming more approachable for design, now not only used in the aerospace but also the automotive industries. Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) are now being integrated into car body structures, used for their high stiffness and strength and low weight.The material properties of continuous carbon fiber composites are much more complex than metal, especially with respect to failure; this is further complicated by the fact that a single part is typically made from stacks of several unidirectional plies, each with a different fiber orientation. Hence failure occurs because of various mechanisms taking place at the ply level (matrix cracking, fiber breakage, fiber-matrix debonding) or between the plies (delamination). These mechanisms remain not fully understood and are investigated through experimental and virtual testing.To predict composite failure, we have developed advanced simulation strategies combining finite element analysis (FEA) and nonlinear micromechanical material modeling. In particular, we implemented progressive failure models such as Matzenmiller-Lubliner-Taylor to maintain the validity of the analysis after the first elements have failed. In addition, we enriched these models with inputs computed at the microscopic scale.Multi-scale modeling decomposes the macroscopic mechanical state between fibers and resin, enables the definition of per-phase failure criteria and provides access to macroscopic or microscopic stiffness degradation. In this paper, we will show how micro-mechanically-based progressive failure models enable virtual coupon testing for application in structural analysis.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504432.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The strategy is based on the building block approach, in which the knowledge on the composite material and structure is built step by step from the coupon level up to the final full scale structure. Damage is then discussed, as it can't be ignored when composites are concerned. The approach available in the SAMCEF finite element code is then described. It is based on the continuum mechanics approach, and allows studying the progressive failure of composites in the plies and at their interface (so considering delamination). The material models are described, and their use is illustrated at the coupon level. The identification procedure for this damage models is also discussed. It is therefore shown how this information of the material behavior can be used at the upper stages of the building block approach and so applied to larger scale structures. It is advocated here that this approach can be used for the automotive applications, leading to a transfer of technology from aerospace to automotive.","","9780768081688","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504800.pdf&bkn=8503549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

In particular, the antiskid function needs very low latency and jitter, and full deterministic transmission to operate nominally.Furthermore, actual research study on braking, landing gear and aircraft on ground control laws requires more and more real-time power and fast control loops to provide new functionalities and higher efficiency, and necessary to be considered in the design of these new platforms.The target is, thus, to reach more standardized and scalable avionics, dedicated to the highest critical aircraft functions as the braking control, and standard capable to facilitate the high critical system integration and to harmonize the development and test process, regarding the final common objective (at aircraft and system levels) to reduce the development time and cost, without compromising the trend of more efficient and powerful real time control laws with adaptive behaviour.","","9780768082494","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505342.pdf&bkn=8505034&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Predicting Landing Gear Carbon Brake Vibration and Performance via Subscale Test and Analysis (2005-01-3437)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Brakes and Tires","","2015","","","55","64","Variation of the coefficient of friction generated in aircraft landing gear brakes can cause vibration or performance problems that damage aircraft or make control of the brake difficult. A means of detecting and predicting the range of such variation is therefore useful during the design stage of a brake. Two causes of stochastic variation, and subscale test methods to characterize the range of variation are presented. A mathematical model is developed that employs the subscale test data to represent the statistical probability of variation in fullscale brake performance. This variability is otherwise difficult to predict or detect due to the improbability of occurrence. Measured flight test brake data is compared with model predictions for two different carbon brake specimens used in full-scale carbon brake designs, and the model is shown to correlate well. An examination of the correlation, and related flight test data indicate that excessive brake torque gain caused by water desorption transition can lead to severe brake performance and vibration problems. The model in this paper enables identification of candidate brake lining materials that have a propensity for these performance problems, and allow them to be eliminated in the brake design stage. Consideration of desorption, and its probability of occurrence, offers insights to improve subscale testing, dynamometer testing, and flight-testing.","","9780768082494","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505742.pdf&bkn=8505034&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"The Effect of Wear Groove on Vibration and Noise of Aircraft Brakes: Theoretical and Experimental Evidence (2008-01-2557)","R. Schmidt",NA,"Advances in Aircraft Brakes and Tires","","2015","","","95","101","The goal of this paper is to delineate recent experimental evidence that the presence of conforming surface wear groove tends to stabilize the vibration and noise response of aircraft brakes. This finding is consistent with an earlier theoretical study in which the contact between Carbon-Carbon (C/C) composite brake disks was assumed to be visco-elastic and through this assumption it was found that the existence of conforming grooves results in increasing dynamic stability of brake disk interaction. Therefore, the presumption of visco-elastic contact for C/C brakes seems to agree with the experimental observation in a subscale dynamometer.The present paper summarizes both theoretical analysis and the test results. In the tests C/C composites were heat treated for one hour at temperatures 1800°C and 2400°C, respectively. They were then subjected to frictional tests in a subscale aircraft brake dynamometer at 50 % relative humidity (RH) level. Coefficient of friction (µ), vibration and noise were recorded during simulated braking. The surface topography was determined after each sequence of friction tests. The nanohardness of fiber and matrix in bulk composite were measured using a nanoindenter. The hardness of fiber was found to be two times that of the matrix for the samples heat treated at 2400°C as compared to the samples heat treated at 1800°C. The surface roughness (sRa) was measured as 1.96 .m for the sample heat treated at 2400°C after the 100% simulated normal landing energy conditions. The sample heat treated at 1800°C exhibited smoother friction surface (sRa=0.86.µm). During braking, µ varied by a factor of 2 or more which led to undesirable vibration.Both the theoretical model and the tests results point to the same conclusion; existence of conforming grooves enhances dynamic stability of a disk pair, resulting in significant reduction in vibration and noise in braking.","","9780768082494","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505874.pdf&bkn=8505034&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The factors such as tire footprint ratio, vertical load, and inflation pressure are analyzed to determine their magnitude on the hydroplaning speed. The full-scale, spin-down, test data are used to derive the boundaries of the expected hydroplaning speed. The recommendations are made emphasizing the areas of concern for a safe aircraft operation. The use of the standardized test procedure is proposed to expand the existing full-scale aircraft test results database.","","9780768082494","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8506658.pdf&bkn=8505034&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The observer yields a highly accurate estimate of torque that is robust for the entire operating range of the brakes, and provides an input to a relatively simple control system that regulates applied torque from either an electro-hydraulic or electromechanical actuator. Excellent braking performance for a regional jet transport is demonstrated in this paper via hardware-in-the-loop simulation. A simple scheme for suppressing gear walk (aircraft application) is presented.","","9780768082494","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505115.pdf&bkn=8505034&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

We have identified our previously developed Robot Centric paradigm of Human-RobotInteraction (HRI), which positions robots as interaction peers, as a potentially suitable model to achieve more effective influence through defining and exploiting the interactivity of robots (that is, their ability to moderate their issued sociocontextual cues based on the behavioral information read from humans). In this paper, we investigate whether increasing a robot's interactivity will increase the effectiveness of its influence on people in public spaces. A two-part study (total n = 273) was conducted in both a major Australian public train station (n = 84 + 105) and a university (n = 84) where passersby encountered a robot, designed with various levels of interactivity, which attempted to influence their passage. The findings suggest that the Robot Centric HRI paradigm generalizes to other robots and application spaces, and enables deliberate moderation of a robot's interactivity, facilitating more nuanced, predictable and systematic influence, and thus yielding greater effectiveness.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520657","Non-verbal Cues;Social and contextual cues;Participant roles;HRI Paradigm","Robot sensing systems;Task analysis;Space stations;Psychology;Decision making;Human computer interaction","human-robot interaction","public spaces;passenger flow;congested train stations;behavioral information;Australian public train station;nuanced influence;predictable influence;systematic influence;human-robot interaction;robot centric HRI paradigm;socio-contextual cues;robot centric paradigm;socio-contextual interactivity","","","","27","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Another model combining data from both individual and group interactions is also investigated. We perform these experiments in the context of predicting disengagement behaviors in children interacting with two social robots. Our results show that a model trained with group data generalizes better to individual participants than the other way around.

With the growing sophistication and proliferation of robots, it is important to understand how ordinary people apply moral norms to robot agents and make moral judgments about their behavior. We report the first comparison of people's moral judgments (of permissibility, wrongness, and blame) about human and robot agents. Two online experiments (total N = 316) found that robots, compared with human agents, were more strongly expected to take an action that sacrifices one person for the good of many (a “utilitarian” choice), and they were blamed more than their human counterparts when they did not make that choice. Though the utilitarian sacrifice was generally seen as permissible for human agents, they were blamed more for choosing this option than for doing nothing. These results provide a first step toward a new field of Moral HRI, which is well placed to help guide the design of social robots.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520656","Robot Ethics;Machine Morality;Human-Robot Interaction;Moral Psychology","Ethics;Robot kinematics;Psychology;Standards;Face;Linguistics","human factors;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;multi-agent systems;social sciences","moral norms;sophistication;moral HRI;human counterparts;proliferation;human interaction;robot agents;social robots;human agents;utilitarian sacrifice","","","","48","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to answer this question we designed a novel experimental paradigm in which a child plays an education tablet app with an autonomous social robot, which is portrayed as a younger peer. We manipulated the robot's behavior to be either curiosity-driven or not and measured the child's curiosity after the interaction. We show that some of the child's curiosity measures are significantly higher after interacting with a curious robot, compared to a non-curious one, while others do not.

One option for conveying the actions and intent of users or autonomous agents is to provide force guidance from one user to another. Under this paradigm, forces would be transmitted from one user to another in order to guide motions and actions. However, the use of force guidance to convey intent can mask environmental force feedback. In this paper we explore the possibility of using tactile feedback, in particular skin deformation feedback, skin deformation feedback to convey collaborative intent while preserving environmental force perception. An experiment was performed to test the ability of participants to use force guidance and skin deformation guidance to follow a path while interacting with a virtual environment. In addition, we tested the ability of participants to discriminate virtual environment stiffness when receiving either force guidance or skin deformation guidance. We found that skin deformation guidance resulted in a reduction of path-following accuracy, but increased the ability to discriminate environment stiffness when compared with force feedback guidance.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520624","Skin deformation;skin stretch;virtual fixtures;stiffness discrimination;haptics","Skin;Force;Strain;Apertures;Force feedback;Task analysis","control engineering computing;force feedback;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;skin;telerobotics;virtual reality","environment perception;multilateral collaborative teleoperation;autonomous agents;force guidance;environmental force feedback;tactile feedback;collaborative intent;environmental force perception;skin deformation guidance;virtual environment stiffness;force feedback guidance;user intent;skin deformation feedback;tactile guidance virtual fixtures;teleoperation system;kinesthetic fixtures","","","","20","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One major reason is that the research in this domain does not have a strong focus on the efficacy of robots. Robots in ASD therapy are end-user oriented technologies, the success of which depends on their demonstrated efficacy in real settings.

We contribute to a growing body of work that explores this question and maps out simulated-versus-real differences, by explicitly investigating empathy: how people empathize with a physical or simulated robot when something bad happens to it. Our results suggest that people may empathize more with a physical robot than a simulated one, a finding that has important implications on the generalizability and applicability of simulated HRI work. Empathy is particularly relevant to social HRI and is integral to, for example, companion and care robots.

Social shaping focuses attention on social factors that affect the use and interpretation of technology in particular contexts. We therefore aimed to understand how different social actors make sense of and use PARO in daily interaction. Our results show participant gender, social mediation, and individual sense making led to differential use and interpretation of the robot, which affected the success of human-robot interactions.

In the robot side, voice sources are localized and separated by using multiple microphone arrays and human tracking technologies, while in the operator side, the operator's head movement is tracked and used to relocate the spatial positions of the separated sources. Interaction experiments with humans in the robot environment indicated that the proposed system had significantly higher accuracy rates for perceived direction of sounds, and higher subjective scores for sense of presence and listenability, compared to a baseline system using stereo binaural sounds obtained by two microphones located at the humanoid robot's ears. We also proposed three different user interfaces for augmented auditory scene control.

However, in that design, the robot that actively cheated also generated more motion than the other conditions. In this paper, we investigate whether the additional movement of the cheating gesture is responsible for the increased agency and intentionality or whether the act of cheating itself triggers this response. In a between-participant design with 83 participants, we disambiguate between these causes by testing (1) the cases of the robot cheating to win, (2) cheating to lose, (3) cheating to tie from a winning position, and (4) cheating to tie from a losing position. Despite the fact that the robot changes its gesture to cheat in all four conditions, we find that participants are more likely to report the gesture change when the robot cheated to win from a losing position, compared with the other conditions. Participants in that same condition are also far more likely to protest in the form of an utterance following the cheat and report that the robot is less fair and honest. It is therefore the adversarial cheat itself that causes the effect and not the change in gesture, providing evidence for a cheating detector that can be triggered by robots.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520644","Human Robot Interaction;Cheating;Cheating Detector;Agency","Detectors;Rocks;Games;Toy manufacturing industry;Human-robot interaction;Robot sensing systems","gesture recognition;humanoid robots","adversarial cheat;cheating detector;robots trigger;human participant;humanoid robot;intentionality;cheating gesture;between-participant design;robot cheating;winning position;gesture change","","","","14","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In several embodied design improvisation sessions, we observed a tension between people perceiving the ottoman as a living being, such as a pet, and simultaneously as a functional object, which requests that they place their feet on it-something they would not ordinarily do with a pet. In a follow-up lab study (N=20), we found that most participants did make use of the footstool, although several chose not to place their feet on it for this reason. We also found that participants who rested their feet understood a brief lift and drop movement as a request to withdraw, and formed detailed notions about the footstool's agenda, ascribing intentions based on its movement alone.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520640","Embodied Design Improvisation;Laboratory Experiment;Wizard of Oz;Metaphors;Social Attribution","Robot kinematics;Prototypes;Handover;Task analysis;Floors","furniture;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;service robots","mechanical ottoman;robotic footstool;nonanthropomorphic robots;robotic furniture","","","","36","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we explore this issue by evaluating the effect of a social robot tutoring strategy with children learning about prime numbers. It is shown that the tutoring strategy itself leads to improvement, but that the presence of a robot employing this strategy amplifies this effect, resulting in significant learning. However, it was also found that children interacting with a robot using social and adaptive behaviours in addition to the teaching strategy did not learn a significant amount. These results indicate that while the presence of a physical robot leads to improved learning, caution is required when applying social behaviour to a robot in a tutoring context.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520661","Robot Tutor;Social HRI;Child-Robot Interaction;Social Behaviour","Task analysis;Education;Face;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Sorting","educational robots;human-robot interaction;teaching","child learning;social robots;implicit assumption;adaptive behaviour;social robot tutoring strategy;children learning;teaching strategy;physical robot;social behaviour","","","","26","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Can the presence of a robot facilitate honest behavior? In this paper, we describe an experimental study evaluating the effects of robot social presence on people's honesty. Participants completed a perceptual task, which is structured so as to allowthem to earn more money by not complying with the experiment instructions. We compare three conditions between subjects: Completing the task alone in a room; completing it with a non-monitoring human present; and completing it with a non-monitoring robot present. The robot is a new expressive social head capable of 4-DoF head movement and screen-based eye animation, specifically designed and built for this research. It was designed to convey social presence, but not monitoring. We find that people cheat in all three conditions, but cheat equally less when there is a human or a robot in the room, compared to when they are alone. We did not find differences in the perceived authority of the human and the robot, but did find that people felt significantly less guilty after cheating inthe presence of a robot as compared to a human. This has implications for the use of robots in monitoring and supervising tasks in environments in which honesty is key.

That is, when a visitor intends to talk to a staff member and starts to approach, the staff member also walks a few steps toward the visitors in advance to being talked. Further, even when not being approached, staff members exhibit ''availability'' behavior in the case that a visitor's intention seems uncertain. We modeled these behaviors that are adaptive to pedestrians' intentions, occurred prior to initiation of conversation. The model was implemented into a robot and tested in a real shopping mall. The experiment confirmed that the proposed method is less intrusive to pedestrians, and that our robot successfully initiated interaction with pedestrians.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520646","Intention estimation;Initiation of interaction;Behavior Design","Collaboration;Micromechanical devices;Adaptation models;Estimation;Robot sensing systems;Task analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);robot programming","availability behavior;nearby visitors;service staff members;shopping mall;polite approaching behavior","","","","29","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many practical applications, human operators may need to change the current behavior of a swarm from the goal that the swarm was going towards into a new goal due to dynamic changes in mission objectives. There are two related but distinct capabilities needed to supervise a robotic swarm. The first is comprehension of the swarm's state and the second is prediction of the effects of human inputs on the swarm's behavior. Both of them are very challenging. Prior work in the literature has shown that inserting the human input as soon as possible to divert the swarm from its original goal towards the new goal does not always result in optimal performance (measured by some criterion such as the total time required by the swarm to reach the second goal). This phenomenon has been called Neglect Benevolence, conveying the idea that in many cases it is preferable to neglect the swarm for some time before inserting human input. In this paper, we study how humans can develop an understanding of swarm dynamics so they can predict the effects of the timing of their input on the state and performance of the swarm. We developed the swarm configuration shape-changing Neglect Benevolence Task as a Human Swarm Interaction (HSI) reference task allowing comparison between human and optimal input timing performance in control of swarms. Our results show that humans can learn to approximate optimal timing and that displays which make consensus variables perceptually accessible can enhance performance.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520642","Human-Robot Interaction;Robotic Swarms","Robots;Task analysis;Timing;Heuristic algorithms;Trajectory;Prediction algorithms;Water heating","human-robot interaction;multi-robot systems;optimisation","robotic swarm;human operators;swarm dynamics;swarm configuration shape-changing Neglect Benevolence Task;Human Swarm Interaction reference task;human input timing performance;optimal input timing performance;distributed systems","","5","","40","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For better or worse, broad technological expectations of the future (aesthetic and otherwise) are largely set by exposure to science fiction in popular culture. These depictions have a direct impact on attitudes toward new technology. We review some common tropes of science fiction (including the idea of the “singularity” and killer robots) and examine why certain archetypes might persist while others fall by the wayside. From the perspective of a scientist-turned-sci-fi-author, we discuss factors that go into the creation of science fiction and how these factors may or may not correspond to the needs and wants of the actual science community. Exposure to science fiction influences scientists and the general public, both to build and adopt new technologies.

The lack of online learning in HRI to date can be attributed to at least two unsolved challenges: random exploration (a core component of most online-learning algorithms) and the slow convergence rates of previous online-learning algorithms. However, several recently developed online-learning algorithms have beenreported to learn at much faster rates than before, which makes them candidates for use in human-robot interactions. In this paper, we explore the ability of these algorithms to learn to interact with people. Via user study, we show that these algorithms alone do not consistently learn to collaborate with human partners. Similarly, we observe that humans fail to consistently collaborate with each other in the absence of explicit communication. However, we demonstrate that one algorithm does learn to effectively collaborate with people when paired with a novel cheap-talk communication system. In addition to this technical achievement, this work highlights the need to address AI and HRI synergistically rather than independently.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520623","Human-Robot Interaction;Online Learning;Cheap Talk","Robots;Games;Logic gates;Human-robot interaction;Collaboration;Senior citizens;Machine learning algorithms","computer aided instruction;human-robot interaction","human partner;human relationships;online learning;human-robot interactions;humans;online-learning algorithms","","","","22","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the demonstrated action sequences are clustered into different human types using an unsupervised learning algorithm. A reward function is then learned for each type through the employment of an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. The learned model is then incorporated into a mixed-observability Markov decision process (MOMDP) formulation, wherein the human type is a partially observable variable. With this framework, we can infer online the human type of a new user that was not included in the training set, and can compute a policy for the robot that will be aligned to the preference of this user. In a human subject experiment (n=30), participants agreed more strongly that the robot anticipated their actions when working with a robot incorporating the proposed framework (p<;0.01), compared to manually annotating robot actions. In trials where participants faced difficulty annotating the robot actions to complete the task, the proposed framework significantly improved team efficiency (p <;0.01). The robot incorporating the framework was also found to be more responsive to human actions compared to policies computed using a hand-coded reward function by a domain expert (p<;0.01).

This presents near-term opportunities for teleoperated robots in the home. However, a teleoperator's remote presence in a consumer's home presents serious security and privacy risks, and the concerns of end-users about these risks may hinder the adoption of such in-home robots. In this paper, we define and explore the privacy-utility tradeoff for remotely teleoperated robots: as we reduce the quantity or fidelity of visual information received by the teleoperator to preserve the end-user's privacy, we must balance this against the teleoperator's need for sufficient information to successfully carry out tasks. We explore this tradeoff with two surveys that provide a framework for understanding the privacy attitudes of end-users, and with a user study that empirically examines the effect of different filters of visual information on the ability of a teleoperator to carry out a task. Our findings include that respondents do desire privacy protective measures from teleoperators, that respondents prefer certain visual filters from a privacy perspective, and that, for the studied task, we can identify a filter that balances privacy with utility. We make recommendations for in-home teleoperation based on these findings.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520631","Privacy;Remote teleoperation","Privacy;Task analysis;Teleoperators;Robot sensing systems;Visualization;Security","data privacy;telerobotics","remotely teleoperated robots;space exploration;human-populated environments;house cleaning;teleoperator;consumer;end-users;in-home robots;visual information;privacy attitudes;in-home teleoperation;privacy protective measures;near-term opportunities;privacy-utility","","","","24","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whether such integration is possible when the multi-modal communication information is produced by a humanoid robot, and whether it is as efficient as for human communicators, are questions that need to be answered to further understanding of the efficacy of humanoid robots for naturalistic human-like communication. Here, we present an experiment which, using a fully within subjects design, shows that there is a marked difference in speech and gesture integration between human and robot communicators, being significantly less effective for the robot. In contrast to beat gestures, the effects of speech emphasis are the same whether that speech is played through a robot or as part of a video of a human. Thus, while integration of speech emphasis and verbal information do occur for robot communicators, integration of non-informative beat gestures and verbal information does not, despite comparable timing and motion profiles to human gestures.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520645","Human-robot interaction;Gestures;Humanoid Robots","Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Humanoid robots;Timing;Semantics;Syntactics","gesture recognition;humanoid robots;speech processing","gesture emphasis effects;human communicators;co-verbal gestures;semantic meaning;human communication;syntactic disambiguation;multimodal communication information;humanoid robot;gesture integration;robot communicators;speech emphasis;verbal information;noninformative beat gestures;human gestures","","","","34","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We therefore hypothesize that group effects might similarly occur when people face multiple robots. Further, group effects might vary for robots of different types. In this exploratory study, we used videos to expose participants in a between-subjects experiment to robots varying in Number (Single or Group) and Type (anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or mechanomorphic). We then measured participants' general attitudes, emotions, and stereotypes toward robots with a combination of measures from HRI (e.g., Godspeed Questionnaire, NARS) and social psychology (e.g., Big Five, Social Threat, Emotions). Results suggest that Number and Type of observed robots had an interaction effect on responses toward robots in general, leading to more positive responses for groups for some robot types, but more negative responses for others.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520647","Human-robot interaction;inter-group interactions;group effects;robot type;emotion;attitudes;stereotypes","Robot kinematics;Psychology;Videos;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Human-robot interaction","human-robot interaction;multi-robot systems;social aspects of automation","robots effects;emotions;stereotypes;human-robot interaction;group effects;multiple robots;interaction effect;robot types;HRI","","","","38","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this study we investigate the inclusion of the additional social modalities, namely head pose and facial expression, as nonverbal behaviour has been shown to be an important conveyor of information in both social and musical contexts. Following a 6 week experimental study using automatic behavioural metrics, results demonstrate those subjected to nonverbal behaviours not only spent more time voluntarily with the robot, but actually increased the time they spent as the trial progressed. Further, that they interrupted the robot less during social interactions and played for longer uninterrupted. Conversely, they also looked at the robot less in both musical and social contexts.

The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote nonaggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to-human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520619","Human-robot interaction;Design;Robotic companions;Behavior change;Empathy;Ambient kinetic tangibles;Smartphone robots.","Animation;Robot sensing systems;Monitoring;Shape;Kinetic theory","gesture recognition;human factors;humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;interactive systems","robotic devices;reacting robot;peripheral empathy-evoking robotic conversation companion;nonaggressive conversation;design process;design goals;human-human interaction;Kip1;social human character traits;robot autonomous behavior;gaze attention","","","","24","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is currently unknown whether people with PD would even accept a robot as part of their healthcare processes. We thus conducted a first humanrobot interaction study to assess the extent to which people with PD are willing to discuss their health status with a robot. We specifically compared a robot interviewer to a human interviewer in a within-subjects design that allowed us to control for individual differences of the subjects with PD caused by their individual disease progression. We found that participants overall reacted positively to the robot, even though they preferred interactions with the human interviewer. Importantly, the robot performed at a human level at maintaining the participants' dignity, which is critical for future social mediator robots for people with PD.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520626","Assistive robots;Parkinson’s disease;quantitative field study","Educational robots;Parkinson's disease;Task analysis;Medical treatment","diseases;health care;human-robot interaction;medical robotics","HRI study;Parkinson's disease;facial masking;robot mediators;caregiver-client relationships;individual disease progression;future social mediator robots;human-robot interaction study;health status surveys","","","","22","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early recognition, which is also known as activity prediction, is an ability to infer an ongoing activity at its early stage. We present an algorithm to recognize human activities targeting the camera from streaming videos, enabling the robot to predict intended activities of the interacting person as early as possible and take fast reactions to such activities (e.g., avoiding harmful events targeting itself before they actually occur). We introduce the novel concept of'onset' that efficiently summarizes pre-activity observations, and design a recognition approach to consider event history in addition to visual features from first-person videos. We propose to represent an onset using a cascade histogram of time series gradients, and we describe a novel algorithmic setup to take advantage of such onset for early recognition of activities. The experimental results clearly illustrate that the proposed concept of onset enables better/earlier recognition of human activities from first-person videos collected with a robot.","2167-2121","978-1-4503-2882-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520648","Activity recognition;first-person videos;human-robot interaction","Videos;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Human-robot interaction;Activity recognition;Feature extraction","gradient methods;human-robot interaction;robot vision;time series","first-person videos;human activities;robot-centric activity prediction;robot recognition;human-robot interactions;robot-centric videos;streaming videos;interacting person;recognition approach","","","","20","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers are aware of the need to develop the right kinds of robots with appropriate, natural ways for them to interact with humans. However, much of human perception and cognition occurs outside of conscious awareness, and how robotic agents engage these processes is currently unknown. Here, we explored automatic, reflexive social attention, which operates outside of conscious control within a fraction of a second to discover whether and how these processes generalize to agents with varying humanlikeness in their form and motion. Using a social variant of a well-established spatial attention paradigm, we tested whether robotic or human appearance and/or motion influenced an agent's ability to capture or direct implicit social attention. In each trial, either images or videos of agents looking to one side of space (a head turn) were presented to human observers. We measured reaction time to a peripheral target as an index of attentional capture and direction. We found that all agents, regardless of humanlike form or motion, were able to direct spatial attention in the cued direction. However, differences in the form of the agent affected attentional capture, i.e., how quickly the observers could disengage attention from the agent and respond to the target. This effect further interacted with whether the spatial cue (head turn) was presented through static images or videos. Overall whereas reflexive social attention operated in the same manner for human and robot social agents for spatial attentional cueing, robotic appearance, as well as whether the agent was static or moving significantly influenced unconscious attentional capture processes. These studies reveal how unconscious social attentional processes operate when the agent is a human vs. a robot, add novel manipulations to the literature such as the role of visual motion, and provide a link between attention studies in HRI, and decades of research on unconscious social attention in experimental psychology and vision science.Categories and Subject Descriptors H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems -Human factors.

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced benefits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry.By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, a NAo humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been configured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models.Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children's use of the novel system. Children aged 6-8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with.

Aim of this work was the development of a silica nanoparticle based system for in vitro molecular imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma, using both ultrasound and laser-scanning confocal microscopy, by exploiting the particular feature of these tumor cells to express on their surface high levels of Glypican-3 protein (GPC-3). At this regard, we have designed and characterized novel GPC-3 ligand peptide-functionalized fluorescent silica nanoparticles and tested them on GPC-3 positive HepG2 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line. Laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis showed that GPC-3-targeted fuorescent SiNP, in the concentration range used for experimental ultrasound detection, did not exert significant cytotoxic effects and were effectively bound and taken up by HepG2 cells. These results suggest that silica nanoparticles might be a very promising contrast agents for non-ionizing ultrasound molecular imaging since of their high biocompatibility, targeting effectiveness and ultrasound enhancement power.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425273","silica nanoparticles;hepatocellular carcinoma;molecular targeting;functionalization","Nanoparticles;Silicon compounds;Microscopy;Fluorescence;Ultrasonic imaging;Peptides;Molecular imaging","biochemistry;biomedical materials;biomedical optical imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;cellular biophysics;drugs;fluorescence;laser applications in medicine;molecular biophysics;nanofabrication;nanomedicine;nanoparticles;optical microscopy;proteins;silicon compounds;toxicology;tumours","human hepatocarcinoma cell line;laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis;experimental ultrasound detection;ultrasound molecular imaging;ultrasound enhancement power;targeted drug delivery;acoustic properties;ultrasound contrast;cytotoxic effects;GPC-3 ligand peptide-functionalized fluorescent silica nanoparticles;Glypican-3 positive HepG2 cells;tumor cells;non-ionizing echographic molecular imaging;SiO2","","1","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from commercial PLA pellets, films were extruded and cardanol-based nanovescicles embedded with porphyrin were deposited on these PLA films by simple casting of the aqueous vescicular nanodispersion. The functionalized PLA films were then studied by mechanical testing. SEM-FEG characterization, and UV-visible measurements were performed to investigate the presence of cardanol-based nanodispersion on the film and the acid response of porphyrin.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425340","biopolymers;poly(lactic acid) (PLA);food packaging;porphyrin;cardanol;green nanovesicles;mechanical properties","Films;Programmable logic arrays;Surface treatment;Coatings;Polymers;Antibacterial activity;Absorption","casting;polymer films;scanning electron microscopy;ultraviolet spectra;visible spectra","SEM-FEG;UV-visible spectra;thin films;casting;aqueous vescicular nanodispersion;mechanical testing;poly(lactic acid);polymer;extrusion;cardanol-based nanodispersion;porphyrin molecules;cardanol-based nanovesicles","","","","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this material the dielectric constant can assume very large values especially when increasing the operating temperature. As a consequence the Debye length can increase so that the sensor changes from a `large grain' behavior to a `small grain' one. This is true indeed for nano-grained powder. The sensitivity of nano-grains is higher but a complete depletion can occur saturating therefore the sensors. The case of spherical grains will be discussed in order to point out that, given the grain size, the variations of the material characteristics change the behavior.

Graphene is a 2-D single layer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms characterized by high specific surface area, Young's modulus, thermal stability, mobility of charge carriers and plus fascinating transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Among several developed methods to prepare graphene, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and mechanical exfoliation, the chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) is regarded as the most promising for future implementation in large-scale production. In this work, a GO prepared by a modified Hummers method was used and reduced by a green method based on UV treatment in inert atmosphere. Graphene oxide reduction was monitored evaluating the change of absorption peak by UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), monitoring the decrease of the oxygen groups linked to carbon. Dilute nanocomposites suspensions were then prepared by optimizing the dispersion procedure of GO in the polymeric matrix as function of process parameters, i.e. time, temperature and composition. Nanocomposite films were also realized by spin coating on different substrates and characterized by several techniques. At last the film showing the better properties was implemented in a hybrid solar cell to evaluate the increase of electrical conductivity and power conversion efficiency.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425328","Polymeric nanocomposite;graphene;hybrid solar cells;hybrid perovskite","Nanocomposites;Polymers;Atmosphere;Graphene;Photovoltaic cells;Absorption;Films","carbon;chemical vapour deposition;electrical conductivity;filled polymers;graphene;nanocomposites;oxidation;polymers;quantum Hall effect;reduction (chemical);solar cells;spin coating;suspensions;thermal stability;thin films;ultraviolet spectra;visible spectra;X-ray photoelectron spectra;Young's modulus","chemical reduction;UV treatment;graphene oxide reduction;UV-visible spectroscopy;polymeric matrix;nanocomposite films;hybrid solar cell;electrical conductivity;innovative hybrid solar cells;polymeric nanocomposites;polymeric matrices;solid-state hybrid solar cells;organometal trihalide perovskite absorbers;mechanical exfoliation;Hummers method","","","","40","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design and processing of conductive elements as electrodes directly in a polymeric bulk material can be considered as an interesting improvement. By this way, the use of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) instrument with its accurate and precise motorized table and its implemented laser can be used for designing conductive elements in polymeric materials. In that case, 805 nm infrared (IR) laser light from the AFM instrument inducing surface texturing on Chitosan/Au Precursor (C/AuP) substrate is reported. Surface patterns consisting of designed structures were produced by laser texturing. By fine-tuning key parameters as the programmed movement of the motorized table supporting the substrate in accordance to the laser movement as well as the working distance, Au nanoparticles (AuNP) were locally generated. Micro patterns have been generated on the nanocomposite C/AuP surface. By the use of NCM able to generate in-situ nanoparticles (NP) under light stimulation, micro structures can be generated on the NCM surfaces, preserving their flexibility and easy processability.

Recently a plethora of novel nanomaterials were developed as contrast agents and/or drug delivery systems. In this work, we report the use of micro-bubbles and gold nanorods (GNRs) as vascular contrast agents for the characterization of tumor micro-environment, combining HF-US and PA imaging. A bolus of 50μL of untargeted micro-bubbles and a bolus of 150μL of GNRs solution were injected intravenously in two male colon cancer xenograft mice and detected with a commercial PA-US imaging system. The subcutaneous tumor dimensions were assessed by means of B-mode images (146.48 mm2and 24.56 mm2); different perfusion parameters were estimated tracking the micro-bubbles (peak enhancement map; time to peak 51,3s, 58,7s and 39s and wash-in rate 35,5s, 5,4s and 109,4s for different tumor regions); the real time distribution of GNRs in the tumor was assessed by means of the amplitude variation of the PA signal during time (30 % increase of the PA signal 28 min after injection). The combination of HF-US and PA imaging could become an efficient and non invasive tool for the in vivo and real-time evaluation of the tissue viability, to visualize the map of perfusion and monitoring the efficacy of drug/nano-particle delivery. The use of targeted microbubbles and nanoparticles could open new avenues for the real-time mapping of specific cell epitopes and phenotypes.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425331","photoacoustic imaging;ultrasound imaging;gold nanorods;nanoimaging;microbubbles;nanomedicine","Tumors;Ultrasonic imaging;Real-time systems;Gold;Blood;Photoacoustic imaging","biomedical optical imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;bubbles;cancer;cellular biophysics;drug delivery systems;drugs;gold;molecular biophysics;nanomedicine;nanoparticles;nanorods;tumours","GNR solution;perfusion parameters;tumor regions;morpho-functional information;nanomaterials;gold nanorods;PA-US imaging system;drug-nanoparticle delivery;specific cell epitopes;phenotypes;HF -US;photoacoustic technology;tissue characterization;photoacoustic imaging;high frequency ultrasound;real-time mapping;tissue viability;real-time evaluation;B-mode images;subcutaneous tumor dimensions;male colon cancer xenograft mice;untargeted microbubbles;tumor microenvironment;vascular contrast agents;drug delivery systems;target tissue;molecular information;time 51.3 s;time 58.7 s;time 35.5 s;time 5.4 s;time 28.0 min;time 39.0 s;time 109.4 s","","","","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Biological and chemical analysis are achieved by functionalizing the gold surface with surface bioreceptors and measuring the shift of corresponding optical signals when a biomolecular reaction occurs. In order to increase the sensing performances two strategies have been adopted: a proper combination of noble metal and ferromagnetic materials tailored on the nanoscale is used as novel transducer in SPR-based biosensor coupled with an external magnetic field; and a new 3D transductor consisting of silica nanowires decorated by gold nanoparticles have been realized to increase the performance of sensing devices In both case increasing biosensing performance have been demonstrated.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425347","biosensors;plasmonics;magneto-plasmonics","Plasmons;Gold;Biosensors;Optical sensors;Magnetic fields","biosensors;dielectric materials;ferromagnetic materials;gas sensors;gold;magnetic field measurement;magnetic sensors;molecular biophysics;nanoparticles;nanosensors;nanowires;plasmonics;refractive index measurement;saturable core reactors;silicon compounds;surface plasmon resonance;transducers","biomolecular reaction;SPR-based biosensor;label-free biosensing;optical detection;metal layer;excitation light beam;chemical analysis;surface bioreceptors;optical signals;nanoparticles;surface plasmon resonance;refractive index detection;localised plasmonic;magnetoplasmonic transductor;gas sensor;metal-dielectric interface;biological analysis;ferromagnetic materials;external magnetic field sensor;3D transductor;silica nanowires;SiO2-Au","","1","","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At 40 V the current of PCD film grown on p-Si is one order of magnitude higher than one on i-Si.

For example, coatings based on zinc oxide (ZnO) have been reported to show significant antimicrobial effects. With this aim, PLA films were extruded starting from commercial pellets and then functionalized by thin coatings made of nanostructured aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO). A set of AZO coatings was deposited at different sputtering power, and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) inspection. X-ray diffraction was used to evaluate the structural properties of the AZO coatings. Optical transmission measurements revealed high transparency of the AZO-coated PLA films, with transmittance values around 80-90% in the visible range. Preliminary release tests were conducted by putting the coated films in contact with a fixed volume of a physiological saline solution and the amount of released AZO particles was evaluated by spectrophotometric measurements.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425326","food packaging;polylactic acid (PLA);nanostructured zinc oxide coatings","Programmable logic arrays;Films;Coatings;Zinc oxide;Substrates;Packaging;II-VI semiconductor materials","aluminium;antibacterial activity;II-VI semiconductors;nanocomposites;scanning electron microscopy;sputtered coatings;thin films;transparency;ultraviolet spectra;visible spectra;wide band gap semiconductors;X-ray diffraction;zinc compounds","coatings;thin films;polylactic acid;antimicrobial effects;extrusion;sputtering;scanning electron microscopy;SEM;X-ray diffraction;structural properties;optical transmission;transparency;physiological saline solution;spectrophotometry;nanostructured aluminum-doped zinc oxide;ZnO:Al","","","","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performed MTT assay showed that HNTs have a high biocompatibility, also when coated with polymers, while curcumin is highly toxic for cancer cells. The release kinetics of curcumin from HNTs was investigated by the dialysis bag method, showing a slow and constant release of the drug, which can be further controlled by adding layers of polymers to the external surface of the tubes.

In this study the Schiff base of chitosan was synthesized by the reaction with cinnamaldehyde at different concentrations. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic α,ß-unsaturated aldehyde, and the major component in essential oils from some cinnamon species. It has been shown to exert antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, yeasts, and mould. The formation of the Schiff base is reversible under suitable conditions, and this might allow the release of the active cinnamaldehyde from chitosan, used as the carrier.

However, because of complex polymer-polymer and polymer-nanostructure interactions, the estimation of the dispersion is far from trivial. Dynamic rheological functions are mostly used to estimate the quality of dispersion. However, these rheological functions are sensitive to complex molecular architectures such as branching; thus, the accuracy of these rheological functions is limited for nanocomposites obtained using polymer matrices with these molecular architectures. Therefore, an estimation of the dispersion using other approaches needs to be explored. In this work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are firstly dispersed in a polyamide matrix by a low-frequency ultrasound-assisted extrusion process (kHz range). Then, high-frequency ultrasound wave propagation (MHz range) is used to estimate the dispersion of CNTs in polyamide matrices with different branching architectures. The quality of dispersion observed through the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient of the material matches with optical microscopy studies, in contrast with results obtained using dynamic rheological functions. Dynamic mechanical deformation induced by high-frequency ultrasound seems to be less sensitive to branching architectures, thus giving a better estimation of the quality of dispersion.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425327","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425327","nanofiller;ultrasonic wave propagation;rheology;polymer;chain branching","Dispersion;Plastics;Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustics;Viscosity;Estimation;Optical imaging","carbon nanotubes;deformation;extrusion;filled polymers;high-frequency effects;nanocomposites;nanofabrication;nanomechanics;optical microscopy;rheology;ultrasonic absorption;wave propagation","complex molecular architectures;nanocomposites;polymer-nanostructure interactions;dynamic rheological functions;CNTs;polyamide matrix;high-frequency ultrasound wave propagation;low-frequency ultrasound-assisted extrusion;carbon nanotubes;ultrasonic attenuation coefficient;optical microscopy;dynamic mechanical deformation;C","","1","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We correlate this finding to the Al-rich composition of the tapered region, as deduced by scanning-TEM (STEM) mass contrast analysis, this region being the effect of residual Au-assisted self-assembly of the material during shell overgrowth. In addition a few percent of NWs show branching during their growth, and we determine the crystal properties and defects of branched NWs.

However, each imaging technique typically requires its own specific CAs, with corresponding increments of procedure duration, costs and invasiveness for the patients, who should undergo two injections. In the last years, great effort has been addressed toward the development of multimodal CAs that can be real-time detected by different techniques. In this context, we developed a new type of bimodal nanoparticles (NPs), consisting of silica nanospheres (NSs) covered by an outer shell of smaller superparamagnetic NPs, to be used as dual-mode imaging CAs for ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the echographic detectability of these bimodal NPs through a recently developed algorithm that was originally implemented to detect pure silica NSs. In particular, we performed a series of “in vitro” experiments on custom-designed tissue- mimicking phantoms, focused on a specific objective of direct clinical interest: the detection of multimodal NPs with a diameter of about 330 nm at a low and biocompatible volume concentration (0.2 %). The obtained results demonstrated the possibility of deleting the US echoes coming from structures other than NPs with high effectiveness, therefore enhancing the brightness of nanosized contrast agents in the final diagnostic images. The effectiveness of the proposed method shows very promising perspectives for future clinical applications.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425280","multimodal contrast agents;nanoparticles;MRI;ultrasound;nanoparticle detection","Magnetic resonance imaging;Silicon compounds;Phantoms;Ultrasonic imaging;Nanoparticles;Imaging phantoms","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;biomedical ultrasonics;biomimetics;magnetic particles;medical image processing;nanofabrication;nanomagnetics;nanomedicine;nanoparticles;phantoms;silicon compounds;superparamagnetism","dual frequency ultrasound technique;biomedical imaging technique;silica nanospheres;magnetic resonance imaging techniques;echographic detectability;multimodal contrast agents;superparamagnetic nanoparticles;custom-designed tissue-mimicking phantoms;dual-mode imaging contrast agents;bimodal nanoparticle contrast agents;size 330.0 nm","","","","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this work was to investigate the ability of polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles (PMMA-NPs) to act as vehicle of an oligonucleotide molecular beacon (MB) targeting survivin mRNA in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells. Furthermore, this paper focuses the attention on the need for having an appropriate healthy control in in-vitro experiments. In particular, the survivin-MB was firstly characterized in solution in order to verify its functionality and then the PMMA-NPs ability to promote the MB internalization was verified in A549 cells by confocal microscopy. Confluent Human Dermal Fibroblasts from adult (HDFa) were used as healthy control. The results showed that PMMA-NPs promote the survivin-MB cellular up-take and that the use of 10 μg/mL PMMA-NPs as carrier for survivin-MB for 1h 30 min might be a promising strategy to reduce cancer cell proliferation avoiding detectable consequences on the healthy cells.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425357","molecular beacon;survivin;nanoparticles;cancer cells;fibroblasts","Cancer;Fluorescence;Nanoparticles;Fibroblasts;Microscopy;Proteins;Physiology","biomedical materials;cancer;cellular biophysics;drug delivery systems;molecular biophysics;nanomedicine;nanoparticles;optical microscopy;polymers;proteins;tumours","polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles;antisense oligonucleotide molecular beacons;fluorescent signal;target mRNA;pharmacological silencing activity;cancer development;tumor cells;A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells;MB internalization;cancer cell proliferation;oligonucleotide molecular beacon;survivin mRNA;protein overexpression;confocal microscopy;human dermal fibroblasts;survivin-MB cellular up-take","","","","8","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The enhancement of diamond nucleation and growth on Si substrates is achieved by using a sputter deposition of different metallic (Cr, Nb, Ti, V, and W) nanolayers and an ultrasonic seeding with NDs. We conclude that the kinetics of diamond nucleation in the NCD film growth is determined by the number density of NDs embedded on the nanorough metallic surfaces after ultrasonic pretreatment and by the specific surface chemistry (i.e., carbon diffusivity and carburization) during diamond growth. Second., the synthesis and application of composites based on microdiamonds and NDs for the photocatalytic degradation of diphenhydramine pharmaceutical water pollutant is demonstrated.

The limits of flashback and blowoff were recorded in presence and in absence of the plasma actuation.

Afterwards, it was proposed to exploit this property in order to use nanostructured materials as ignition agents for fuel mixtures. Finally, in 2011 it was shown that SWCNTs can be effectively used as ignition source for an air/ethylene mixture filling a constant volume combustion chamber; the observed combustion presented the characteristics of a homogeneous-like combustion. In this paper a system for the ignition of an air/methane mixture is proposed, based on the exposition of multi wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to a low consumption flash camera. Namely, several experiments have been run in which 20 mg of MWCNTs, containing 75% in weight of ferrocene, have been added to an air/methane fuel mixture inside a constant volume combustion chamber. The mixture has been heated up to 373 K and the onset pressure was set equal to 3 bar. The experiments have been run varying the equivalence ratio in the range 1-2. The combustion process so realized has been compared to that obtained igniting the mixture with a traditional spark as in spark ignition engines. The comparison has been based on chamber pressure measurement as well as combustion process images, both sampled at a frequency equal to 2,5 kHz for an overall duration of 1.8 s. Results confirm that the ignition triggered with MWCNTs leads to a homogeneous-like combustion, without observing a well-defined flame front propagation. The contrary is observed, as expected, with the spark assisted ignition. Moreover, dynamic pressure measurements show that, compared to spark assisted ignition, the MWCNTs photo-ignition determines a more rapid pressure gradient and a higher peak pressure which corresponds to a higher energy release rate.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425275","Nanotubes;HCCI;SWCNTs;MWCNTs;ignition;spark ignition engines","Combustion;Ignition;Sparks;Fuels;Bars;Cameras","combustion;gas mixtures;ignition;internal combustion engines;multi-wall carbon nanotubes;pressure measurement","ignition source;air/ethylene mixture;constant volume combustion chamber;low consumption flash camera;air/methane fuel mixture;spark ignition engines;chamber pressure measurement;combustion process images;spark assisted ignition;MWCNTs photo-ignition;air/methane mixture ignition;multiwalled carbon nanotubes;single wall carbon nanotubes;ignition agents;fuel mixtures;mass 20.0 mg;temperature 373.0 K;pressure 3.0 bar;frequency 25.0 kHz;time 1.8 s","","","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various HNT concentrations (range 0.25-3.00 mg/mL) were dispersed in custom-designed tissue-mimicking phantoms and exposed to different ultrasound frequencies (7-11 MHz) through a conventional clinically-available echographic device. Off-line analysis included the evaluation of both amplitude of backscattered ultrasound signals and image brightness. Amplitude of HNT-backscattered signals showed a linear increase with particle concentration, while image brightness enhancement was limited by logarithmic compression effects. On the other hand, backscatter amplitude showed significant increments with increasing ultrasound frequency up to 10 MHz, then showing a concentration-dependent behavior without further enhancements. Overall, the most effective response was found when a 10-MHz ultrasound frequency was employed to insonify HNTs at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. In conclusion, the present study optimized the combination of incident ultrasound frequency and HNT concentration, in order to obtain an echographic image enhancement suitable for medical applications.

However, important physical and technological issues, such as carrier transport properties and reproducible incorporation of high dopant concentrations in NW materials, remain to be addressed for enabling robust nano-devices fabrication. In this work, we show the use of a multi-probe scanning tunneling microscope for the rapid electrical characterization of free-standing GaAs NWs, without any need for post-growth sample processing and contact fabrication. In particular, 2-probe I-V measurements were performed along the axis of a single 60-nm diameter unpassivated GaAs NW, and its resistance profile determined, obtaining high (in the range of GΩ) resistance values. Due to its reduced radial dimension, the NW is expected to be completely depleted. Analysis of the NW resistance profile reveals instead, that carrier transport is mediated by the NW surface states. Finally, by using the substrate as a reference electrode and placing the other three STM-tips along the NWs, we demonstrate a 4-point probe geometry that can be used for the electrical characterization of highly doped NWs.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425344","scanning probe microscopy;III-V semiconductor nanowire;electrical resistivity;MOVPE self-assembly","Gallium arsenide;Substrates;Probes;Electrical resistance measurement;Surface resistance;Epitaxial growth","electrical resistivity;gallium arsenide;III-V semiconductors;nanofabrication;nanowires;optical constants;scanning tunnelling microscopy;self-assembly;semiconductor growth;surface conductivity;surface states;wide band gap semiconductors","surface-mediated electrical transport;III-V semiconductor compound;crystal-phase;4-point probe geometry;nanowires;self-assembly;optical properties;physical properties;multiprobe scanning tunneling microscopy;electrical resistivity;surface states;size 60 nm;GaAs","","2","","28","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A metrological characterized AFM can be used to make reproducible elasticity measurements on biological samples. In this paper a method to accurately measure a cell elasticity change based on measurement of a stable and homogeneous material is proposed. Nanoindenter characteristics (nanoindenter with pyramidal tip and triangular shape) and indentation parameters (0.1 V as approaching point, 5 um/s as indentation speed and indentation load of 0.4 V) were found feasible for all tested samples. A modal cell elastic modulus of 0.5 kPa for lung tumor cell and a limit AFM measurement reproducibility of 4% was obtained.","","978-1-5090-5151-9","10.1109/NANOFIM.2015.8425323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425323","AFM;elastic modulus;metrology;tumour cell;cancer diagnosis;Sylgard","Elasticity;Cancer;Nanobioscience;Force;Shape;Frequency measurement","atomic force microscopy;biomechanics;cancer;cellular biophysics;elastic moduli;elasticity;lung;nanoindentation;patient diagnosis;tumours","reproducible elasticity measurements;biological samples;cell elasticity change;modal cell elastic modulus;lung tumor cell;limit AFM measurement reproducibility;cancer detection;AFM metrological approach;cancer diagnosis;morphological examination;human cells;tissue samples;gold standard;metrological characterized AFM;biomarker;nanoindenter characteristics;indentation parameters;indentation speed;indentation load","","","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Railway vehicles are characterised by low rolling resistance, and high inertia, therefore the traction drives must have suitable capabilities to deliver the required vehicle performance. Both AC and DC motors are in common use in the railway sector, but have very different power delivery requirements, and there are a multitude of power conversion stages that are necessary to transfer the power from the network to the wheels of the vehicle in a smooth manner. These power converters have evolved from simple camshaft controlled mechanical switches, through to compact power electronic converters. State-of-the-art systems are able to regenerate high quality power back into both DC and AC power systems. For those routes which are uneconomic to electrify, the use of on board energy storage offers a means to improve energy efficiency, by providing a store for braking energy which can then be released during acceleration. These types of systems are currently in the development phase, but are expected to enter regular passenger service in the future. Energy storage on the wayside is also being implemented to improve the power performance of existing systems, and to improve the overall energy efficiency by improving the receptivity of the line to regenerated power.","","978-1-78561-560-3","10.1049/ic.2015.0334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8361979","","","AC motors;braking;camshafts;DC motors;energy conservation;sustainable development;traction motor drives","sustainable traction drives;railway traction system;AC motor;DC motor;simple camshaft controlled mechanical switches;compact power electronic converter;energy efficiency improvement;braking energy storage","","","","","","24 May 2018","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The NHPP is applied to estimate the warranty period after simple repairs (minimal), while GRP is used when repairs are complex (overhauls).

The lower layer models the load sharing interaction and fault propagation, and in turn calculates the deterioration rates and failure rates to be used in the upper layer.

In this paper, a health index is computed by fusing values within an indicator vector related to global system function. The fusion operator used is the Choquet integral. This requires the identification of capacities (Choquet integral parameters) for each function within the system. In this way, a bottom-up approach is introduced to infer capacities of each system function from those computed at the component level. Inference can be implemented for components/sub-systems in parallel or in series. Consistent with initial work dealing with system components implemented in parallel, the feasibility and interest of our approach are shown on a sub-system of the TELMA platform structured with three components in series.","1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/dpu006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8343879","health monitoring;health index;prognostics and health management;maintenance;data fusion;Choquet integral","","","","","","","","","23 Apr 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The architecture is based on supervision, diagnosis and prognosis modules. The considered faults are slowly evolving, gradual faults, also known as drift. The approach consists in extracting indicators for drift detection and characterization. Moreover, in many real applications, dysfunctional analysis techniques do not allow the determination of the complete list of failures that may impact a system. Our proposed architecture allows us to update this a priori analysis. The architecture is based on a dynamical clustering algorithm that allows a continuous update of the operating modes (normal and degraded) of the system. The method is applied to a case study of a tank system.","1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/dpu008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8343881","drift;condition monitoring;maintenance;prognosis;dynamical clustering;dynamical systems","","","","","","","","","23 Apr 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In particular, the single-product replenishment problem is formulated and an optimal order quantity is derived by minimizing a cost function that includes both economic and environmental costs relating to repair and replacement, including the environmental cost of the production of new parts and the disposal of used parts. The optimal means of transport, the optimal repair policy, and the corresponding optimal value of the sustainable economic order quantity (SOQ) are calculated. A numerical example derived from industrial field data is presented to test the model. Results are discussed and compared with classical EOQ model solutions. SOQ values larger than EOQ, slow means of transportation and high repair rates minimize the cost function, while fast means of transportation are identified as the optimal choice only when transport distances are short and spare parts demand is highly variable.","1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/dpu004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8343878","sustainable inventory management;SOQ;spare parts;repair policy;loss factor","","","","","","","","","23 Apr 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The pros and cons of using CAA and different question types are discussed. Issues surrounding the selection and encoding of mal-rules are highlighted, especially for multi-choice and responsive numerical input questions. These generate mal-rule-specific feedback, the mal-rule used being deduced from the student’s selection or input. Student answer file data from the use of over 800 questions and their embedding within an overall assessment regime is analysed and presented to show that this has had a very beneficial effect on the examination performance of a large cohort of first-year economics students in their mathematics module over the last 6 years. Question analysis of over 270,000 question attempts, identifying the most difficult/discriminating questions, shows that the questions are robust, valid and span an appropriate range of difficulties. The idea of underlying mal-rules is examined to see how far this explains this range.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hrv012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8151981","","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is found that the number of online summative assessments closely matches the number of submissions of written assignments, and that the marks are strongly correlated. The usage of formative quizzes was lower than that of the summative assessments, but they do seem to be appreciated by students who use them, and they are used in preparation for the summative assessments.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hrv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8151978","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Information technology is likely to be an emerging game changer in learning and teaching of mathematics, and we argue that the potential of e-learning platforms extends beyond simple drill exercises to complex problems (having several ‘right’ solutions) that are expected to improve conceptual understanding. We discuss these ideas referring to experiences and observations from a STACK-based automatic assessment system at Aalto University since 2006.

"What benefits could extension papers and admissions tests have for university mathematics applicants?","E. Darlington",NA,"Teaching Mathematics and Its Applications: International Journal of the IMA","19 Jan 2018","2015","34","4","179","193","It is well documented in both the British press and mathematics education literature that many consider A-levels (qualifications for secondary school leavers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) to be insufficient preparation for undergraduate mathematics study in the UK. A-level Mathematics and Further Mathematics are not solely intended for those wishing to go on to study undergraduate mathematics, though this is often the only mathematics study and preparation available to, and done by, most students. A number of British universities now require applicants to perform well on entrance examinations or ‘extension’ papers in addition to achieving certain grades in A-level Mathematics and, sometimes, Further Mathematics. This article outlines research which used the Mathematical Assessment Task Hierarchy (Smith et al., 1996) and builds upon the work of Darlington (2014) to describe the mathematical skills required to answer the questions in extension papers. These are then contrasted with skills required at A- and undergraduate level. Each of the three extension papers analysed (Advanced Extension Awards, Sixth Term Examination Papers and university admissions tests) were found to differ from each other, as well as from A-level and undergraduate examinations. This suggests that there are benefits for students doing such papers before university mathematics study. The advantages of doing these papers are not only for admissions tutors, who can use them as additional indicators of candidates’ aptitudes, but also for the students themselves as they gain insights into the nature of undergraduate mathematics and related further mathematical challenges.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hrv003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8152030","","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

They were given a talk on problem solving and given a rubric to follow, if they chose to do so. They were not given any formulae or procedures needed in order to resolve the problem. In theory, they possessed the knowledge to ask the right questions in order to make assumptions but, in practice, it turned out they were unable to link their a priori knowledge to resolve this problem. They were able to solve simple beam problems when given closed questions. The results show they were unable to visualize a simple bridge as an augmented beam problem and ask pertinent questions and hence formulate appropriate assumptions in order to offer resolutions.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hru031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8151790","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This is of particular interest as mature students constitute a relatively small proportion of the total student body, motivating a deeper study of the reasons for the high levels of engagement in this cohort. To this end two focus groups were conducted, consisting of those who do and do not attend the MLSC. Particular interest was paid to the motivation of students who attend and the reasons given by those who do not. The motivations of mature students were found to be multifaceted whereas the reasons for non-engagement were mostly in line with the literature.

The aim was to test and evaluate the capabilities and limitations that web-based communication provides both academically and socially. This innovation was viewed within a Vygotskian theoretical framework linked to a social constructivist facilitation of students’ learning. A survey among the students was performed in the mid-semester. The results of the analysis show that the renewal of the teaching was well received by the students in the group. However, the social learning environment suffered, since students failed to participate in the sessions created in connection with the web lecturing. Thus, the social learning context that we initially sought to strengthen was fragmented and lacked momentum as a result of the change.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hru029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8151788","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"The Man Who Counted: a collection of integrated adventures","S. Wilder; A. Lang; M. Monegan",NA; NA; NA,"Teaching Mathematics and Its Applications: International Journal of the IMA","19 Jan 2018","2015","34","2","102","114","Issues of disconnect and isolation from other disciplines seem to plague numerous subjects taught in high schools today. Although they share common roots, mathematics, natural sciences and humanities appeared to have developed rich, but separated curricula with only occasionally emphasized and seemingly weak connections between their respective contents. The absence of truly meaningful context that allows students to build connections to material they are learning often results in procedural, factual and regrettably short-term knowledge. One approach to repair the disarray within our educational structure may be by developing integrated projects that span not only across different facets of one particular subject, but across multiple disciplines as well. Most educational reforms have been strongly supporting the idea of integration of curricula, emphasizing that the noticeable lack of connections between the subjects is affecting not only mathematics, but also language arts, social studies and various other disciplines. The primary purpose of this article is to describe an integrated project that successfully merged the teaching standards of mathematics, social studies and language arts, while utilizing technology as the means to an innovative learning medium for high school students. The focus of the article is the development process of an integrated project, more specifically the obstacles that needed to be overcome for its successful completion. Through this particular example of a mathematics-based integrated project, we demonstrate how content standards of various disciplines can be effectively combined to produce a meaningful teaching and learning context.

This article uses a mixed method approach to explore lecturers’ views of the closed book examination in relation to other assessment methods, their preferences for different types of methods and the extent to which they discriminate between stronger and weaker students. A survey of staff views confirms the dominance of closed book examinations, but an accompanying interview study shows hidden complexity to this view. In particular a tension between the potential and the reality of examinations is uncovered and suggestions are made for resolving that tension.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hru024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8151539","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It analyses teachers’ ability to pay attention to detail and use their mathematical knowledge. The vast majority of teachers can be expected to have an excellent knowledge of mathematical techniques. The question examined here is whether this kind of knowledge might structure their attention in such a way that the emphasis on procedures deflects their attention from the essential details. Four groups of participant teachers from New Zealand, Hong Kong, Germany and Ukraine were given a mini-test containing seven simple mathematics questions. Most questions in the test were provocative in the sense that they looked like routine questions but in fact had some catch. The results of the test were startling—the vast majority of the participants gave incorrect answers to most questions in the test. After the test, the participants were given a short questionnaire to reflect on their performance on the test. Their responses were analysed using the theories of selective, divided and focused attention and Mason’s concept of the discipline of noticing.

While most mathematicians type mathematical documents using LaTeX, with varying levels of proficiency, students often use other options or handwrite mathematics. Here, we investigate students’ perceptions of the mathematical editor available since Word 2007. This investigation is timely as there is anecdotal evidence that mathematicians do not think that Word is capable of quality mathematical typesetting, and there have not been many studies in the literature on this topic. In this case study, we ask the following questions: Is Word a suitable tool for students to typeset mathematics? And: How does Word compare to other mathematical typesetting packages students have used? We asked master’s level students to typeset mathematics in Word and then comment on their experience, relating to the ease of use, quality of output and overall experience. We also asked the students to compare Word to other tools they may have used in the past. The results show that the current versions of Word are indeed capable of producing quality mathematical typesetting, that the learning curve is not high, and that Word should not be dismissed as a tool for typesetting mathematics. While there were concerns that editing takes longer than in other tools and that typesetting in general takes time, overall students were positively surprised by Word’s mathematical features and commented favourably.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hru020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8151536","","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Generation of long waves by an oscillating line source above a flat beach of angle ${\alpha=\pi =/2M, M \epsilon z}$: the 3-d Case","U. Ehrenmark",NA,"Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics","19 Jan 2018","2015","68","4","421","460","A problem of long-wave generation by an oscillatory line source is discussed in the context of 3-d flow over a plane beach of slope angle ${\alpha=\pi =/2M, M \epsilon z}$ extending previous 2-d work by the author with the use of a Kontorovich–Lebedev transform. The placing of the source at a zero of the classical long-wave scattering potential is known to lead to a system of trapped waves and provides a robust check on this generalised theory. The development is based on a solution to a second order source-induced inhomogeneous difference equation and leads to an extension and correction of previous work by Morris (Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. (1976), 79, 573) where a Green's function (for a reduced problem) was utilised for the case of a beach of unit gradient only. The solution provided in that work was recently deemed incomplete by the author (Appl. Math. Letters, 48, (2015), 135–142) following a parallel investigation on a discrepancy in numerical results from the well-known bench mark models of Peters and Roseau for the classical beach problem. While a full water column response requires a trigonometric factorisation, the complexity of which increases with ${M}$, surface response can be more readily calculated using an Abel-summable form of the inverse transform. Full water column analysis is restricted to the simple cases ${M = 2, M = 3}$. It is found, through the asymptotic theory in the transform space that, contrary to Morris' conjecture, there is a resonance at cut-off only for odd values of ${M}$ and this is verified through computation as wave-number approaches its critical value. Moreover, for cut-off resonance it is found that these amplitudes are directly proportional to the profile of the shortest edge wave possible (in source coordinates) for the chosen value of ${M}$. As a result, it therefore follows that cut-off resonance disappears if (for ${m\geq 3}$) the source is placed at a zero of this highest order edge wave. It is also found that the flow regime is generally of standing wave type landward of the source position, an observation which might impact on any subsequent mass transport discussions. An alternative method is also outlined in brief, based on recent work on electromagnetic scattering by a wedge shaped dielectric, here formulated to provide a numerical solution from a singular integral equation but designed to give results valid for arbitrary beach slope. The spectral function thus defined is shown to be consistent with that found in the analytic modelling for the case of unit slope. It remains to establish a robust numerical procedure which will combine appropriately discretised radiation conditions in the spectral space with an efficient means to invert the transform numerically.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbv015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8210268","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Singular integral equations with two fixed singularities and applications to fractured composites","Y. A. Antipov",NA,"Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics","19 Jan 2018","2015","68","4","461","501","A symmetric characteristic singular integral equation with two fixed singularities at the endpoints in the class of functions bounded at the ends is analysed. It reduces to a vector Hilbert problem for a half-disc and then to a vector Riemann–Hilbert problem on a real axis with a piecewise constant matrix coefficient that has two points of discontinuity. A condition of solvability and a closed-form solution to the integral equation are derived. For the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind in the right hand-side, the solution of the integral equation is expressed in terms of two non-orthogonal polynomials with associated weights. Based on this new generalised spectral relation for the singular operator with two fixed singularities an approximate solution to the complete singular integral equation is derived by recasting it as an infinite system of linear algebraic equations of the second kind. The method is illustrated by solving two problems of fracture mechanics, the antiplane and plane strain problems for a finite crack in a composite plane. The plane is formed by a strip and two half-planes; the elastic constants of the strip are different from those of the half-planes. The crack is orthogonal to the interfaces, and it is located in the strip with the ends lying in the interfaces. Numerical results are reported and discussed.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbv016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8210269","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Elastic lattices are distinguished from scalar lattices in that two or more types of coupled waves exist, even at low frequencies. Such a theory enables the determination of effective material properties at both low and high frequencies. The theoretical framework is developed for the propagation of waves through lattices of arbitrary geometry and dimension. The asymptotic approach provides a method through which the dispersive properties of lattices at frequencies near standing waves can be described; the theory accurately describes both the dispersion curves and the response of the lattice. The leading order solution is expressed as a product between the standing wave solution and the long-scale envelope functions that are eigensolutions of the homogenised partial differential equation. The general theory is supplemented by a pair of illustrative examples for two archetypal classes of two-dimensional elastic lattices. The efficiency of the asymptotic approach in accurately describing several interesting phenomena is demonstrated, including dynamic anisotropy and Dirac cones. A significant advantage of the method exposited herein is that it allows one to obtain analytical expressions for the leading order asymptotic solutions and effective material properties, even for complex systems; the methodology allows for greater physical understanding of the behaviour of the system than is usually the case for purely numerical homogenisation schemes.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbv005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8152529","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The theoretical solution of the forward problem of the Electroencephalography with an isolated dipolar source has been already derived and reported in the literature. This solution is expressed in terms of an eigenexpansion in ellipsoidal harmonics. Nevertheless, this expression was not possible to be handled effectively since no ellipsoidal harmonics of degree higher than three were available in closed forms. In order to analyze further this problem an effective algorithm has been developed, which generates the ellipsoidal harmonics of arbitrary degree and order in a numerical form. The algorithm has been compared with the known analytical eigenfunctions and the results manifested a perfect coincidence. Finally, this algorithm was used to construct a numerically stable solution of the electric potential on the surface of the head, which is generated by a single dipole of arbitrary position and orientation. The degree of ellipsoidal harmonics needed for a numerically convergent solution goes all the way up to 30.The objectives of the present work are twofold. The first objective concerns the development of a numerical algorithm that can produce Lamé functions and ellipsoidal harmonics of any finite degree. Then this algorithm is utilized to generate the electric potential on the boundary of the ellipsoidal brain-head system. This application is a direct theoretical realization of the brain imagine modality known as Electroencephalography. We demonstrate, this way, the very efficient use of our numerical algorithm for solving boundary value problems in ellipsoidal geometry.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbv002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8152526","","","","","","2","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The problem for the flow around a sphere translating and rotating in a pure shear flow is solved, from the linearity of Stokes equations, as the sum of elementary problems: a sphere held fixed in a shear flow close to a wall, a sphere translating and rotating along a wall in a fluid at rest. The creeping flow is calculated analytically using the bispherical coordinates technique that provides the fluid velocity and pressure as series. The unknown coupled infinite series of coefficients are reduced by combinations from seven to four. This simplifies the formulation compared with earlier works on the translation and rotation problems. The infinite linear system for the coefficients is then solved using an extension of Thomas algorithm that allows to calculate O(105) terms in the series. Such a high number is necessary to obtain a good accuracy at small sphere to wall gaps down to 10−5 sphere radius, in particular for a large slip on the wall. Accurate results for the force and torque on the particle are then obtained for each of the three elementary problems. On this basis, results are provided for the diffusion coefficient of a dilute suspension of freely rotating spheres parallel to a slipping wall and for the translational and rotational velocities of a freely moving sphere in a pure shear flow along such a wall. Simplified formulae are provided for application to various physical problems, like for instance the interpretation of velocity measurements at micro-scales by tracking of particles close to a hydrophobic wall.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbv001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8152525","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is proved that there exist axisymmetric structures consisting of N ≥ 2 bodies; every structure has the following properties: (i) a time-harmonic wave mode is trapped by it; (ii) some of its bodies (maybe none) are motionless, whereas the rest of the bodies (maybe none) are heaving at the same frequency as water.

In this context, the model developed here can also be viewed as a more comprehensive representation of the deformation of a couple stress material in which the separate role of surface mechanics is incorporated into the model of deformation. As an example of our theory, we consider the classical problem of a semi-infinite crack in a couple stress material and examine the contribution of the reinforcement to the stress distributions in the vicinity of the crack tip.

Here we analyse this near-singular behaviour using an established one-dimensional PDE model of the two-dimensional physical system. Working in a distinguished asympotic limit, we systematically derive a low-order differential/algebraic model for the flow when it is close to the slamming state. The shape of the channel near the constriction is determined by a balance between membrane tension and fluid inertia; this region is also the predominant site of viscous dissipation, which balances energy changes distributed along the channel. The reduced model accurately captures a set of steady solution branches and their stability and shows how slamming is strongly coupled to the properties of the rigid channel downstream of the membrane. A singularity is identified in the low-order model which may explain the violent readjustment of the flow at the end of a slamming event.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8152310","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We consider the problem of an infinite elastic isotropic substrate which contains an isotropic inhomogeneity with arbitrary shape and any loading at infinity. We characterise the integrodifferential equation as a tensor singular integral equation of second kind. We adopt a classical matrixisation procedure which provides an equivalent matrix integral equation. We compute its symbol and prove that the index is zero which means that it is of Fredholm type. Consequently, according to Noether's theory, to infer existence and uniqueness it is sufficient to prove that the corresponding homogeneous equation has the trivial solution. We prove equivalently that the homogeneous transmission problem has only the trivial solution, so uniqueness and solvability is established.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbu025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211371","","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Stability of a helicoidal surface inside a cylinder with pinned diameters","R. J. Whittaker; S. Cox",NA; NA,"Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics","19 Jan 2018","2015","68","1","23","52","A mathematical analysis is presented of the stability of a soap film with uniform surface tension when stretched between two diameters on the inside of a circular cylinder. The stability boundary is found as a critical twist angle $\theta$ between the two diameters, as a function of the aspect ratio $\ell$ of the cylinder. Numerical and asymptotic results agree well with previous numerical simulations and experiments by Cox and Jones (J. Engr. Math., 86 (2014), 1–7). Their hypothesis that the stability boundary for the multiple-vane case is identical to the single film case is confirmed. It is also shown that two distinct instability mechanisms operate. For moderate and small $\theta/\ell$, the instability is driven by the decrease in area caused by the film moving to an off-diameter position. But for larger $$\theta/\ell$$ (more twisted films), the decrease in area is dominated by an internal rearrangement of the surface. The latter mechanism is more relevant to Plateau borders in foams, and our results indicate that straight Plateau borders should be stable at any length provided the total twist is less than $\pi / \sqrt{2}$.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbu026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211372","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is usual to model the mass distribution and use time-delay observations to infer cosmological parameters, but it is naturally also possible to take the cosmological parameters as given and use time delays as constraints on the mass distribution. In this paper we develop a method of isolating what exactly those constraints are, using a principal-components analysis of ensembles of free-form mass models. We find that time delays provide tighter constraints on the distribution of matter in the very highly dense regions of the lensing clusters. We apply it to the cluster lens SDSS J1004+4112, whose rich lensing data include two time delays. We find, assuming a concordance cosmology, that the time delays constrain the central region of the cluster to be rounder and less lopsided than would be allowed by lensed images alone. This detailed information about the distribution of the matter is very useful for studying the dense regions of the galaxy clusters which are very difficult to study by direct measurements. A further time-delay measurement, which is expected, will make this system even more interesting.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211339","galaxies: clusters: individual (SDSS J1004+4112);gravitational lensing: strong","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The positive NCP dominant in the disk center-side penumbra is essentially attributed to interflow channels instead of Evershed flow channels. The stratification of magnetic field and velocity are investigated by using SIR-JUMP inversion with a one-component atmosphere, and the NCP of spectral lines in the limb-side and disk center-side of the penumbra is successfully reproduced. The inversion results show that an increased Evershed flow is associated with a strong magnetic field located in the deep photosphere. Our result does not match with the simple two-component penumbral models in which the penumbra consists of Evershed flow and interflow channels and the global NCP is attributed only to the Evershed flow channels.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211343","line: profiles;Sun: magnetic fields;Sun: photosphere;sunspots","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Because of the detection of three X-ray bursts from the source, it was identified as a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary. The results of data analyses of the MAXI GSC (Gas Slit Camera) and the Swift XRT (X-Ray Telescope) follow-up observations suggest that the spectral hardness remained unchanged during the first two weeks of the outburst. All the XRT spectra in the 0.5–10 keV band can be well explained by thermal Comptonization of multi-color disk blackbody emission. The photon index of the Comptonized component is ≈ 2, which is typical of low-mass X-ray binaries in the low/hard state. Since X-ray bursts have a maximum peak luminosity, it is possible to estimate the (maximum) distance from its observed peak flux. The peak flux of the second X-ray burst, which was observed by the GSC, is about 5 photons cm−2 s−1. By assuming a blackbody spectrum of 2.5 keV, the maximum distance to the source is estimated as 7 kpc. The position of this source is contained by the large error regions of two bright X-ray sources detected with Orbiting Solar Observatory-7 (OSO-7) in the 1970s. Besides this, no past activities at the XRT position are reported in the literature. If MAXI  J1421−613 is the same source as (one of) these, the outburst observed with MAXI may have occurred after a quiescence of 30–40 years.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211347","methods: data analysis;X-rays: bursts;X-rays: individual (MAXI J1421−613)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Doi",NA,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","19 Jan 2018","2015","67","2","15","15","Mrk 1388 has an unusual Seyfert nucleus that shows narrow emission-line components without broad emission-line ones, but shows a strong featureless continuum and strong iron-forbidden, high-ionization emission lines. The apparent coexistence of type-1/2 characteristics is potentially attributed to a heavily obscured broad-line region or to an intermediate-mass black hole with a broad-line component that is intrinsically narrower than those of typical narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. Our observation carried out by using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) reveals high-brightness radio emission in nonthermal jets emerging from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a significant radio luminosity. Furthermore, we investigate the radial profile of the host galaxy using a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image, which shows a Sérsic index suggestive of a pseudobulge. Using the VLBI and HST results which essentially are not affected by dust extinction, we apply the three individual methods to an estimate of the black hole mass and obtain three similar ones: (0.76–5.4) × 106 M⊙, 1.5 × 106 M⊙, and 4.1 × 106 M⊙. These masses are within a range that is fitted with typical NLS1 galaxies rather than with intermediate-mass black holes. Based on the estimated masses, a full width at half maximum FWHM(Hβ) of approximately 1200–1700 km s−1 should have been seen. The scenario in a heavily absorbed NLS1 nucleus can explain the peculiarities previously observed.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211332","galaxies: active;galaxies: bulges;galaxies: individual (Mrk 1388);galaxies: jets;galaxies: Seyfert;quasars: supermassive black holes;radio continuum: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We could not find any meaningful difference in the oxygen abundances between the non-giant group (Teff > 5000 K) and the red-giant group (Teff < 5000 K), which are almost consistent with each other on average (despite that both have rather large dispersions of a few tenths dex caused by insufficient data quality), though only one giant star (S 1054) appears to show an exceptionally low O abundance and thus needs a more detailed study. This result may suggest that oxygen content in the stellar envelope is hardly affected (or any changes are insignificant) by the mixing of H-burning products in the red giant phase, as far as M 67 stars of low mass (∼ 1.3 M⊙) are concerned, which is consistent with the prediction from the conventional stellar evolution theory of first dredge-up.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211341","open clusters and associations: individual (M 67);stars: abundances;stars: atmospheres;stars: evolution;stars: late-type","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The maximum fading rate exceeds 2.8 mag d−1. The duration of the long outbursts is 9–18 d, comprising 50%–60% of the recurrence time of long outbursts. We detected 0.01560–0.01562 d (22.5 min) modulations during long outbursts, which we identified as superhumps. These features indicate that ASASSN-14cc has outburst parameters very similar to the extremely unusual dwarf nova RZ LMi but with a much shorter superhump period. All the observations can be naturally understood, considering that this object is a helium analog (AM CVn-type object) of RZ LMi. The highest outburst activity among AM CVn-type objects can be understood as the high-mass transfer rate expected for the orbital period giving a condition close to the stability limit of the accretion disk.

We repeat these double-iteration processes until both the intensity and velocity profiles converge. Under this double iteration, we solve the relativistic radiative transfer equation and relativistic flows in the vertical direction, simultaneously. The flows are gradually accelerated, as the optical depth decreases towards the surface.

The disk surface brightness is ∼ 0.5–1.5 mag brighter on the western side than on the eastern side. We use an inclined annulus disk model to probe the disk geometry. The model fitting suggests that the disk has an inner hole with a radius of 86 au and an eccentricity of 0.06. The disk model also indicates that the amount of dust on the western side is 2.2 times larger than that on the eastern side. A several Jupiter-mass planet may exist at ≳ 45 au and capture grains at the Lagrangian points to open the eccentric gap. This scenario can explain both the eccentric gap and the difference in the amount of dust. In case of the stellar age of several 100 Myr, a dramatic planetesimal collision possibly causes the dust to increase in the western side.

Finally, we find that a convective envelope leads to a discontinuity of the hydrogen profile above the hydrogen burning shell.

Our main purpose was to clarify whether any significantly large (≲ 0.4–0.5 dex) O-deficit really exists in these evolved stars, which was once suspected by Takeda et al. (2008, PASJ, 60, 781) from the analysis of the [O I] 5577 line, since it (if real) cannot be explained by the current theory and may require the necessity of special non-canonical deep mixing in the envelope. We found, however, that the previous [O/H]5577 results (differential abundances relative to the Sun) were systematically underestimated compared to the more reliable [O/H]7773 (from O I 7771–5 triplet lines) or [O/H]6300 (from [O I] 6300 line) obtained in this study. Comparing the updated [O/Fe] ratios with the theoretically predicted surface abundance changes caused by mixing of nuclear-processed products dredged-up from the interior, we concluded that the oxygen deficiency in these red giants is insignificantly marginal (only by ≲ 0.1 dex), which does not contradict the expectation from the recent theoretical simulation. This consequence of reasonable consistency between theory and observation also applies to the extent of peculiarity in [C/Fe] and [Na/Fe], which were also examined by re-analyzing the previous equivalent-width data of C I 5052/5380 and Na I 6160 lines.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211342","stars: abundances;stars: atmospheres;stars: evolution;stars: late-type","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Near-infrared spectroscopy of M dwarfs. II. H2O molecule as an abundance indicator of oxygen","T. Tsuji; T. Nakajima; Y. Takeda",NA; NA; NA,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","19 Jan 2018","2015","67","2","26","26","Based on the near-infrared spectra (R ≈ 20000) of M dwarfs, oxygen abundances are determined from the rovibrational lines of H2O. Although H2O lines in M dwarfs are badly blended with each other and the continuum levels are depressed appreciably by the collective effect of the numerous H2O lines themselves, quantitative analysis of H2O lines has been carried out by referring to the pseudo-continua, consistently defined on the observed and theoretical spectra. For this purpose, the pseudo-continuum on the theoretical spectrum has been evaluated accurately by the use of the recent high-precision H2O line-list. Then, we propose a simple and flexible method of analyzing the equivalent widths (EWs) of blended features (i.e., not necessarily limited to single lines) by the use of a mini–curve-of-growth (CG), which is a small portion of the usual CG around the observed EW. The mini-CG is generated by using the theoretical EWs evaluated from the synthetic spectrum in exactly the same way as the EWs are measured from the observed spectrum. The observed EW is converted to the abundance by the use of the mini-CG, and the process is repeated for all the observed EWs line-by-line or blend-by-blend. In cool M dwarfs, almost all the oxygen atoms left after CO formation are in stable H2O molecules, which suffer little change for the uncertainties due to imperfect modelling of the photospheres. Thus the numerous H2O lines are excellent abundance indicators of oxygen. The oxygen abundances are determined to be log AO (AO = NO/NH) between −3.5 and −3.0 in 38 M dwarfs, but cannot be determined in four early M dwarfs in which H2O lines are detected only marginally. The resulting log AO/AC values plotted against log AC appear to be systematically smaller in the carbon-rich M dwarfs, showing the different formation histories of oxygen and carbon in the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk. Also, AO/AFe ratios in most M dwarfs are closer to the solar AO/AFe ratio, based on the classical high oxygen abundance rather than on the recently downward-revised low value.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211344","molecular data;stars: abundances;stars: atmospheres;stars: fundamental parameters;stars: low-mass","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here we report optical spectroscopic observations of the dust-forming nova V2676 Oph in the early phase, and we use these data in addition to spectroscopic observations reported previously to discuss the origin of diatomic molecules in the nova.

Three masks, designed to be complementary (labeled Mask-A, Mask-B, and Mask-C), were formed in 5  μm thick nickel. The design of Mask-A is based on a one-dimensional barcode mask. The design principle of Mask-B is similar, but has a smaller inner working angle and a lower contrast than Mask-A. Mask-C is based on a concentric ring mask and provides the widest dark region and a symmetric point spread function. Mask-A and Mask-C were both designed to produce a flexibly tailored dark region (i.e., non-uniform contrast). The contrast was evaluated using a light source comprising a broadband super-luminescent light-emitting diode with a center wavelength of 650 nm, and the measurements were carried out in a large vacuum chamber. Active wavefront control was not applied in this work. The coronagraphic images obtained by experiment were mostly consistent with the designs. The contrast of Mask-A within the ranges 3.3–8 λ/D and 8–12 λ/D was ∼ 10−4–10−7 and ∼ 10−7, respectively, where λ is the wavelength and D is the pupil diameter. The contrast of Mask-B was ∼ 10−4 and that of Mask-C over an extended field of view (5–25 λ/D) was ∼ 10−5–10−6. The effect of tilting the masks was investigated, and found to be irrelevant at the ∼ 10−7 contrast level. Therefore the masks can be tilted to avoid ghosting. These high-contrast free-standing masks have the potential to enable coronagraphic imaging over a wide wavelength range using both ground-based and space-borne general-purpose telescopes with pupil structures not specifically designed for coronagraphy.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211345","instrumentation: high angular resolution;planetary systems;telescopes","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The photospheric Poynting flux and coronal heating","B. T. Welsch",NA,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","19 Jan 2018","2015","67","2","18","18","Some models of coronal heating suppose that convective motions at the photosphere shuffle the footpoints of coronal magnetic fields and thereby inject sufficient magnetic energy upward to account for observed coronal and chromospheric energy losses in active regions. Using high-resolution observations of plage magnetic fields made with the Solar Optical Telescope aboard the Hinode satellite, we investigate this idea by estimating the upward transport of magnetic energy—the vertical Poynting flux, Sz—across the photosphere in a plage region. To do so, we combine the following: (i) estimates of photospheric horizontal velocities, vh, determined by local correlation tracking applied to a sequence of line-of-sight magnetic field maps from the Narrowband Filter Imager, with (ii) a vector magnetic field measurement from the SpectroPolarimeter. Plage fields are ideal observational targets for estimating energy injection by convection, because they are (i) strong enough to be measured with relatively small uncertainties, (ii) not so strong that convection is heavily suppressed (as within umbrae), and (iii) unipolar, so Sz in plage is not influenced by mixed-polarity processes (e.g., flux emergence) unrelated to heating in stable, active-region fields. In this plage region, we found that the average Sz varied in space, but was positive (upward) and sufficient to explain coronal heating, with values near (5 ± 1) × 107 erg cm−2 s−1. We find the energy input per unit magnetic flux to be on the order of 105 erg s−1 Mx−1. A comparison of intensity in a Ca II image co-registered with one plage magnetogram shows stronger spatial correlations with both total field strength and unsigned vertical field, |Bz|, than either Sz or horizontal flux density, Bh. The observed Ca II brightness enhancement, however, probably contains a strong contribution from a near-photosphere hot-wall effect, which is unrelated to heating in the solar atmosphere.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211335","magnetic fields;Sun: corona;Sun: photosphere","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The NH3(J, K) = (1, 1) and (2, 2) inversion lines were detected in absorption with the Tsukuba 32 m telescope, and the NH3(1, 1) through (6, 6) lines with the VLA, although the profile of NH3(3, 3) was in emission in contrast to the other transitions. The background continuum source, whose flux density was ∼ 50 mJy, could not be resolved with the VLA beam of ≲ 0${^{\prime\prime}_{.}}$09 × 0${^{\prime\prime}_{.}}$08. All ammonia absorption lines have two distinct velocity components: one is at the systemic velocity and the other is blueshifted, and both components are aligned along the nuclear jets. For the systemic components, the relatively low temperature gas is extended more than the high temperature gas. The blueshifted NH3(3, 3) emission can be regarded as ammonia masers associated with shocks by strong winds probably from newly formed massive stars or supernova explosions in dense clouds in the nuclear megamaser disk. Using para-NH3(1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), and (5, 5) lines with VLA, we derived the rotational temperature Trot = 120 ± 12 K and 157 ± 19 K for the systemic and blueshifted components, respectively.

The fractional abundance of NH3 relative to molecular hydrogen H2 for the systemic and blueshifted was [NH3]/[H2] = 1.3 × 10−7 and 6.5 × 10−8, respectively. We also found the F = 4–4 and F = 5–5 doublet lines of OH 2Π3/2J = 9/2 in absorption, which could be fitted by two velocity components, systemic and redshifted components.

This reconfirms the previously reported age discrepancy of this magnetar/remnant association, and suggests that the characteristic ages of magnetars are generally over-estimated as compared to their true ages. This discrepancy is thought to arise because the former are calculated without considering decay of the magnetic fields. This novel view is supported independently by much stronger Galactic-plane concentration of magnetars than other pulsars. The process of magnetic field decay in magnetars is mathematically modeled. It is implied that magnetars are much younger objects than previously considered, and can dominate new-born neutron stars.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208512","ISM: supernova remnants;stars: magnetars;stars: magnetic fields;stars: neutron;X-rays: individual (CTB 109, 1E 2259+586)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The data shows that a large amount of molecular gas is located in the central ∼ 200 pc starburst region, physically associated with two young super stellar clusters (SSCs). The molecular gas traced by 12CO(2–1) is elongated along the minor axis (dust lane) of the galaxy and its kinematics suggest that there is an inflow of molecular gas to the direction of the central SSCs, as is also observed in H I gas at a larger scale. Due to their correlation in spatial and velocity domains, the central SSCs were likely formed from molecular gas in the nucleus. We compare the 12CO(2–1) with available H2 1–0 S(1) data, and show that while the relatively cold gas traced by 12CO(2–1) is distributed around the central starburst region but also along the dust lane, the warm gas traced by H2 1–0 S(1) is associated with the central H II region and other star-forming regions. Interestingly, a cavity in the H2 1–0 S(1) emission is found to be spatially correlated with a Hα shell. This Hα shell may trace a bipolar outflow from the central SSCs and the H2 1–0 S(1) gas, the gas shocked by the outflow encountering the surrounding quiescent gas. We calculate a molecular gas inflow rate of ∼ 2 M⊙ yr−1, a star formation rate of 0.3–0.5 M⊙ yr−1, and an ionized gas outflow being emitted from the SSCs with a rate of (5–25)× 10−3 f M⊙ yr−1, where f is a volume filling factor.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208514","galaxies: individual (NGC 5253);galaxies: starburst;ISM: jets and outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It also includes detailed information about the theoretical models, for example the adopted methods and assumptions in individual models. The novelty of the database is to consider new experimental probes such as symmetry energy, its slope with respect to the baryon density, and incompressibility, which enables users to check their model dependence.

The X-ray energy spectra during the softening periods can be reproduced with a model consisting of a multi-color disk blackbody and its Comptonized component. The fraction of the Comptonized component decreased from 0.30 to 0.15 when the spectrum became softer; meanwhile the inner disk temperature (Tin) increased from 0.2 to 0.45 keV. These results imply that the softening events are triggered by a short-term increase of the mass accretion rate.

The signal-to-noise ratios of the resulting spectra are improved by a factor of up to 3.2 compared to those obtained with normal stacking analysis. We successfully detect a weak 13CO emission from the interarm region where the emission was not detected in the individual pointings. We compare the integrated intensity ratios $I_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/I_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$ among six characteristic regions (center, bar, bar-end, offset, arm, and interarm). We find that $I_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/I_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$ in the bar and interarm are higher than those in the other regions by a factor of ∼ 2 and $I_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/I_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$ in the center is moderately high. These high $I_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/I_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$ ratios in the bar and center are attributed to a high intensity ratio ($T_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/T_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$), and that in the interarm is attributed to a high ratio of the full width at half maximum of spectra (FWHM$_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/$FWHM$_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$). The difference between FWHM$_{^{12}{\rm CO}}$ and FWHM$_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$ of the interarm indicates the existence of two components, one with a narrow line width (∼ FWHM$_{\rm ^{13}CO}$) and the other with a broad line width (∼ FWHM$_{\rm ^{12}CO}$). Additionally, the $T_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/T_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$ ratio in the broad-line-width component of the interarm is higher than the other regions. The high $T_{^{12}\rm {CO}}/T_{^{13}{\rm CO}}$ in the center and bar and of the broad-line-width component in the interarm suggest the existence of non-optically thick 12CO components. We find that more than half of the 12CO emissions of the interarm are likely to be radiated from the diffuse component. Our result suggests that the use of a universal CO-to-H2 conversion factor might lead to an overestimation of molecular gas mass and underestimation of star-formation efficiency in the interarm by a factor of a few.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208507","galaxies: ISM;galaxies: structure;ISM: molecules;radio lines: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We used SOT-SP data of 558 vector magnetograms of a total of 80 active regions obtained during the period from 2006 to 2012. We have applied spatial smoothing and division of data points into weak and strong field ranges to compare the contributions from different scales and field strengths. We found that the current helicity follows the “hemispheric sign rule” when weak magnetic fields (absolute field strength < 300 gauss) are considered and no smoothing is applied. On the other hand, the pattern of current helicity fluctuates and violates the hemispheric sign rule when stronger magnetic fields are considered and smoothing of 2${^{\prime\prime}_{.}}$0 (modeled on ground-based observations) is applied. Furthermore, we found a tendency that weak and inclined fields conform to the hemispheric sign rule and strong and vertical fields violate it. These different properties of helicity through the strong and weak magnetic field components give important clues in understanding the solar dynamo as well as the mechanism of formation and evolution of solar active regions.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208509","Sun: activity;Sun: magnetic fields;sunspots","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The physical properties of these molecules and shock-related molecules, such as HNCO, CH3CN, SO, and CH3OH, detected in the 3-mm band were estimated using rotation diagrams under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. The rotational temperatures of the CO isotopic species and the shock-related molecules in the CND are, respectively, 14–22 K and upper limits of 20–40 K. Although the column densities of the CO isotopic species in the CND are only from one-fifth to one-third of that in the starburst ring, those of the shock-related molecules are enhanced by a factor of 3–10 in the CND. We also discuss the chemistry of each species, and compare the fractional abundances in the CND and starburst ring with those of Galactic sources such as cold cores, hot cores, and shocked molecular clouds in order to study the overall characteristics. We find that the abundances of shock-related molecules are more similar to abundances in hot cores and/or shocked clouds than to cold cores. The CND hosts relatively complex molecules, which are often associated with shocked molecular clouds or hot cores. Because a high X-ray flux can dissociate these molecules, they must also reside in regions shielded from X-rays.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208513","galaxies: individual (NGC 1068);galaxies: nuclei;ISM: abundances;ISM: molecules;radio lines: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Dual-band photometry revealed that the $g^{\kern1.5pt\prime} - i^{\prime}$ color reddened with a decrease in brightness during the main superoutburst and the following rebrightening phase, whereas the color became bluer with a further decrease in brightness during the slow, final decline phase. With a fit to our photometric results by a blackbody function, we estimated the disk radius ratio (ratio of the disk radius to the binary separation) and compared this with that of V455 And, a WZ Sge-type object that did not show any rebrightening in the 2007 superoutburst. The comparison revealed: (1) the disk radius ratio of EZ Lyn decreased more slowly than that of V455 And, and (2) the radius ratio of EZ Lyn at the end of the main superoutburst was larger than that of V455 And. These results favor the mass reservoir model for the mechanism of rebrightening. During both the superoutburst plateau and subsequent rebrightening phase, Hα and Hβ lines were detected. The Hα line showed a double-peak profile from which we estimated the disk radius ratio. The comparison of this ratio with that derived by photometry indicates that the Hα disk was larger than the photometric one, which suggests that the optically thin gas was extended to the outer region more than the optically thick gas disk and was possibly responsible for the rebrightening phenomenon. Time-series dual-band photometry during the main superoutburst revealed that color variations during the early superhump show roughly the same behavior as that of V455 And, whereas color variations during the ordinary superhump display clear anticorrelation with brightness, in contrast to that seen in V455 And. Here, we discuss different color behaviors.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208511","accretion disks;methods: observational;stars: dwarf novae;techniques: photometric;techniques: spectroscopic","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The resulting Vr(t) was confirmed to show the characteristic variation (Rossiter–McLaughlin effect) caused by time-varying visibility of the solar disk. By comparing the observed Vr(t) curve with the theoretical ones [which were simulated with the latitude (ψ) dependent solar rotation law ωsidereal(ψ) = A + B sin 2ψ (degree d−1)] we found that the relation B ≃ −5.5A + 77 gives the best fit, though separate determinations of A and B were not possible. Since this relationship is consistent with the real values known for the Sun (A ≃ 14.5, B ≃ −2.8), we may state that our analysis yielded satisfactory results. This consequence may provide the prospect of getting useful information on stellar rotation of eclipsing binaries from radial-velocity studies during eclipse, if many spectra of sufficiently high time-resolution are available.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208515","eclipses;line: profiles;Sun: rotation;techniques: radial velocities;techniques: spectroscopic","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The camera provides a field of view of 5${^{\prime}_{.}}$1 × 5${^{\prime}_{.}}$1 with a spatial resolution of 0${^{\prime\prime}_{.}}$298 pixel−1 in the wavelength range of 0.95 to 2.4 μm, using Offner relay optics and a PACE HAWAII-2 focal plane array. Taking advantage of the dry site, the camera is capable of narrow-band imaging observations at the hydrogen Paschen-α (Paα, λ = 1.8751 μm in air) wavelength ground-based observations of which have been quite difficult due to deep atmospheric absorption, mainly from water vapor. We have been successfully obtaining Paα images of Galactic objects and nearby galaxies since the first-light observation in 2009 with ANIR. The throughputs at the narrow-band filters (N1875, N191) including the atmospheric absorption show larger dispersion (∼ 10%) than those at broad-band filters (a few percent), indicating that they are affected by temporal fluctuations in precipitable water vapor (PWV) above the site. We evaluate the PWV content via the atmospheric transmittance at the narrow-band filters, and deduce that the median and the dispersion of the distribution of the PWV are 0.40 ± 0.30 and 0.37 ± 0.21 mm, for the N1875 and N191 data respectively, which are remarkably smaller (49% ± 38% for N1875 and 59% ± 26% for N191) than radiometry measurements at the base of Cerro Chajnantor (an altitude of 5100 m). The decrease in PWV can be explained by the altitude of the site when we assume that the vertical distribution of the water vapor is approximated at an exponential profile with scale heights within 0.3–1.9 km (previously observed values at night). We thus conclude that miniTAO/ANIR at the summit of Cerro Chajnantor indeed provides us an excellent capability for a ground-based Paα observation.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208519","atmospheric effects;infrared: general;instrumentation: detectors;site testing","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This indicates that M-dwarfs, the major component, are fewer in the halo and the thick disk. We used archived data of several surveys in both the north and south field of GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey), MODS (MOIRCS Deep Survey) in GOODS-N, and ERS (Early Release Science) and CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey) in GOODS-S. The number density of M-dwarfs in the halo has to be 20% ± 13% relative to that in the solar vicinity, in order for the detected number of stars fainter than 20.5 mag in the H band to match with the predicted value from the model. In the thick disk, the number density of M-dwarfs must be reduced (52% ± 13%) or the scale height must be decreased (∼ 600 pc). Alternatively, overall fractions of the halo and thick disks can be significantly reduced to achieve the same effect, because our sample mainly consists of faint M-dwarfs. Our results imply that the M-dwarf population in regions distant from the Galactic plane is significantly smaller than previously thought. We then discussed the implications this has on the suitability of the model predictions for the prediction of non-companion faint stars in direct imaging extrasolar planet surveys by using the best-fitting number densities.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208506","Galaxy: disk;Galaxy: halo;stars: imaging;stars: low-mass","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We also reviewed the historical development of the understanding of these objects, provided the modern criteria, and reviewed the past research in relation to superhumps, early superhumps, and the outburst mechanism. We regard the presence of early superhumps (reflecting the 2:1 resonance) and long or multiple rebrightenings as the best distinguishing properties of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. We provided the updated list of nearly 100 WZ Sge-type dwarf novae mainly based on the data obtained by the VSNET Collaboration up to Kato et al. (2015, PASJ, 67, 105), and discussed the statistics. We could detect early superhumps with amplitude larger than 0.02 mag in 63% of the studied WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, which makes early superhumps a useful distinguishing feature for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Theoretical light curves of early superhumps generally appear to reproduce the existence of many low-amplitude objects, supporting the geometrical origin of early superhumps. Using the recently developed method of measuring mass ratios using developing phase of superhumps (stage A superhumps), we showed that there is a linear relation between the period variation of superhumps and the mass ratio in WZ Sge-type objects. By using this relation, we were able to draw an evolutionary picture of a large number of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae and identified the type of outburst to be an evolutionary sequence: type C → D → A → B → E, with some outliers for type-B objects. The duration of stage A (evolutionary phase) of superhumps is also well correlated with the estimated mass ratios. By using mass ratios from stage A superhumps and the duration of stage A, we have been able to identify the best candidates for period bouncers.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202560","accretion, accretion disks;novae, cataclysmic variables;stars: dwarf novae;stars: evolution;surveys","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The relationship between the decay timescale of the disk fraction and the mass dissipation timescale of individual disks, however, remains unclear. Here we investigate the effect of the disk mass function (DMF) on the evolution of the disk fraction. We show that the time variation in the disk fraction depends on the spread of the DMF and the detection threshold of the disk. In general, the disk fraction decreases more slowly than the disk mass if a typical initial DMF and a detection threshold are assumed. We find that, if the disk mass decreases exponentially, the mass dissipation timescale of the disk can be as short as 1 Myr even when the disk fraction decreases with a time constant of ∼2.5 Myr. The decay timescale of the disk fraction can be a useful parameter to investigate the disk lifetime, but the difference between the mass dissipation of individual disks and the decrease in the disk fraction should be properly appreciated to estimate the timescale of the disk mass dissipation.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202574","protoplanetary disks;stars: protostars;stars: statistics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We study 101 solar-metallicity, 247 ultra metal-poor, and 30 zero-metal progenitors covering zero-age main sequence mass from 10.8 M⊙ to 75.0 M⊙. Using the 378 progenitors in total, we systematically investigate how the differences in the structures of these multiple progenitors impact the hydrodynamics evolution. By following a long-term evolution over 1.0 s after bounce, most of the computed models exhibit neutrino-driven revival of the stalled bounce shock at ∼200–800 ms postbounce, leading to the possibility of explosion. Pushing the boundaries of expectations in previous one-dimensional studies, our results confirm that the compactness parameter ξ that characterizes the structure of the progenitors is also a key in 2D to diagnosing the properties of neutrino-driven explosions. Models with high ξ undergo high ram pressure from the accreting matter onto the stalled shock, which affects the subsequent evolution of the shock expansion and the mass of the protoneutron star under the influence of neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion-shock instability. We show that the accretion luminosity becomes higher for models with high ξ, which makes the growth rate of the diagnostic explosion energy higher and the synthesized nickel mass bigger. We find that these explosion characteristics tend to show a monotonic increase as a function of the compactness parameter ξ.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202557","hydrodynamics;neutrinos;nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances;supernovae: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The spectra changed in shape and flux with the phase. As periastron approached, the column density of the low-energy absorption increased, which indicates that the emission from the wind–wind collision plasma was absorbed by the dense W–R wind. The spectra can be mostly fitted with two different components: a warm component with kBT = 0.3–0.6 keV and a dominant hot component with kBT ∼ 3 keV. The emission measure of the dominant, hot component is not inversely proportional to the distance between the two stars. This can be explained by the O star wind colliding before it has reached its terminal velocity, leading to a reduction in its wind momentum flux. At phases closer to periastron, we discovered a cool plasma component in a recombining phase, which is less absorbed. This component may be a relic of the wind–wind collision plasma, which was cooled down by radiation, and may represent a transitional stage in dust formation.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202576","binaries: eclipsing;stars: winds, outflows;stars: Wolf–Rayet;X-rays: individual (WR 140)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

(2009, PASJ, 61, S395), we collected times of superhump maxima for 102 SU UMa-type dwarf novae, observed mainly during the 2014–2015 season, and characterized these objects. Our project has greatly improved the statistics of the distribution of orbital periods, which is a good approximation of the distribution of cataclysmic variables at the terminal evolutionary stage, and has confirmed the presence of a period minimum at a period of 0.053 d and a period spike just above this period. The number density monotonically decreased toward the longer period and there was no strong indication of a period gap. We detected possible negative superhumps in Z Cha. It is possible that normal outbursts are also suppressed by the presence of a disk tilt in this system. There was no indication of enhanced orbital humps just preceding the superoutburst, and this result favors the thermal–tidal disk instability as the origin of superoutbursts. We detected superhumps in three AM CVn-type dwarf novae. Our observations and recent other detections suggest that 8% of objects showing dwarf nova-type outbursts are AM CVn-type objects. AM CVn-type objects and EI Psc-type objects may be more abundant than previously recognized. OT J213806, a WZ Sge-type object, exhibited remarkably different features between the 2010 and 2014 superoutbursts. Although the 2014 superoutburst was much fainter, the plateau phase was shorter than the 2010 one, and the course of the rebrightening phase was similar. This object indicates that the O − C diagrams of superhumps can indeed be variable, at least in WZ Sge-type objects. Four deeply eclipsing SU UMa-type dwarf novae (ASASSN-13cx, ASASSN-14ag, ASASSN-15bu, and NSV 4618) were identified.

We measure the gas-phase metallicity from the [N II]λ6583/Hα emission line ratio of the composite spectra in various stellar mass and star-formation rate bins. The resulting mass–metallicity relation generally agrees with previous studies obtained in a similar redshift range to that of our sample. No clear dependence of the mass–metallicity relation on star-formation rate is found. Our result at z ∼ 1.4 is roughly in agreement with the fundamental metallicity relation at z ∼ 0.1 with a fiber aperture corrected star-formation rate. We detect significant [S II]λλ6716,6731 emission lines from the composite spectra. The electron density estimated from the [S II]λλ6716,6731 line ratio ranges from 10–500 cm−3, which generally agrees with that of local galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution of our sample on [N II]λ6583/Hα vs. [S II]λλ6716,6731/Hα is different to that found locally. We estimate the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio (N/O) from the N2S2 index, and find that the N/O in galaxies at z ∼ 1.4 is significantly higher than the local values at a fixed metallicity and stellar mass. The metallicity at z ∼ 1.4 recalculated with this N/O enhancement taken into account decreases by 0.1–0.2 dex. The resulting metallicity is lower than the local fundamental metallicity relation.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202561","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The disk shows strong azimuthal asymmetry in the dust continuum emission, while gas emission is more symmetric. In this paper, we investigate how gas and dust are distributed in the dust-bright northern part of the disk and in the dust-faint southern part. We construct two axisymmetric disk models. One reproduces the radial profiles of the continuum and the velocity moments 0 and 1 of CO lines in the north, and the other reproduces those in the south. We have found that the dust is concentrated in a narrow ring of ∼50 au width (in FWHM; wd = 30 au in our parameter definition), located at ∼170–200 au from the central star. The dust particles are strongly concentrated in the north. We have found that the dust surface density contrast between the north and the south amounts to ∼70. Compared to the dust, the gas distribution is more extended in the radial direction. We find that the gas component extends at least from ∼100 au to ∼250 au from the central star, and there should also be tenuous gas remaining inside and outside of these radii. The azimuthal asymmetry of gas distribution is much smaller than dust. The gas surface density differs only by a factor of ∼3–10 between the north and south. Hence, the gas-to-dust ratio strongly depends on the location of the disk: ∼30 at the location of the peak of dust distribution in the south and ∼3 at the location of the peak of dust distribution in the north. Despite large uncertainties, we infer that the overall gas-to-dust ratio is ∼10–30, indicating that the gas depletion may already have been under way.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202575","protoplanetary disks;radiative transfer;stars: individual (HD 142527);stars: pre-main sequence;submillimeter: planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Detection of universality of dark matter profile from Subaru weak lensing measurements of 50 massive clusters","H. Niikura; M. Takada; N. Okabe; R. Martino; R.

First we demonstrate the feasibility of this method using both the analytical NFW model and simulated halos in a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations. We then apply, as a proof of concept, this method to the Subaru weak lensing data and the XMM/Chandra X-ray observables for a sample of 50 massive clusters in the redshift range 0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.3, where their halo masses differ from each other by up to a factor of 10. To estimate the NFW parameters of each cluster, we use the halo mass proxy relation of X-ray observables, based on either the hydrostatic equilibrium or the gas mass, and then infer the halo concentration from the model scaling relation of halo concentration with halo mass. We evaluate the performance of the NFW scaling analysis by measuring the scatters of 50 cluster lensing profiles relative to the NFW predictions over a range of radii, 0.14 ≤ R/[h−1 Mpc] ≤ 2.8. We found 4–6 σ-level evidence of the universal NFW profile in 50 clusters, for both the X-ray halo mass proxy relations, although the gas mass appears to be a better proxy of the underlying true mass. By comparing the measurements with the simulations of cluster lensing profiles taking into account the statistical errors of intrinsic galaxy shapes in the Subaru data, we argue that additional halo mass errors or intrinsic scatters of σ(M500c)/M500c ∼ 0.2–0.3 could reconcile the difference between measurements and simulations. This method allows us to some extent to preserve characteristics of individual clusters in the statistical weak lensing analysis, thereby yielding a new means of exploiting the underlying genuine form of the halo mass profile and the halo mass proxy relations via weak lensing information, under the assumption of the existence of the universal profile.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202570","cosmology: observations;dark matter;galaxies: clusters: general;gravitational lensing: weak","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The receiver system is designed to conduct polarization observations by taking the cross-correlation of two linearly polarized components, from which we process full Stokes spectroscopy. We aim to measure the magnetic field strength through the Zeeman effect of the emission line of CCS (JN = 43–32) toward pre-protostellar cores. A linear-polarization receiver system has a smaller contribution of instrumental polarization components to the Stokes V spectra than that of the circular polarization system, so that it is easier to obtain the Stokes V spectra. The receiver has an RF frequency of 42–46 GHz and an intermediate frequency (IF) band of 4–8 GHz. The typical noise temperature is about 50 K, and the system noise temperature ranges from 100 to 150 K over the frequency of 42–46 GHz. The receiver system is connected to two spectrometers, SAM45 and PolariS. SAM45 is a highly flexible FX-type digital spectrometer with a finest frequency resolution of 3.81 kHz. PolariS is a newly developed digital spectrometer with a finest frequency resolution of 60 Hz, and which has a capability to process the full-Stokes spectroscopy. The half-power beam width (HPBW) was measured to be 37″ at 43 GHz. The main beam efficiency of the Gaussian main beam was derived to be 0.72 at 43 GHz. The SiO maser observations show that the beam pattern is reasonably round at about 10% of the peak intensity and the side-lobe level was less than 3% of the peak intensity.

Although a shock with Mach number M ≃ 4 is expected at the outer edge of the relic from the radio observation, our temperature measurements of the intracluster medium indicate a weaker temperature difference than expected. The Mach number estimated from the temperature difference at the outer edge of the relic is M ≃ 1.5, which is significantly lower than the value estimated from the radio data even considering both statistical and systematic errors. This suggests that a diffusive shock acceleration theory in the linear test particle regime, which is commonly used to link the radio spectral index to the Mach number, is invalid for this relic. We also measured the temperature difference across the western part of the relic, where a shock with M ≃ 1.6 is suggested from the X-ray surface brightness analysis of the XMM-Newton data, and obtained consistent results in an independent way. We searched for the non-thermal inverse Compton component in the relic region and the resultant upper limit on the flux is 2.4 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 in the 0.3–10 keV band.

Morphology of the molecular gas in the bar of NGC 5430 shows minimal signs of recent interactions with our resolution. The apparent morphological remnant of the past galaxy interaction is an asymmetric spiral arm, containing more molecular gas and exhibiting higher star formation rate (SFR) surface density than the two primary arms. Rotation curve analysis suggests that NGC 5430 collided with its satellite several Gyr ago. History of star formation was constrained by using SFRs that trace different timescales (infrared, radio continuum, and Hα). The collision occurred 5–10 Myr ago, triggering a transient off-center starburst of Wolf–Rayet stars at the eastern bar end. In the past, the global SFR during the Wolf–Rayet starburst peaked at 35 M⊙ yr−1. At present, the merger-driven starburst is rapidly decaying and the current global SFR has decreased to the Galactic value. The SFR will continue to decay as suggested by the present amount of dense gas [traced by HCN(1–0)]. Nonetheless, the global SFR is still dominated by the Wolf–Rayet region rather than the circumnuclear region. Compared with other barred galaxies, the circumnuclear region exhibits a particularly low dense gas fraction, low star formation activity, and high concentration of gas. Physical properties of the molecular gas are inferred by using the large velocity gradient calculations. The initial mass ratio of NGC 5430 to its satellite is suggested to be in an intermediate ratio range of 7:1–20:1.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202567","galaxies: individual: NGC 5430;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: star formation;ISM: molecules","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Mineshige",NA; NA,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","19 Jan 2018","2015","67","6","106","106","We propose a new method for black hole spin measurement. In this method, we consider a gas blob or ring falling onto a black hole from the marginally stable orbit, keeping its initial orbital angular momentum. We calculate the gas motion and photon trajectories in the Kerr space-time and, assuming that the gas blob or ring emits monochromatic radiation, carefully examine how it is observed by a distant observer. The light curve of the orbiting gas blob is composed of many peaks because of periodic enhancement of the flux due to the gravitational lensing and beaming effects. Further, the intensity of each peak first gradually increases with time due to the focusing effect around the photon circular orbit and then rapidly decreases due to the gravitational redshift, as the gas blob approaches the event horizon. The light curve of the gas ring is equivalent to a superposition of those of the blobs with various initial orbital phases, and so it is continuous and with no peaks. The flux first gradually increases and then rapidly decays, as in the blob model. The flux variation timescale depends on the black hole spin and is independent of the inclination angle, while time-averaged frequency shift has dependence on both effects. We can thus, in principle, determine spin and inclination angle from observations. The observational implications and future issues are briefly discussed.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202558","accretion, accretion disks;black hole physics;gravitation;radiative transfer;relativistic processes","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We obtain the best-fitting model parameters and their uncertainties for each state with the χ2-minimization procedure and discuss their implications on the characteristics of jet. Similar to blazars, their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) have a two-humped structure and their non-thermal emission can be modelled with the single-zone synchrotron + inverse Compton (IC) model. For all states, the GeV γ-rays may be contributed by the external Compton (EC) emission components. The observations of Fermi are mostly located at the declining stage of the EC humps. Text < 0.5 eV in all cases (Text is the characteristic temperature of external soft photons), suggesting that their radiation zones may be usually located outside of the broad line region (BLR) and the soft photons of Compton scattering mainly come from the dust torus. Compared with the bright Fermi blazars studied by Ghisellini et al. (2014, Nature, 515, 376), the Pjet (the power of the jets) of NLS1 galaxies detected by Fermi is similar to that of the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) but a little larger than that of the BL Lac objects (BL Lacs). However, a comparison of Pr (the powers of radiations) with the FSRQs and BL Lac objects shows that NLS1 galaxies’ Pr has values comparable to BL Lac objects but lower than FSRQs in spite of having similar Pjet values and the same energy carrier (the cold protons) as the FSRQs. Observations indicate that γ-NLS1 galaxies might have lower η (efficiency of gravitational energy release) values than GeV blazars.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202578","galaxies: active;galaxies: Seyfert;gamma rays: galaxies;radiation mechanisms: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Even if only 10−4 of the total electron energy is injected as non-thermal electrons, higher luminosity can be produced compared to the pure thermal model. Thus, there is a large difference between the pure thermal model and the hybrid one. In addition, as the wind velocity becomes large, the thermal peak of the comoving spectra shifts toward the high-frequency regime, due to the relativistic Doppler effect. As the wind velocity increases, on the other hand, the thermal peak of the observed spectra shifts toward the low-frequency regime, due to the redshifted part in the far side and limb side.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202573","black hole physics;radiation mechanisms: thermal;radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;radiative transfer;relativistic processes","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the case of the optically thick spherical wind, the apparent photosphere is generally aspherical, since the wind density gradually decreases with radius. In addition, if electron scattering is important, the thermalization surface decouples with the apparent photosphere, and is located deep inside it. Furthermore, since the free–free opacity depends on frequency, the location of the thermalization surface also depends on frequency. We find that the shape of the apparent photosphere is aspherical, but does not depend on frequency so much. On the other hand, in the low-frequency regime the thermalization surface is located somewhat closely to the apparent photosphere, and its shape is aspherical, since the free–free opacity dominates the electron scattering one at low frequencies. In the high-frequency regime, however, the thermalization surface is located deep inside the flow, and its shape is nearly spherical, since the electron-scattering opacity dominates the free–free one at high frequencies. As a result, the expected spectrum becomes a multi-temperature blackbody one; the spectrum has a Wien peak, but the spectral slope below the peak is shallower than the Rayleigh–Jeans slope. This is partly due to the non-spherical shapes of the apparent photosphere and thermalization surface in some cases, but mainly because we observe a different part for different frequencies; i.e., low-frequency photons come from larger thermalization radii with lower temperatures, while high-frequency ones come from smaller thermalization radii with higher temperatures.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202562","black hole physics;opacity;radiative transfer;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Since the lifetime of dark matter halos colliding into clusters is longer than that of X-ray emitting gas halos, weak-lensing analysis is a powerful method to constrain merger dynamics. Two-dimensional shear fitting using a clean background catalog suggests that the cluster undergoes a merger with a mass ratio of about 2 : 1. The main halo is located around the gas core in the southern region, while no concentrated gas core is associated with the northern sub-halo. We find that the projected cluster mass distribution resulting from an unequal-mass merger is in excellent agreement with the curved shapes of the two radio relics and the overall X-ray morphology, except for the lack of the northern gas core.

The two sets of derived light curves show a large difference in their shape, i.e., the 2013 light curves show big asymmetry, whereas the 2014 light curve is almost symmetric. All light curves were analysed using the 2013 version of the Wilson–Devinney (W-D) code. The obtained solutions show that 1SWASP J075102.16+342405.3 is of the A subtype W UMa contact system with an extremely high fill-out of f ≈ 96% and a high mass ratio of 0.70–0.78. Furthermore, a third light contributing to the total flux of the system was found. All these properties make the system a very special short-period source. The analysis of the 2013 light curves proved that the changes in the light curve shape are caused by magnetic activities. By means of all available times of minimum light, the variation of the orbital period was studied. It was found that the O − C diagram implies an increasing orbital period over a time span of eight years, which may be caused by the mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one; however, we are more inclined to say that it is only a part of a long period cyclic variation which can be explained by the light-travel time effect (LTTE) via the third body.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202572","binaries: close;binaries: eclipsing;stars: individual (1SWASP J075102.16+342405.3)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We simulate the fallback in jet-induced explosions with two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics calculations and the jet acceleration with steady, radial, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics calculations, and derive the detailed nuclear composition of the jet by post-processing calculation. We found that if the temperature at the jet launch site is above 4.7 × 109 K, quasi-statistical equilibrium is established and heavy nuclei are dissociated into light particles such as 4He during the acceleration of the jets. The criterion for the survival of metal nuclei is written in terms of the isotropic jet luminosity as $L_{\rm j}^{\rm iso} \lesssim 3.9 \times 10^{50} ( R_{\rm i}/10^{7}\ {\rm cm})^2$(1 + σi) erg s−1, where Ri and σi are the initial radius of the jets and the initial magnetization parameter, respectively. If the jet is initially dominated by radiation field (i.e., σi ≪ 1) and the isotropic luminosity is relatively high ($L_{\rm j}^{\rm iso} >rsim 4 \times 10^{52}$ erg s−1), the metal nuclei cannot survive in the jet. On the other hand, if the jet is mainly accelerated by magnetic field (i.e., σi ≫ 1), metal nuclei initially contained in the jet can survive without serious dissociation even in the case of a high-luminosity jet. If the jet contains metal nuclei, the dominant nuclei are 28Si, 16O, and 32S and the mean mass number can be 〈A〉 ∼ 25.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202994","gamma-ray burst: general;magnetohydrodynamics (MHD);nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Relativistic radiative transfer in a moving stratus irradiated by a luminous flat source","J.

Incident radiation is aberrated and Doppler-shifted when it is received by the stratus, and emitted radiation is also aberrated and Doppler-shifted when it leaves the stratus. Considering these relativistic effects, we analytically obtain the emergent intensity as well as other radiative quantities in the purely scattering case for both infinite and finite strati. We mainly consider the frequency-integrated case, but also briefly show the frequency-dependent one. We also solve the relativistic radiative transfer equation numerically, and compare the results with the analytical solutions. In the infinite stratus, the mean intensity in the comoving and inertial frames decreases and becomes constant, as the stratus speed increases. The flux in the comoving frame decreases exponentially with the optical depth. The emergent intensity decreases as the speed increases, since the incident photons are redshifted at the bottom-side of the stratus. In the finite stratus, the mean intensity in the comoving and inertial frames quickly increases in the top-side region due to the aberrated photons. The flux in the comoving frame is positive in the range of 0 < β ≤ 0.4, while it becomes negative for β ≳ 0.5. The behavior of the emergent intensity is similar to that of the infinite case, although there is an irradiation effect caused by the aberrated photons.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202989","accretion, accretion disks;galaxies: active;radiative transfer;relativistic processes;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Eddington limit for a gaseous stratus with finite optical depth","J. Fukue",NA,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","19 Jan 2018","2015","67","3","57","57","The Eddington luminosity of a spherical source is usually defined for a uniformly extending normal plasma. We usually suppose that the gas can accrete to the central object at the sub-Eddington luminosity, while it would be blown off from the central luminous source in the super-Eddington case. We reconsider this central dogma of the Eddington limit under the radiative transfer effect for the purely scattering case, using analytical and numerical methods. For the translucent isolated gas cloud (stratus) with finite optical depth, the concept of the Eddington luminosity is drastically changed. In an heuristic way, we find that the critical condition is approximately expressed as Γ = (1 + μ* + τc)/2, where Γ (=L/LE) is the central luminosity L normalized by the Eddington luminosity LE, τc is the optical depth of the stratus, and μ* ($=\sqrt{1-R_*^2/R^2}$) is the direction cosine of the central object, R* being the radius of the central object, and R the distance from the central object. When the optical depth of the stratus is around unity, the classical Eddington limit roughly holds for the stratus; Γ ∼ 1. However, when the optical depth is greater than unity, the critical condition becomes roughly Γ ∼ τc/2, and the stratus would infall on to the central source even at the highly super-Eddington luminosity. When the optical depth is less than unity, on the other hand, the critical condition reduces to Γ ≳ (1 + μ*)/2, and the stratus could be blown off in some limited ranges, depending on μ*. This new concept of the Eddington limit for the isolated stratus could drastically change the accretion and outflow physics of highly inhomegeneous plasmas, with relevance for astrophysical jets and winds and supermassive black hole formation.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203004","accretion: accretion disks;quasars: supermassive black holes;radiative transfer;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thus there is inconsistency in the formulation of the SSPH scheme at discontinuities of the fluid density. To solve this problem, we introduce a new quantity associated with particles and the “density” of that quantity. This “density” evolves through the usual continuity equation with an additional artificial diffusion term, in order to guarantee the continuity of the “density.” We use this “density,” or pseudo-density, instead of the mass density, to formulate our SPH scheme. We call our new method SPH with smoothed pseudo-density, and we show that it is physically consistent and can handle discontinuities quite well.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202982","hydrodynamics;methods: numerical;planets and satellites: surface","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A merger of binary neutron stars is a promising candidate for such a site. In faint, or less-massive, dSph galaxies such as the Draco, a few binary neutron star mergers are expected to have occurred at most over the whole past. We have measured the chemical abundance, including Eu and Ba, of three red giants in the Draco dSph by Subaru High-Dispersion Spectrograph observation. The Eu detection for one star with [Fe/H] = −1.45 confirms a broadly constant [Eu/H] of ∼ −1.3 for stars with [Fe/H] ${\buildrel {>} \over \sim}-2$. This feature is shared by other dSphs with similar masses, i.e., the Sculptor and the Carina, and suggests that a neutron star merger is the origin of r-process elements in terms of the rarity of this event. In addition, two very metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] = −2.12 and −2.51 are found to exhibit very low Eu abundances, such as [Eu/H] < −2, with the suggestion of a sudden increase of Eu abundance by more than 0.7 dex at [Fe/H] ≈ −2.2 in the Draco dSph. The detection of Ba abundances for these stars suggests that the r-process enrichment began no later than the time when only a few percent of stars in the present-day Draco dSph were formed. Though identifying the origin of an early Eu production inside the Draco dSph should be left until more abundant data of stars with [Fe/H] ${\buildrel {<} \over \sim }$−2 in Draco, as well as other faint dSphs, become available, the implied early emergence of an Eu production event might be reconciled with the presence of extremely metal-poor stars enriched by r-process elements in the Galactic halo.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203003","early universe;nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: individual (Draco);stars: abundances","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The physical origin of the bubbles is still under debate. The leading scenarios can be divided into two categories. One is nuclear star-forming activity similar to extragalactic starburst galaxies and the other is past active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like activity of the Galactic center supermassive black hole. In this letter, we propose that metal abundance measurements will provide an important clue to probe their origin. Based on a simple spherically symmetric bubble model, we find that the generated metallicity and abundance patterns of the bubbles’ gas strongly depend on assumed star formation or AGN activities. Star formation scenarios predict higher metallicities and abundance ratios of [O/Fe] and [Ne/Fe] than AGN scenarios do because of supernovae ejecta. Furthermore, the resultant abundance depends on the gamma-ray emission process because different mass injection histories are required for the different gamma-ray emission processes due to the acceleration and cooling time scales of non-thermal particles. Future X-ray missions such as ASTRO-H and Athena will give a clue to probe the origin of the bubbles through abundance measurements with their high energy resolution instruments.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203000","Galaxy: abundances;Galaxy: center;Galaxy: halo;X-rays: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This points to a temporarily increased viscosity, possibly related to the formation of large-scale and longer persisting magnetic fields by the dynamo operation during the long superoutburst. The “mini-rebrightenings” in the early post-outburst light curve of V585 Lyr discovered by Kato and Osaki (2013, PASJ, 65, 97) in Kepler observations seem to be understandable as a small limit cycle of low-luminosity changes originating from a “wiggle” feature in the thermal equilibrium curve of the cool, optically thick disk.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202996","accretion, accretion disks;magnetic fields;stars: dwarf novae;stars: individual (WZ Sge, EG Cnc, V585 Lyr, V1504 Cyg)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Furthermore, due to electron scattering, the thermalization surface decouples with the photosphere, and is located deep inside the photosphere for scattering-dominated flows.

Although the area is much smaller than previous work dealing with weak lensing peak statistics, the number density of galaxies usable for weak lensing analysis is about twice as large. The higher galaxy number density reduces the noise in the weak lensing mass maps, and thus increases the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of peaks of the lensing signal due to massive clusters. This enables us to construct a weak lensing selected cluster sample by adopting a high threshold S/N, such that the contamination rate due to false signals is small. We find six peaks with S/N > 5. For all the peaks, previously identified clusters of galaxies are matched within a separation of 1′, demonstrating good correspondence between the peaks and clusters of galaxies. We evaluate the statistical error in the weak lensing cluster counts using mock weak lensing data generated from full-sky ray-tracing simulations, and find Npeak = 6 ± 3.1 in an effective area of 9.0 degree2. We compare the measured weak lensing cluster counts with the theoretical model prediction based on halo models and place the constraint on the Ωm–σ8 plane which is found to be consistent with currently standard ΛCDM models. It is demonstrated that the weak lensing cluster counts can place a unique constraint on the σ8–c0 plane, where c0 is the normalization of the dark matter halo mass–concentration relationship.

Although the method is very promising, the computation is quite intensive, and the amount of data is tremendous, requiring several months to reconstruct observational data of one day on a high-end computer. To accelerate image reconstruction, we parallelize the program package on a high-performance cluster. We describe parallel implementation details for several reconstruction procedures. The code is written in the C language using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and is optimized for parallel processing in a multiprocessor environment. We show the excellent performance of parallel implementation, and the whole data processing speed is about 71 times faster than before.

The basic algorithm is to calculate the line signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) along the wavelength direction, given by a 2D convolution of the spectral image and a detection kernel representing a typical emission line profile. A unique feature of FMOS is its use of OH airglow suppression masks, requiring the use of flat-field images to suppress noise around the mask regions. Bad pixels on the detectors and pixels affected by cosmic rays are efficiently removed using the information obtained from the FMOS analysis pipeline. We limit the range of acceptable line-shape parameters for the detected candidates to further improve the reliability of line detection. The final performance of line detection is tested using a subset of the FastSound data; the false detection rate of spurious objects is examined by using inverted frames obtained by exchanging object and sky frames.

For the first time, we find a tight anti-correlation between Dn(4000) and molecular gas fraction (fmol) using literature data of nearby galaxies in which the galaxies with more fuel for star formation have younger stellar populations. We find that our CO-detected galaxies at z ∼ 0.1–0.2 also follow the same relation as nearby galaxies. This implies that the galaxies evolve along this Dn(4000)–fmol relation, and that Dn(4000) seems to be able to be used as a proxy for fmol, which requires many time-consuming observations.

These 50 stars were selected from the solar-type superflare stars that we had discovered from the Kepler data. More than half (34 stars) of these 50 target superflare stars show no evidence of binarity, and we estimated stellar parameters of these 34 stars in our previous study (Notsu et al. 2015, PASJ, 67, 32). According to our previous studies using Kepler data, superflare stars show quasi-periodic brightness variations whose amplitude (0.1%–10%) is much larger than that of the solar brightness variations (0.01%–0.1%) caused by the existence of sunspots on the rotating solar surface. In this study, we investigated whether these quasi-periodic brightness variations of superflare stars are explained by the rotation of a star with fairly large starspots, by using stellar parameters derived in Paper I. First, we confirmed that the value of the projected rotational velocity, v sin i, is consistent with the rotational velocity estimated from the period of the brightness variation. Next, we measured the intensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines and Hα line, good indicators of the stellar chromospheric activity, and compared them with other stellar properties. The intensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines indicates that the mean magnetic field strength (〈fB〉) of the target superflare stars can be higher than that of the Sun. A correlation between the amplitude of the brightness variation and the intensity of Ca II triplet line was found. All the targets expected to have large starspots because of their large amplitude of the brightness variation show high chromospheric activities compared to the Sun. These results support the idea that the brightness variation of superflare stars is due to the rotation with large starspots.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202979","stars: activity;stars: flare;stars: rotation;stars: solar-type;starspots","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Because of their impulsive emission enhancements and wide distribution, they are thought to be closely related to coronal heating. By using the high-resolution 171 Å images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the lines-of-sight magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we trace 10794 microflares in a quiet region near the disk center with a field of view of 960″ × 1068″ during 24 hr. The microflares have an occurrence rate of 4.4 × 103 hr−1 extrapolated over the whole Sun. Their average brightness, size, and lifetime are 1.7I0 (of the quiet Sun), 9.6 Mm2, and 3.6 min, respectively. There exists a mutual positive correlation between the microflares’ brightness, area, and lifetime. In general, the microflares distribute uniformly across the solar disk, but form network patterns locally, which are similar to and matched with the magnetic network structures. Typical cases show that the microflares prefer to occur in magnetic cancellation regions of network boundaries. We roughly calculate the upper limit of energy flux supplied by the microflares and find that the result is still a factor of ∼ 15 below the coronal heating requirement.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202985","Sun: corona;Sun: flares;Sun: magnetic fields","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), AKARI, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) point source catalogs, we found that four sources (IRAS 19574+4941, V2494 Cyg, IRAS 22343+7501, and V583 Cas) significantly brightened at MIR wavelengths over a period of 20–30 yr, depending on an interval between two different observation epoch. Little is known about these sources except V2494 Cyg, which is considered as an FU Orionis star. Our observation clearly resolves IRAS 22343+7501 into four stars (2MASS  J22352345+7517076, 2MASS  J22352442+7517037, [RD95] C, and 2MASS  J22352497+7517113) and the first JHKs photometric data for all four sources are obtained. Two of these stars (2MASS  J22352442+7517037 and 2MASS  J22352497+7517113) are known as T Tau stars. Our spectroscopic observation reveals that IRAS 19574+4941 is an M-type evolved star and V583 Cas a carbon star. 2MASS  J22352345+7517076 is probably a young stellar object, judging from our observation showing that it has a featureless NIR spectrum and also showed dramatic brightening in NIR (about 4 mag in the Ks band). Likely reasons for dramatic brightening in MIR are discussed in this paper.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202984","circumstellar matter;infrared: stars;stars: late-type;stars: pre-main sequence","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The time-averaged X-ray spectrum cannot be described by a multi-color disk and single Compton component with its reflection, but requires additional Comptonized emissions. This double Compton component model allows a slightly larger inner radius of the multi-color disk, implying a lower spin parameter. Significant spectral evolution was observed above 8 keV along with a flux decrease on a timescale of ∼ 104–105 s.

Both observations and numerical stability analysis support that the magnetized star would have prolate and large internal toroidal magnetic fields. In this context, many investigations concerning magnetized equilibrium states have been tried to obtain the prolate and the toroidal dominant solutions, but many of them have failed to obtain such configurations. Since the Lorentz force is a cross-product of current density and magnetic field, the prolate-shaped configurations and the large toroidal magnetic fields in stars require a special relation between current density and the Lorentz force. We have analyzed simple analytical solutions and found that the prolate and the toroidal-dominant configuration require non-force-free toroidal current density that flows in the opposite direction with respect to the bulk current within the star. Such current density results in the Lorentz force which makes the stellar shape prolate. Satisfying this special relation between the current density and the Lorentz force is a key to the appearance of the prolate and the toroidal magnetic field-dominated magnetized star.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202997","stars: magnetars;stars: magnetic fields;stars: rotation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A new set of light curves and eight new observed times of light minima were derived. A total of 130 available CCD times of light minima were analyzed. The highest rate of long-term period increase in W UMa stars (+10.21 s century−1) was confirmed. The rapid period increase implies that the primary is accreting mass from the secondary at a high rate of $\skew4\dot{M} = 5.3 \times 10^{-6}\,M_{\odot }\:$yr−1. The asymmetric light curves (i.e., the O'Connell effect) were analyzed with the Wilson–Devinney Code. It was found that the spotted photometric solution with the third light is the best one for fitting the light curves. The main photometric results confirmed that LP UMa is an unusual W UMa system with a high mass ratio (q = 0.823 ± 0.003), deep-contact configuration (f = 66.6% ± 3.1%), and a temperature difference of Δ T = 700 K. The period increase in LP UMa may be a part of a long-period cyclic change because of the large third light contributions to the total system (61.52% in V, 61.39% in R, and 61.36% in I). All of these quite different properties make LP UMa a very interesting system to study.

In order to have a good prediction, the error for future data, which is called the “generalization error,” should be small. We use cross-validation in order to control the generalization error and a LASSO-type estimator in order to choose the set of variables. This approach can be used even in the case that the number of samples is smaller than the number of candidate variables. We studied the Berkeley supernova database with our approach. Candidates for the explanatory variables include normalized spectral data, variables about lines, and previously proposed flux ratios, as well as the color and light-curve widths. As a result, we confirmed the past understanding about Type Ia supernovae: (i) The absolute magnitude at maximum depends on the color and light-curve width. (ii) The light-curve width depends on the strength of Si II. Recent studies have suggested adding more variables in order to explain the absolute magnitude.

These 50 targets were selected from the solar-type (G-type main sequence) superflare stars that we had discovered from the Kepler photometric data. As a result of these spectroscopic observations, we found that more than half (34) of our 50 targets have no evidence of binary systems. We then estimated the effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]), and projected rotational velocity (vsin i) of these 34 superflare stars on the basis of our spectroscopic data. The accuracy of our estimations is higher than that of the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) values, and the differences between our values and KIC values [(ΔTeff)rms ∼ 219 K, (Δlog g)rms ∼ 0.37 dex, and (Δ[Fe/H])rms ∼ 0.46 dex] are comparable to the large uncertainties and systematic differences of KIC values reported by the previous researchers. We confirmed that the estimated Teff and log g values of the 34 superflare stars are roughly in the range of solar-type stars. In particular, these parameters and the brightness variation period (P0) of nine of the stars are in the range of “Sun-like” stars (5600 ≤ Teff ≤ 6000 K, log g ≥ 4.0, and P0 > 10 d). Five of the 34 target stars are fast rotators (vsin i ≥ 10 km s−1), while 22 stars have relatively low vsin i values (vsin i < 5 km s−1). These results suggest that stars that have spectroscopic properties similar to the Sun can have superflares, and this supports the hypothesis that the Sun might cause a superflare.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202978","stars: abundances;stars: activity;stars: flare;stars: rotation;stars: solar-type","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In 2010, the variability in the X-ray band was significant, while the optical and ultraviolet (UV) flux decreased gradually. Polarization properties also exhibited unique variability in 2010, suggesting the presence of a systematic component of polarization and magnetic field alignment for the emergence of a new polarized emission region. In contrast, in 2011 the variability in the X-ray band was smaller, and the variability in the optical and UV bands was larger, than in 2010. To explore the reasons for these differences, spectral fitting analysis was performed via simple synchrotron self-Compton modeling; the results revealed different behaviors in terms of spectral evolution between these periods, suggesting different variability mechanisms between 2010 and 2011. In 2010, the radiation was likely the result of energy injection into the emitting regions with an aligned magnetic field. In contrast, in 2011 the superposition of different emission regions may have contributed to the low degree of observed polarization. It also implies that high-energy electrons which were not accelerated to ultra-relativistic velocities were injected in 2011.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202990","BL Lacertae objects: individual (Mrk 421, Polarization);Galaxies: jets","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This hydrogen-rich matter might leave its trace in the light curves and/or spectra. In this paper, we perform radiation hydrodynamical simulations of this collision for three binary systems. As a result, we find that the emission from the shock-heated region is not as strong as in previous studies. This weak emission, however, may be a result of our underestimation of the coupling between the gas and radiation in the shock interaction. Therefore, though our results suggest that the observed early light curves of SNe Ia cannot rule out a binary system with a short separation as the progenitor system, more elaborate numerical studies will be needed to reach a fair conclusion. Alternatively, our results indicate that the feature observed in the early phase of a recent type Ia SN 2014J might result from interaction of the ejecta with a red giant companion star.

With use of the field-line angular velocity, ΩFω ≡ ΩF − ω, measured by fiducial observers living in “absolute space” circulating with ω, it is then shown that the hole's spin rate ΩH also has another side of the along-field difference of the potential gradient between the surface-at-infinity S∞ and the horizon surface SH, i.e., ΩH = ΔΩFω ≡ (ΩFω)∞ − (ΩFω)H, which gives rise to a voltage drop ΔV ∝ ΔΩFω = ΩH at the interface SN with (ΩFω)N = 0 between the outer and inner force-free domains, leading to formation of a magnetized gap under SN. The EMFs due to a pair of unipolar induction batteries, ${\cal E}_{\rm out}$ and ${\cal E}_{\rm in}$, drive currents to a pair of circuits in the two domains, and satisfy relation ${\cal E}_{\rm out}-{\cal E}_{\rm in}=\Delta V$. The eigenvalue ΩF is determined by the criticality-boundary condition in MHD wind theory in terms of ΩH, i.e., ≈ (1/2)ΩH.

The simulation reveals underlying dynamic processes that give rise to observed properties of an active prominence: invisible subsurface flows self-consistently produce the cancellation of magnetic flux observed in the photosphere, while observed but somewhat counterintuitive strong upflows are driven against gravity by enhanced gas pressure gradient force along a magnetic field line locally standing vertical. The most highlighted dynamic event, transition into an eruptive phase, occurs as a natural consequence of the self-consistent evolution of a prominence plasma interacting with a magnetic field, which is obtained by seamlessly reproducing dynamic processes involved in the formation and eruption of an active prominence.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203372","magnetohydrodynamics (MHD);Sun: filaments, prominences;Sun: magnetic fields","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The two stars are studied in the on-going and quite efficient project to search for extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars with LAMOST and Subaru. Detailed abundances or upper limits of abundances have been derived for 15 elements from Li to Eu based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) mounted in the Subaru Telescope. The abundance patterns of both UMP stars are consistent with the “normal population” among the low-metallicity stars. Both of the two program stars show carbon-enhancement without any excess of heavy neutron-capture elements, indicating that they belong to the subclass of (carbon-enhanced metal-poor) CEMP-no stars, as is the case of most UMP stars previously studied. The [Sr/Ba] ratios of both CEMP-no UMP stars are above [Sr/Ba] ∼ −0.4, suggesting the origin of the carbon-excess is not compatible with the mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch companion where the s-process has operated. Lithium abundance is measured in the newly discovered UMP star LAMOST J125346.09+075343.1, making it the second UMP turnoff star with Li detection. The Li abundance of LAMOST J125346.09+075343.1 is slightly lower than the values obtained for less metal-poor stars with similar temperatures, and provides a unique data point at [Fe/H] ∼ −4.2 to support the “meltdown” of the Li Spite plateau at extremely low metallicity. Comparison with the other two UMP and HMP (hyper metal-poor, with [Fe/H] < −5.0) turnoff stars suggests that the difference in lighter elements such as CNO and Na might cause notable difference in lithium abundances among CEMP-no stars.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203354","early universe;stars: abundances;stars: Population II","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The very short period and the Algol-type configuration make EQ UMa a very good target to challenge the formation and evolution theory of low-mass Algols. We investigated the orbital period change of EQ UMa by all available times of minimum light.

We identified 14 molecular clumps in the CO(5–4) line data. The surface density of molecular gas ($\Sigma _{\rm H_2}$) and star-formation rate (ΣSFR) of the clumps are more than three orders of magnitude higher than those found in local spiral galaxies. The clumps are placed in the “burst” sequence in the $\Sigma _{\rm H_2}$–ΣSFR plane, suggesting that z ∼ 3 molecular clumps follow the star-formation law derived for local starburst galaxies. With our gravitational lens model, the positions in the source plane are derived for the molecular clumps, dust clumps, and stellar components identified in the Hubble Space Telescope image. The molecular and dust clumps are confined within a ∼ 2 kpc region, while the spatial extent of the stellar components is as large as ∼ 6 kpc and offset toward the west. The molecular clumps have a systematic velocity gradient in the north–south direction, which may indicate a rotating gas disk. One possible scenario is that the components of molecular gas, dust, and stars are distributed in a several-kpc-scale rotating disk, and the stellar emission is heavily obscured by dust in the central star-forming region. Alternatively, SDP.81 can be explained by a merging system, where dusty starbursts occur in the region where the two galaxies collide, surrounded by tidal features traced in the stellar components.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203361","galaxies: formation;galaxies: individual (H-ATLAS J090311.6+003906, SDP.81);galaxies: ISM;gravitational lensing: strong;submillimeter: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Assuming that the redshift distribution for our DOGs sample is Gaussian, with mean and sigma z = 1.99 ± 0.45, we calculated their total IR luminosity using an empirical relation between 22 μm luminosity and total IR luminosity. The average value of the total IR luminosity is (3.5 ± 1.1) × 1013 L⊙, which classifies them as hyper-luminous infrared galaxies.

Once candidates for Galactic stars, ultra-luminous X-ray sources in a nearby galaxy, and clusters of galaxies are removed there are 896 AGN candidates in the sample. We conduct spectroscopic observations of the primary counterparts with multi-object spectrographs in the optical and NIR; 65% of the X-ray AGN candidates are spectroscopically identified. For the remaining X-ray AGN candidates, we evaluate their photometric redshift with photometric data in 15 bands. Utilizing the multi-wavelength photometric data of the large sample of X-ray-selected AGNs, we evaluate the stellar masses, M*, of the host galaxies of the narrow-line AGNs. The distribution of the stellar mass is remarkably constant from z = 0.1 to 4.0. The relation between M* and 2–10 keV luminosity can be explained with strong cosmological evolution of the relationship between the black hole mass and M*. We also evaluate the scatter of the UV–MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) of the X-ray AGNs as a function of X-ray luminosity and absorption by the nucleus. The scatter is compared with galaxies which have redshift and stellar mass distribution matched with the X-ray AGN. The UV–NIR (near-IR) SEDs of obscured X-ray AGNs are similar to those of the galaxies in the matched sample. In the NIR–MIR range, the median SEDs of X-ray AGNs are redder, but the scatter of the SEDs of the X-ray AGN broadly overlaps that of the galaxies in the matched sample.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203352","catalogs;galaxies: active;quasars: general;surveys;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By using the clumpfind algorithm we identify 114 molecular clumps in the H13CO+ data cube. The clump mass function (CMF) can be described by a power law (dN/dM ∝ M−γ, with γ ≃ 2) in the range of 5 × 103 < Mclump < 2 × 104 M⊙.

A Large Velocity Gradient model analysis with the RADEX program confirms the enhancement of SiO molecules in the shells. On the other hand, there is no such large shell with a high ratio in the Sgr A complex. A hollow hemispherical structure is found in the l–b–v data cube of the Sgr B2 complex. The central part of the structure has a high ratio (RT ≲ 8). The ratio decreases with proximity to the outer area.

We adopt the near-disk approximation, and treat the problem in the framework of special relativity, where the radiation drag force as well as the radiation pressure are included. We find that the optically thin strati are easy to accelerate, compared with the particles, and the escape condition of the stratus is reduced. That is, when the disk luminosity is around the Eddington luminosity, the optically thin strati can escape from the inner disk (≲ 20 rg; rg being the Schwarzschild radius). When the disk luminosity is about half the Eddington luminosity, it can escape at around 5 rg. This is due to the translucent effect. In addition, the trajectories of the strati are not vertical, but a funnel-like shape due to the centrifugal force. Stratus outflow could easily blow out from usual accretion disks with sub-Eddington luminosities, and this may explain outflows observed in broad absorption line quasars and ultra-fast outflow objects.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203365","accretion, accretion disks;black hole physics;galaxies: active;radiative transfer","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

(2012, ApJ, 759, 33) have shown multiple plasma ejections and the intermittent nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere, highlighting the need for fast reconnection to occur in highly collisional plasma. However, the physical process through which fast magnetic reconnection occurs in partially ionized plasma, like the solar chromosphere, is still poorly understood. It has been shown that for sufficiently high magnetic Reynolds numbers, Sweet–Parker current sheets can become unstable leading to tearing mode instability and plasmoid formation, but when dealing with a partially ionized plasma the strength of coupling between the ions and neutrals plays a fundamental role in determining the dynamics of the system. We propose that as the reconnecting current sheet thins and the tearing instability develops, plasmoid formation passes through strongly, intermediately, and weakly coupled (or decoupled) regimes, with the time scale for the tearing mode instability depending on the frictional coupling between ions and neutrals. We present calculations for the relevant time scales for fractal tearing in all three regimes. We show that as a result of the tearing mode instability and the subsequent non-linear instability due to the plasmoid-dominated reconnection, the Sweet–Parker current sheet tends to have a fractal-like structure, and when the chromospheric magnetic field is sufficiently strong the tearing instability can reach down to kinetic scales, which are hypothesized to be necessary for fast reconnection.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203366","Sun: chromosphere;Sun: magnetic fields","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Li is a key element to understand the evolution of the stellar convection zone, which reflects the age of solar-type stars. We performed the high-dispersion spectroscopy of solar-type superflare stars with Subaru/High Dispersion Spectrograph and confirmed that 34 stars show no evidence of binarity in our previous study. In this study, we derived the Li abundances of these 34 objects. We investigate correlations of Li abundance with stellar atmospheric parameters, rotational velocity, and superflare activities to understand the nature of superflare stars and the possibility of the nucleosynthesis of Li by superflares. We confirm the large dispersion in the Li abundance, and the correlation with stellar parameters is not seen. When compared with the Li abundance in the Hyades cluster, which is younger than the Sun, it is suggested that half of the observed stars are younger than Hyades cluster. The measured value of v sin i (projected rotational velocity) supports that those objects are younger than the Sun. However, there are some objects which show the low Li abundance and slowly rotate on the basis of the estimated v sin i and P (period of brightness variation). This result indicates that superflare stars are not only young stars but also old stars like our Sun. In our observations, we could not find any evidence of Li production by superflares.

Four sources (4U 1636−536, 4U 1705−44, 4U 1608−52, and GS 1826−238) exhibited small-amplitude X-ray variabilities with spectral state transitions. Such “mini-outbursts” were characterized by smaller amplitudes (several times) and shorter duration (less than several tens of days) than those of “normal outbursts.” A theoretical model of disk instability by Mineshige and Osaki (PASJ, 37, 1, 1985) predicts both large-amplitude outbursts and small-amplitude variabilities. We interpret the normal outbursts as the former prediction of this model, and the mini-outbursts as the latter. Here, we can also call the mini-outburst a “purr-type outburst” referring to the theoretical work. We suggest that similar variabilities lasting for several tens of days without spectral state transitions, which are often observed in the hard state, may be repeats of mini-outbursts.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203360","accretion, accretion disks;stars: neutron;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Angular (Projected) separations of the binaries are greater than 2″ (∼ 280 au), which enables us to perform spatially resolved photometry of individual primary and secondary sources. The measured occurrence of infrared excess suggests that binarity plays a role in the evolution of circumstellar disks, even at such wide binary separations. Most of the binaries have excess emission from both the circumprimary and circumsecondary disks, or show photospheric levels for both components at all four wavelengths of IRAC. On the other hand, four binary systems ($17^{+11}_{-8}$%, designated by “mixed” systems) exhibit the excess emission from a single binary component. This ratio is significantly smaller than that predicted by the random pairing of single stars, suggesting that circumprimary and circumsecondary disks are synchronously dispersed. In addition, the excess frequencies (EFs) of primary and secondary sources with a projected distance of ap ≃ 280–450 au are $100^{+0}_{-17}$% and $91^{+8}_{-18}$%, respectively, and significantly higher than that of single stars (70% ± 5%). We made a simple model describing the EF distribution as a function of the disk outer radius, Rout. Comparisons with observations using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test show that the observational data are consistent with the model when the EF ≃ 100% region is found at Rout ∼ 30–100 au. This disk radius is smaller than that typically estimated for single stars. The high EF of circumstellar disks with these radii may indicate a prolonged lifetime of dust in binary systems, possibly because the smaller disks counteract mass loss by photoevaporation.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203371","binaries: general;circumstellar matter;infrared: stars;stars: pre-main sequence","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our sample includes 4485 DRGs with (J − K)AB > 1.16 and KAB < 23.4 mag, and 132 DRGs have HST/WFC3 morphological measurements. The results of nonparametric measurements of DRG morphology are consistent with our rest-frame UVJ color classification; quiescent DRGs are generally compact while star-forming DRGs tend to have extended structures. We find the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass of star-forming DRGs present tight “main sequence” relations in all redshift bins. Moreover, the specific SFR (sSFR) of DRGs increases with redshift in all stellar mass bins and DRGs with higher stellar masses generally have lower sSFRs, which indicates that galaxies were much more active on average in the past, and star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low-mass galaxies than to high-mass galaxies. The infrared-derived SFR dominates the total SFR of DRGs which occupy the high-mass range, implying that the J − K color criterion effectively selects massive and dusty galaxies. DRGs with higher M* generally have redder (U − V)rest colors, and the (U − V)rest colors of DRGs become bluer at higher redshifts, suggesting high-mass galaxies have higher internal dust extinctions or older stellar ages and they evolve with time. Finally, we find that DRGs have different overlap among extremely red objects, BzK galaxies, IRAC-selected extremely red objects, and high-z ultraluminous infrared galaxies, indicating that DRGs are not a special population and they can also be selected by other color criteria.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203359","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The accretion flow on the lower Σ branch of the N-shape is optically thick, advection-dominated accretion flow, while that on the upper one is neutrino-dominated accretion flow. The middle branch has a negative slope on the Σ–$\skew{3}\dot{M}$ plane, meaning that the flow on this branch is secularly unstable. To investigate how the instability affects the flow structure and what observable signatures are produced, we study the time evolution of the unstable hyperaccretion flow in response to variable mass injection rates by solving the height-averaged equations for viscous accretion flows. When a transition occurs from the lower branch to the upper branch (or from the upper branch to the lower branch), the surface density rapidly increases (decreases) around that transition region, which induces locally enhanced mass flow (referred to as non-steady mass flow) into (out of) that region. We confirm that the non-steady flow can create a kind of disturbance and that it propagates over the whole disk. However, the non-steady mass flow is not strong enough to induce coherent transition over the whole disk, unless the mass injection rate varies with time. When the injection rate continuously changes, the neutrino luminosity varies intermittently, thus producing step-function-like light curves, as the radiation efficiency discontinuously changes every time the local transition occurs. The effects of changing the N-shape and possible observational consequences on the gamma-ray burst emission are briefly discussed.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203370","accretion, accretion disks;black hole physics;gamma-ray burst: general;neutrinos","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The survey started in 2012 March, and all the observations were completed in 2014 July. In total, we achieved 121 pointings of FMOS (each pointing has a 30′ diameter circular footprint) covering 20.6 deg2 by tiling the four fields of the CFHTLS Wide in a hexagonal pattern.

The properties of the SiO, H2O, and OH masers of this object are consistent with those of mass-losing evolved stars, but some other properties are difficult to explain in the standard scheme of stellar evolution in its late stage. Interestingly, a tentative detection of radio methanol lines was suggested toward this object by a previous observation. To date, there are no confirmed detections of methanol emission towards evolved stars, so investigation of this possible detection is important to better understand the circumstellar physical/chemical environment of IRAS 19312+1950. In this study, we systematically observed multiple methanol lines of IRAS 19312+1950 in the λ = 3 mm, 7 mm, and 13 mm bands, and detected six lines including four thermal lines and two class I maser lines. We derived basic physical parameters, including kinetic temperature and relative abundances, by fitting a radiative transfer model. According to the derived excitation temperature and line profiles, a spherically expanding outflow lying at the center of the nebulosity is excluded from the possibilities for methanol emission regions. The detection of class I methanol maser emission suggests that a shock region is involved in the system of IRAS 19312+1950. If the central star of IRAS 19312+1950 is an evolved star as suggested in the past, the class I maser detected in the present observation is the first case detected in an interaction region between an evolved star outflow and ambient molecular gas.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203364","masers;radio lines: stars;stars: individual (IRAS 19312+1950);stars: late-type;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One galaxy shows higher central mass concentration and has a longer and stronger bar than the other at z = 0. The stronger bar evolves by transferring its angular momentum mainly to the dark halo. Consequently the rotation speed of the bar decreases with time, while the amplitude of the bar increases with time. These features qualitatively agree with the results obtained by idealized simulations. The pattern speed of the stronger bar largely goes up and down within a half revolution in its early evolutionary stage. These oscillations occur when the bar is misaligned with the m = 4 Fourier component. These oscillations correlate with the oscillations in the triaxiality of the dark matter halo, but differently from the way identified by idealized simulations. The amplitude of the weaker bar does not increase despite the fact that its rotation slows down with time. This result contradicts what is expected from idealized simulations and is caused by the decline of the central density associated with the mass loss and feedback from the stellar populations. The amplitude of the weaker bar is further weakened by the angular momentum injection from interactions with stellar clumps in the disk. In the both galaxies, the bars are terminated around the 4:1 resonance.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203114","cosmology: theory;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: structure;methods: numerical","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It consists of two X-ray extended humps at the northwest and the southeast separated by 14′ (∼ 1.2 Mpc), and an X-ray bright bridgelike structure in between. With Suzaku, the south east hump was shown to have a temperature of 5.6 ± 0.2 keV and the northwest one 4.6 ± 0.2 keV. Neither hump exhibits significant central cool components. The bridge region has a temperature higher than 9 keV at the maximum, and this hot region is distributed almost perpendicular to the bridge axis, in agreement with the shock heating seen in numerical simulations at an early phase of a head-on major merger. This resemblance is supported by good positional coincidence between the X-ray peaks and cD galaxies associated with each cluster. In a short exposure XMM-Newton image, a significant intensity jump was found at a position where the Suzaku-measured temperature exhibits a steep gradient. These properties indicate the presence of a shock discontinuity. The Mach number is estimated to be 1.32 ± 0.22 from the temperature difference across the identified shock front, which gives a colliding velocity of approximately 1800 km s−1. From optical redshifts of the member galaxies, the two clusters are indicated to be merging nearly on the sky plane.

The detailed morphology of the lensed multiple images of the z = 3.042 infrared-luminous galaxy, which is found to consist of tens of ≲ 100 pc-sized star-forming clumps embedded in a ∼ 2 kpc disk, are well reproduced by a lensing galaxy modeled by an isothermal ellipsoid with a 400 pc core. The core radius is consistent with that of the visible stellar light, and the mass-to-light ratio of ${\sim}\,2\,M_{\odot }\,L_{\odot }^{-1}$ is comparable to the locally measured value, suggesting that the inner 1 kpc region is dominated by luminous matter. The position of the predicted mass centroid is consistent to within ≃ 30 mas with a non-thermal source detected with ALMA, which likely traces an active galactic nucleus of the foreground elliptical galaxy. While the black hole mass and the core radius of the elliptical galaxy are degenerate, a point source mass of > 3 × 108 M⊙ mimicking a supermassive black hole is required to explain the non-detection of a central image of the background galaxy. The required mass is consistent with the prediction from the well-known correlation between black hole mass and host velocity dispersion.

After removing contamination from point-like X-ray sources detected with Chandra and subtracting the X-ray and non-X-ray backgrounds, the Suzaku spectrum from the lobe was reproduced by a power-law model with a photon index of $\Gamma = 2.23_{-0.38-0.12}^{+0.44+0.14}$, where the first and second errors represent the statistical and systematic ones, respectively. Within the errors, the X-ray index was consistent with the radio synchrotron one, ΓR = 1.74 ± 0.07, estimated in the 326–2695 MHz range. This agreement supports that the X-ray emission is attributed to the inverse-Compton radiation from the synchrotron electrons filling the lobe, where the cosmic microwave background photons are up-scattered. This result made 3C 236 the largest radio galaxy of which the lobe has ever been probed through the inverse-Compton X-ray photons. When the photon index was fixed at ΓR, the X-ray flux density at 1 keV was measured as SX = 12.3 ± 2.0 ± 1.9 nJy. A comparison of the X-ray flux to the radio one (SR = 1.11 ± 0.02 Jy at 608.5 MHz) yields the energy densities of the electrons and magnetic field in the west lobe as $u_{\rm e} = 3.9_{-0.7 -0.9}^{+0.6 +1.0} \times 10^{-14}$ erg cm−3 and $u_{\rm m} = 0.92_{-0.15 -0.35}^{+0.21 +0.52}\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm−3, respectively, indicating a mild electron dominance of $u_{\rm e}/u_{\rm m} = 4.2_{-1.3 -2.3}^{+1.6 +4.1}$. The latter corresponds to the magnetic field strength of $B = 0.48_{-0.04 -0.10}^{+0.05 +0.12}\ \mu$G. These are typical among the lobes of giant radio galaxies.

The angular size of the outflow, where the radial velocity (vr) exceeds the escape velocity (vesc), increases with an increase of the distance from the black hole. As a result, the mass is blown away with speed of vr > vesc in all directions except for in the vicinity of the equatorial plane, θ = 0°–85°, where θ is the polar angle. The mass ejected from the outer boundary per unit time by the outflow is larger than the mass accretion rate onto the black hole, ∼ 150 LEdd/c2, where LEdd and c are the Eddington luminosity and the speed of light. The kinetic power of such wide-angle high-velocity outflow is comparable to the photon luminosity and is a few times larger than the Eddington luminosity. This corresponds to ∼ 1039–1040 erg s−1 for the stellar mass black holes.

Ohsuga",NA; NA,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","19 Jan 2018","2015","67","4","60","60","By performing 2.5-dimensional special relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we study super-critical accretion disks and the outflows launched via the radiation force. We find that the outflow is accelerated by the radiation flux force, but the radiation drag force prevents the outflow velocity from increasing. The outflow velocity saturates around 30%–40% of the light speed around the rotation axis, since then the flux force balances with the drag force. Our simulations show that the outflow velocity is kept nearly constant in the region of $\skew4\dot{M}_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{2-3}L_{\rm Edd}/c^{\,2}$, where $\skew4\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ is the mass accretion rate, LEdd is the Eddington luminosity, and c is the light speed. Such a faster outflow is surrounded by a slower outflow of ∼ 0.1c. This velocity is also determined by the balance between the radiation flux force and the radiation drag. The radiation drag works to collimate the slower outflow in cooperation with the Lorentz force, although the faster outflow is mainly collimated by the Lorentz force. The kinetic energy is carried by the slower outflow rather than by the faster outflow. The total kinetic luminosity of the outflow as well as the photon luminosity is ∼ LEdd, almost independent of the mass accretion rate.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203109","accretion, accretion disks;black hole physics;magnetohydrodynamics (MHD);radiation: dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We apply the Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses to the simulated sample sources to determine the dynamical parameter of the models. We show that one can successfully determine the initial model parameters if astrometric results are obtained for a few hundred sources with currently achieved astrometric accuracy. If astrometric data are available from 500 sources, the expected accuracy of R0 and Θ0 is ∼ 1% or higher, and parameters related to the spiral structure can be constrained by an error of 10% or with higher accuracy. We also show that the parameter determination accuracy is basically independent of the locations of resonances such as corotation and/or inner/outer Lindblad resonances. We also discuss the possibility of model selection based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and demonstrate that BIC can be used to discriminate different dynamical models of the Galaxy.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203120","astrometry;Galaxy: fundamental parameters;Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The result is consistent with the previous result of 5.32$^{+0.49}_{-0.42}\:$kpc obtained by Choi et al. (2014, ApJ, 790, 99) within error. To remove the effect of internal maser motions (e.g., random motions), we observed six maser features associated with IRAS 07427−2400 and determined systematic proper motions of the source by averaging proper motions of the six maser features. The obtained proper motions are (μαcos δ, μδ) = (−1.79 ± 0.32, 2.60 ± 0.17) mas yr−1 in equatorial coordinates, while Choi et al. (2014) showed (μαcos δ, μδ) = (−2.43 ± 0.02, 2.49 ± 0.09) mas yr−1 with one maser feature. Our astrometry results place the source in the Perseus arm, the nearest main arm in the Milky Way. Using our result with previous astrometry results obtained from observations of the Perseus arm, we conducted direct (quantitative) comparisons between 27 astrometry results and an analytic gas dynamics model based on the density-wave theory, obtaining two results. First is the pitch angle of the Perseus arm determined by VLBI astrometry, 11 $_{.}^{\circ}$1 ± 1 $_{.}^{\circ}$4, differing from what is determined by the spiral potential model (probably traced by stars), ∼ 20°. The second is an offset between a dense gas region and the bottom of the spiral potential model.

Both of them are plausible candidates for the origins of the cosmic MeV gamma-ray background. If the cosmic MeV gamma-ray background radiation is dominated by non-thermal emission from Seyferts, a sensitivity of 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 is required to detect several hundred Seyferts in the entire sky. If FSRQs make up the cosmic MeV gamma-ray background, a sensitivity of ∼ 4 × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 is required to detect several hundred FSRQs following the recent FSRQ X-ray luminosity function.

These 12 outbursts, together with those in the 1970s, were all found to recur with a well-defined period of 132.189 ± 0.02 d, which can be identified with the orbital period. The pulse period of ∼ 275 s, obtained from the RXTE/PCA and Fermi/GBM data, apparently exhibited a periodic modulation synchronized with the outburst period, suggesting the pulsar orbital motion, which is superposed on a secular spin-up trend throughout the entire active phase. The observed pulse period changes were successfully represented by a model composed of the binary orbital modulation and pulsar spin up caused by mass accretion through an accretion disk.

"Formation of young massive clusters from turbulent molecular clouds","M. S. Fujii",NA,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan","19 Jan 2018","2015","67","4","59","59","Young massive clusters are as young as open clusters but more massive and compact compared with typical open clusters. The formation process of young massive clusters is still unclear, and it is an open question whether the formation process is the same for typical open clusters or not. We perform a series of N-body simulations starting from initial conditions constructed from the results of hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds. In our simulations, both open clusters and young massive clusters form when we assume a density-dependent star-formation efficiency. We find that a local star-formation efficiency higher than 50% is necessary for the formation of young massive clusters, but open clusters form from less dense regions with a local star formation efficiency of < 50%. We confirm that the young massive clusters formed in our simulations have mass, size, and density profile similar to those of observed young massive clusters such as NGC 3603 and Trumpler 14. We also find that these simulated clusters evolve via hierarchical mergers of sub-clusters within a few mega years, as is suggested by recent simulations and observations. Although we do not assume initial mass segregation, we observe that the simulated massive clusters show a shallower slope of the mass function (Γ ∼ −1) in the cluster center compared to that of the entire cluster (Γ ∼ −1.3). These values are consistent with those of some young massive clusters in the Milky Way such as Westerlund 1 and Arches.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psu137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203107","galaxies: star clusters: general;methods: numerical;open clusters and associations: general;open clusters and associations: individual (Arches, NGC 3603, Trumpler 14, Westerlund 1, Westerlund 2)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The destruction of the fan-spine topology owing to the interaction between its magnetic fields and a nearby emerging flux region (EFR) is observed for the first time. The line-of-sight magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the SDO reveal that the dome is located on the mixed magnetic fields, with its rim rooted in the redundant positive polarity surrounding the minority parasitic negative fields. The fan surface of the dome consists of a filament system and recurring jets are observed along its spine. The jet occurring around 13:54 UT is accompanied by a quasi-circular ribbon that brightens in the clockwise direction along the bottom rim of the dome, which may indicate an occurrence of slipping reconnection in the fan-spine topology. The EFR emerges continuously and meets with the magnetic fields of the dome. Magnetic cancellations take place between the emerging negative polarity and the outer positive polarity of the dome's fields, which lead to the rise of the loop connecting the EFR and brightenings related to the dome. A single Gaussian fit to the profiles of the IRIS Si IV 1394 Å line is used in the analysis. It appears that there are two rising components along the slit, in addition to the rise in the line-of-sight direction. The cancellation process repeats again and again. Eventually the fan-spine dome is destroyed and a new connectivity is formed. We suggest that magnetic reconnection between the EFR and the magnetic fields of the fan-spine dome is responsible for the destruction of the dome.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203122","magnetic reconnection;Sun: activity;Sun: chromosphere;Sun: corona;Sun: transition region","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Although the quasi-stationary density wave theory supposes that spirals are rigidly rotating, long-lived patterns, the dynamic spiral theory predicts that spirals are differentially rotating, transient, recurrent patterns. In order to distinguish between the two spiral models from observations, we performed hydrodynamic simulations with steady and dynamic spiral models. Hydrodynamic simulations in steady spiral models demonstrated that the dust lane locations relative to the stellar spiral arms (hereafter, arm–gas offsets) depend on radius, regardless of the strength and pitch angle of the spiral and the model of the interstellar medium. In contrast, we found that the dynamic spiral models show no systematic radial dependence of the arm–gas offsets. The arm–gas offset radial profile method, together with the other test methods, will help us to distinguish between the two spiral models in observed spiral galaxies.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psv048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8203123","galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: spiral;ISM: kinematics and dynamics;methods: numerical","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, by using a flat broad-line region (BLR) structure, we study the location and properties of the γ-ray-emitting region of 4C +21.35 under the constraints of multiwavelength data. We fit three quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions using a homogeneous one-zone leptonic model, in which a flat BLR with aperture angle α = 25° and a spherically symmetric hot dusty torus with a temperature of Tsub = 1200 K are assumed. The results show that the jet structure of 4C +21.35 is nearly conical with a half-opening angle of θj ≃ 0 $_{.}^{\circ}$29–0 $_{.}^{\circ}$6. Furthermore, the emitting region is located within the BLR clouds and approaches the outer radius of the BLR during the flaring states, while it is well beyond the dusty torus in quiescent state. The quiescent high-energy emission is dominated by the synchrotron self-Compton process, the high-energy emission during the flaring periods is dominated by Compton scattering of BLR and dusty torus photons with a value of the Compton-dominance parameter of about 30.

The range of answers that have been proposed in the literature are surveyed and criticised. I argue that there is good reason to reject both the view that pluralities never form sets and the view that pluralities always form sets. Instead, we need to affirm restricted set formation. Casting doubt on the availability of any informative principle which will settle which pluralities form sets, the paper concludes by affirming a naturalistic approach to the philosophy of set theory.","1744-6406","","10.1093/philmat/nkv010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8207335","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Rescorla",NA,"Philosophia Mathematica","19 Jan 2018","2015","23","3","338","366","Turing computation over a non-linguistic domain presupposes a notation for the domain. Accordingly, computability theory studies notations for various non-linguistic domains. It illuminates how different ways of representing a domain support different finite mechanical procedures over that domain. Formal definitions and theorems yield a principled classification of notations based upon their computational properties. To understand computability theory, we must recognize that representation is a key target of mathematical inquiry. We must also recognize that computability theory is an intensional enterprise: it studies entities as represented in certain ways, rather than entities detached from any means of representing them.","1744-6406","","10.1093/philmat/nkv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8207334","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

An important rule for the treatment of identity in HoTT is path induction, which is commonly explained by appeal to the homotopy interpretation of the theory's types, tokens, and identities as (respectively) spaces, points, and paths. However, if HoTT is to be an autonomous foundation then such an interpretation cannot play a fundamental role. In this paper we give a derivation of path induction, motivated from pre-mathematical considerations, without recourse to homotopy theory.","1744-6406","","10.1093/philmat/nkv014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8207338","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

An argument due to Dedekind then proves that structures (1) and structures (2) are isomorphic. Consequently, first- and second-order statements true in structures (1) must hold in (2), and conversely.

I argue that even though Frege's applicability argument is not a version of IA, it facilitates acceptance of suitable formulations of IA. The prospects for making the empiricist IA compatible with a rationalist Fregean framework appear thus much less dim than expected. Nonetheless, those arguing for such compatibility eventually face an hardly surmountable dilemma.","1744-6406","","10.1093/philmat/nkt046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8207885","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In contrast, French mathematicians had a less structural, more problem-oriented approach to mathematics and did not speak of depth so readily.","1744-6406","","10.1093/philmat/nku035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157135","","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This theorem has been judged deep by many mathematicians, and so makes for a good case on which to focus in analyzing mathematical depth.

"Azimuthally symmetric theory of gravitation – II. On the perihelion precession of solar planetary orbits","G. G. Nyambuya",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","3034","3043","This paper presents an improved version of the azimuthally symmetric theory of gravitation (ASTG) model, which was presented for the first time in the present journal in 2010. I propose a solution to the standing problem of the λ-parameters and, in order to do this, I put the ASTG model on a clear pedestal for falsification. As in the first paper, the perihelion precessional data of solar planetary orbits is used to set the theory into motion. It is seen that the ASGT model is able to explain the anomalous perihelion precession that is explained by the general theory of relativity (GTR) as being a result of space–time curvature. The ASTG model explains that the anomalous perihelion precession is not a result of the curvature of space–time, as is the case with the GTR, but a result of the spin of the gravitating mass about which these test bodies orbit. In this way, the ASTG model provides a plausible alternative way to interpret the observed anomalous perihelion precession of solar planetary orbits.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201210","celestial mechanics;ephemerides;Planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The spectral regions covered include the H2 S(1)–S(3), [Ne II], [Ne III] emission lines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. We estimate the total warm H2 mass and the kinetic energy of the outflowing warm molecular gas to be between Mwarm ∼ 5 and 17 × 106 M⊙ and EK ∼ 6 and 20 × 1053 erg. Using the ratios of the 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3 μm PAH features in the IRS spectra, we are able to estimate the average size and ionization state of the small grains in the superwind. There are large variations in the PAH flux ratios throughout the outflow. The 11.3/7.7 and the 6.2/7.7 PAH ratios both vary by more than a factor of 5 across the wind region. The northern part of the wind has a significant population of PAH's with smaller 6.2/7.7 ratios than either the starburst disc or the southern wind, indicating that on average, PAH emitters are larger and more ionized. The warm molecular gas to PAH flux ratios (H2/PAH) are enhanced in the outflow by factors of 10–100 as compared to the starburst disc. This enhancement in the H2/PAH ratio does not seem to follow the ionization of the atomic gas (as measured with the [Ne III]/[Ne II] line flux ratio) in the outflow. This suggests that much of the warm H2 in the outflow is excited by shocks. The observed H2 line intensities can be reproduced with low-velocity shocks (v < 40 km s−1) driven into moderately dense molecular gas (102 < nH < 104 cm−3) entrained in the outflow.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201211","galaxies: individual: M82;galaxies: starburst;infrared: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The universal character of this mapping also allows us to introduce a simple, yet general, method for the validation of Bayesian posterior distributions of any dimensionality. This new approach goes beyond validating software implementations; it provides a sensitive test for all assumptions, explicit or implicit, that underlie the inference. In particular, the method assesses whether the inferred posterior distribution is a truthful representation of the actual constraints on the model parameters. We illustrate our multidimensional K–S test by applying it to a simple two-dimensional Gaussian toy problem, and demonstrate our method for posterior validation in the real-world astrophysical application of estimating the physical parameters of galaxy clusters parameters from their Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in microwave background data. In the latter example, we show that the method can validate the entire Bayesian inference process across a varied population of objects for which the derived posteriors are different in each case.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201214","methods: data analysis;methods: statistical;galaxies: clusters: general;cosmology: observations","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To understand the nature and the origin of such outer spiral structure, we investigate the propagation in the outer gaseous disc of large-scale spiral waves excited in the bright optical disc. Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that non-axisymmetric density waves, penetrating in the gas through the outer Lindblad resonance, can exhibit relatively regular spiral structures outside the bright optical stellar disc. For low-amplitude structures, the results of numerical simulations match the predictions of a simple WKB linear theory. The amplitude of spiral structure increases rapidly with radius. Beyond ≈2 optical radii, spirals become non-linear (the linear theory becomes quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate) and unstable. In numerical simulations, in models for which gas is available very far out, spiral arms can extend out to 25 disc scalelengths. A comparison between the properties of the models we have investigated and the observed properties of individual galaxies may shed light into the problem of the amount and distribution of dark matter in the outer halo.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201241","galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: spiral;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

From the apertures we tested, we find that velocity dispersions measured within a circular aperture with radius equal to one effective radius minimizes the intrinsic scatter of the Fundamental Plane. Using simple yet powerful Jeans dynamical models, we determine dynamical masses for our galaxies. Replacing luminosity in the Fundamental Plane with dynamical mass, we demonstrate that the resulting Mass Plane has further reduced scatter, consistent with zero intrinsic scatter.

We perform an independent analysis of the CFHTLenS six bin tomography results of Heymans et al. We extend their systematics treatment and find the cosmological constraints to be relatively robust to the choice of non-linear modelling, extension to the intrinsic alignment model and inclusion of baryons. We find that when marginalized in the Ωm–σ8 plane, the 95 per cent confidence contours of CFHTLenS and Planck+WMAP only just touch, but the discrepancy is less significant in the full six-dimensional parameter space of Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM). Allowing a massive active neutrino or tensor modes does not significantly resolve the tension in the full n-dimensional parameter space. Our results differ from some in the literature because we use the full tomographic information in the weak lensing data and marginalize over systematics. We note that adding a sterile neutrino to ΛCDM brings the 2D marginalized contours into greater overlap, mainly due to the extra effective number of neutrino species, which we find to be 0.88 ± 0.43 (68 per cent) greater than standard on combining the data sets. We discuss why this is not a completely satisfactory resolution, leaving open the possibility of other new physics or observational systematics as contributing factors.

The disc relative thickness z0/h in the near- and mid-infrared passbands correlates weakly with morphological type and does not correlate with the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio B/T in all studied bands. Applying a 1D photometric profile analysis overestimates the disc thickness in galaxies with large bulges making an illusion of the relationship between the disc flattening and the ratio B/T. In our sample, the early-type disc galaxies (S0/a) have both flat and ‘puffed’ discs. The early spirals and intermediate-type galaxies have a large scatter of the disc flatness, which can be caused by the presence of a bar: barred galaxies have thicker stellar discs, on average. On the other hand, the late-type spirals are mostly thin galaxies, whereas irregular galaxies have puffed stellar discs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201207","galaxies: statistics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This study focuses on IRAS 19135+3937, an SRd variable with an infrared excess indicative of a dusty disc. A time series of high-resolution spectra, UBV photometry as well as a very accurate light curve obtained by the Kepler satellite, allowed us to study the object in unprecedented detail. We discovered it to be a binary with a period of 127 d. The primary has a low surface gravity and an atmosphere depleted in refractory elements. This combination of properties unambiguously places IRAS 19135+3937 in the subclass of post-asymptotic giant branch stars with dusty discs. We show that the light variations in this object cannot be due to pulsations, but are likely caused by the obscuration of the primary by the circumbinary disc during orbital motion. Furthermore, we argue that the double-peaked Fe emission lines provide evidence for the existence of a gaseous circumbinary Keplerian disc inside the dusty disc. A secondary set of absorption lines has been detected near light minimum, which we attribute to the reflected spectrum of the primary on the disc wall, which segregates due to the different Doppler shift. This corroborates the recent finding that reflection in the optical by this type of discs is very efficient. The system also shows a variable H α profile indicating a collimated outflow originating around the companion. IRAS 19135+3937 thus encompasses all the major emergent trends about evolved disc systems, that will eventually help to place these objects in the evolutionary context.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201215","stars: AGB and post-AGB;binaries: spectroscopic;circumstellar matter;stars: variables: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The effect of cloud structure, radiative cooling and ionizing radiation from the progenitor stars on the net input of kinetic energy, fkin = Ekin/ESN, thermal energy, ftherm = Etherm/ESN, and gas momentum, fP = P/PSN, to the interstellar medium (ISM) is tested. For clouds with $\bar{n} = 100\;{\rm cm}^{-3}$, the momentum generating Sedov and pressure-driven snowplough phases are terminated early (∝0.01 Myr) and radiative cooling limits the coupling to ftherm ∼ 0.01, fkin ∼ 0.05, and fP ∼ 9, significantly lower than for the case without cooling. For pre-ionized clouds, these numbers are only increased by ∼50 per cent, independent of the cloud structure. This only suffices to accelerate ∼5 per cent of the cloud to radial velocities ≳30 km s−1. A second SN might enhance the coupling efficiencies if delayed past the Sedov phase of the first explosion. Such very low coupling efficiencies cast doubts on many subresolution models for SN feedback, which are, in general, validated a posteriori. Ionizing radiation appears not to significantly enhance the coupling of SNe to the surrounding gas as it drives the ISM into inert dense shells and cold clumps, a process which is unresolved in galaxy-scale simulations. Our results indicate that the momentum input of SNe in ionized, structured clouds is larger (more than a factor of 10) than the corresponding momentum yield of the progenitor's stellar winds.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201245","methods: numerical;ISM: bubbles;H II regions;ISM: structure;ISM: supernova remnants","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Chugunov",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","2772","2779","Rezzolla et al. drew attention to the second-order secular drift associated with r-modes and claimed that it should lead to enhancement of the magnetic field and suppression of r-mode instability in magnetized neutron stars. We critically revise these results. We present a particular second-order r-mode solution with vanishing secular drift, thus refuting a widely believed statement that secular drift is an unavoidable feature of r-modes. This non-drifting solution is not affected by a magnetic field B, if B ≪ Bcrit ≈ 1017 (ν/600 Hz) G (ν is the spin frequency) and does not lead to secular evolution of the magnetic field. For a general second-order r-mode solution, the drift does not necessarily vanish. The solution can be presented as a superposition of two solutions: one describes the evolution of differential rotation of a non-oscillating star (secular drift; for an unmagnetized star it is an arbitrary stationary rotation stratified on cylinders; for a magnetized star differential rotation evolves on the Alfvén timescale and may lead to enhancement of the magnetic energy), and the other is the non-drifting r-mode solution mentioned above. This representation allows us to conclude that enhancement of the magnetic field energy is limited by the initial energy of differential rotation, which is much less than the total energy of the r-mode (by a factor ∝ α2, where α is the mode amplitude). Hence, enhancement of the magnetic field by drift cannot suppress the r-mode instability. The results can be generalized for any oscillation mode in any medium, if this mode has a non-drifting solution for B = 0.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201208","dynamo;MHD;stars: neutron;stars: oscillations","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We employ Monte Carlo simulations to derive a simple population model for the intrinsic unbeamed luminosities and the Lorentz Γ of blazar jets that adequately describe the observed redshift and apparent superluminal speed distributions for flux-limited blazar samples. We derive separate models for BL Lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). We then use these models to compute the predicted distribution of Doppler factors in each blazar class, and address the following questions: (a) What is the relativistically induced spread in observed time-scales (e.g. event duration, time lags) in a flux-limited sample of relativistic jets? (b) Could differences between BL Lacs and FSRQs observed in the time domain be attributed to differences in beaming between the two populations? (c) Is there a statistically preferred amount of beaming in a flux-limited sample? How large are statistical deviations from that preferred value?

In this paper, we present a test of the scaling relation for the global asteroseismic parameter νmax, the frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest observed pulsation amplitude. The classic relation assumes that this characteristic frequency scales with a particular combination of surface gravity and effective temperature that also describes the dependence of the cut-off frequency for acoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere, i.e. $\nu _{\rm max} \propto gT_{\rm eff}^{-1/2}$. We test how well the oscillations of cool main-sequence and subgiant stars adhere to this relation, using a sample of asteroseismic targets observed by the NASA Kepler Mission. Our results, which come from a grid-based analysis, rule out departures from the classic $gT_{\rm eff}^{-1/2}$ scaling dependence at the level of ≃1.5 per cent over the full ≃ 1560 K range in Teff that we tested. There is some uncertainty over the absolute calibration of the scaling.

However, the spectroscopic diagnoses are providing us with useful constraints on the presence of blended stellar contaminants. In this paper, we present how a contaminating star affects the measurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as a function of the parameters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implemented into the PASTIS planet-validation software. We find particular cases for which a blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation. It might also produce a bisector variation anticorrelated with the radial velocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. In those cases, the full width at half-maximum variation provides complementary constraints. These results can be used to constrain blend scenarios for transiting planet candidates or radial velocity planets. We review all the spectroscopic diagnoses reported in the literature so far, especially the ones to monitor the line asymmetry. We estimate their uncertainty and compare their sensitivity to blends. Based on that, we recommend the use of BiGauss which is the most sensitive diagnosis to monitor line-profile asymmetry. In this paper, we also investigate the sensitivity of the radial velocities to constrain blend scenarios and develop a formalism to estimate the level of dilution of a blended signal. Finally, we apply our blend model to re-analyse the spectroscopic diagnoses of HD 16702, an unresolved face-on binary which exhibits bisector variations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201205","methods: data analysis;techniques: radial velocities;techniques: spectroscopic;binaries: spectroscopic;planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have extracted the far-infrared (FIR) counterparts of 3493 IRDCs with known distance in the Galactic longitude range 15° ≤ l ≤ 55° and searched for the young clumps using Herschel infrared Galactic plane survey, the survey of the Galactic plane carried out with the Herschel satellite. Each clump is identified as a compact source detected at 160, 250 and 350 μm. The clumps have been classified as protostellar or starless, based on their emission (or lack of emission) at 70 μm. We identify 1723 clumps, 1056 (61 per cent) of which are protostellar and 667 (39 per cent) starless. These clumps are found within 764 different IRDCs, 375 (49 per cent) of which are only associated with protostellar clumps, 178 (23 per cent) only with starless clumps, and 211 (28 per cent) with both categories of clumps. The clumps have a median mass of ∼250 M⊙ and range up to >104 M⊙ in mass and up to 105 L⊙ in luminosity. The mass–radius distribution shows that almost 30 per cent of the starless clumps identified in this survey could form high-mass stars; however these massive clumps are confined in only ≃4 per cent of the IRDCs. Assuming a minimum mass surface density threshold for the formation of high-mass stars, the comparison of the numbers of massive starless clumps and those already containing embedded sources suggests an upper limit lifetime for the starless phase of ∼105 yr for clumps with a mass M > 500 M⊙.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201247","catalogues;stars: formation;stars: massive;ISM: clouds;Galaxy: stellar content;infrared: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Pebbles and asteroids are susceptible to strong accelerations from the intense luminosity and winds of GB stars. Here, we establish equations that can model time-varying GB stellar radiation, wind drag and mass-loss. We derive the complete three-dimensional equations of motion in orbital elements due to (1) the Epstein and Stokes regimes of stellar wind drag, (2) Poynting–Robertson drag, and (3) the Yarkovsky drift with seasonal and diurnal components. We prove through averaging that the potential secular eccentricity and inclination excitation due to Yarkovsky drift can exceed that from Poynting–Robertson drag and radiation pressure by at least three orders of magnitude, possibly flinging asteroids which survive YORP spin-up into a widely dispersed cloud around the resulting white dwarf. The GB Yarkovsky effect alone may change an asteroid's orbital eccentricity by 10 per cent in just 1 Myr. Damping perturbations from stellar wind drag can be just as extreme, but are strongly dependent on the highly uncertain local gas density and mean free path length. We conclude that GB radiative and wind effects must be considered when modelling the post-main-sequence evolution of bodies smaller than about 1000 km.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201193","Kuiper belt: general;minor planets, asteroids: general;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;stars: AGB and post-AGB;stars: evolution;white dwarfs","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The mass limits implied by the geodesic HF QPO models are compared to those obtained due to the model of string loop oscillations around a stable equilibrium position. Assuming the whole range of the black hole dimensionless spin, 0 < a < 1, the restrictions on the black hole mass related to the twin HF QPOs are widely extended and strongly model dependent; nevertheless, they give the lower limit $M_{\rm M82\text{ }X\text{-}1} > 130 \, \mathrm {M}_{{\odot}}$ confirming existence of an intermediate black hole in the M82 X-1 source.

"Structure formation with suppressed small-scale perturbations","A. Schneider",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","3117","3130","All commonly considered dark matter scenarios are based on hypothetical particles with small but non-zero thermal velocities and tiny interaction cross-sections. A generic consequence of these attributes is the suppression of small-scale matter perturbations either due to free-streaming or due to interactions with the primordial plasma. The suppression scale can vary over many orders of magnitude depending on particle candidate and production mechanism in the early Universe. While non-linear structure formation has been explored in great detail well above the suppression scale, the range around suppressed perturbations is still poorly understood. In this paper, we study structure formation in the regime of suppressed perturbations using both analytical techniques and numerical simulations. We develop simple and theoretically motivated recipes for the halo mass function, the expected number of satellites, and the halo concentrations, which are designed to work for power spectra with suppression at arbitrary scale and of arbitrary shape. As case studies, we explore warm and mixed dark matter scenarios where effects are most distinctive. Additionally, we examine the standard dark matter scenario based on weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) and compare it to pure cold dark matter with zero primordial temperature. We find that our analytically motivated recipes are in good agreement with simulations for all investigated dark matter scenarios, and we therefore conclude that they can be used for generic cases with arbitrarily suppressed small-scale perturbations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201250","cosmology: theory;dark matter;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The argument is based on the time lag between an AGN central engine switching on and becoming visible in X-rays, and the time the AGN then requires to photoionize a large fraction of the host galaxy. Based on the typical light travel time across massive galaxies, and the observed fraction of X-ray-selected AGN without AGN-photoionized narrow lines, we estimate that the AGN phase typically lasts ∼105 yr. This lifetime is short compared to the total growth time of 107–109 yr estimated from e.g. the Soltan argument and implies that black holes grow via many such short bursts and that AGN therefore ‘flicker’ on and off. We discuss some consequences of this flickering behaviour for AGN feedback and the analogy of X-ray binaries and AGN lifecycles.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201232","galaxies: active;quasars: general;galaxies: Seyfert","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation, leading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed mass–metallicity relation and stellar mass–halo mass relation at z ∼ 3. This is achieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: (i) the different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting radial momentum expected at each stage, (ii) the realistic time delay of SNe is required to disperse very dense gas before a runaway collapse sets in, and (iii) a non-uniform density distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM) is taken into account below the computational grid scale for the cell in which an SN explodes. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback model shows strong outflows, which carry approximately 10 times larger mass than star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity. Although the metallicity of the outflow depends sensitively on the feedback model used, we find that the accretion rate and metallicity of the cold flow around the virial radius is impervious to SN feedback. Our results suggest that understanding the structure of the turbulent ISM may be crucial to assess the role of SN and other feedback processes in galaxy formation theory.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201260","galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Axion dark matter, solitons and the cusp–core problem","D. J. E. Marsh; A. Pop",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","2479","2492","Self-gravitating bosonic fields can support stable and localized (solitonic) field configurations. Such solitons should be ubiquitous in models of axion dark matter, with their characteristic mass and size depending on some inverse power of the axion mass, ma. Using a scaling symmetry and the uncertainty principle, the soliton core size can be related to the central density and axion mass in a universal way. Solitons have a constant central density due to pressure support, unlike the cuspy profile of cold dark matter (CDM). Consequently, solitons composed of ultralight axions (ULAs) may resolve the ‘cusp–core’ problem of CDM. In dark matter (DM) haloes, thermodynamics will lead to a CDM-like Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile at large radii, with a central soliton core at small radii. Using Monte Carlo techniques to explore the possible density profiles of this form, a fit to stellar kinematical data of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is performed. The data favour cores, and show no preference concerning the NFW part of the halo. In order for ULAs to resolve the cusp–core problem (without recourse to baryon feedback, or other astrophysical effects) the axion mass must satisfy ma < 1.1 × 10−22 eV at 95 per cent C.L. However, ULAs with ma ≲ 1 × 10−22 eV are in some tension with cosmological structure formation. An axion solution to the cusp–core problem thus makes novel predictions for future measurements of the epoch of reionization. On the other hand, improved measurements of structure formation could soon impose a Catch 22 on axion/scalar field DM, similar to the case of warm DM.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201195","elementary particles;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: haloes;cosmology: theory;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Capture of planets into mean-motion resonances and the origins of extrasolar orbital architectures","K. Batygin",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","2589","2609","The early stages of dynamical evolution of planetary systems are often shaped by dissipative processes that drive orbital migration. In multi-planet systems, convergent amassing of orbits inevitably leads to encounters with rational period ratios, which may result in establishment of mean-motion resonances. The success or failure of resonant capture yields exceedingly different subsequent evolutions, and thus plays a central role in determining the ensuing orbital architecture of planetary systems. In this work, we employ an integrable Hamiltonian formalism for first order planetary resonances that allows both secondary bodies to have finite masses and eccentricities, and construct a comprehensive theory for resonant capture. Particularly, we derive conditions under which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic regime, and provide a generalized criterion for guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure for calculating capture probabilities when capture is not certain. Subsequently, we utilize the developed analytical model to examine the evolution of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula, and investigate the origins of the dominantly non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian extrasolar planets. Our calculations show that the commonly observed extrasolar orbital structure can be understood if planet pairs encounter mean-motion commensurabilities on slightly eccentric (e ∼ 0.02) orbits. Accordingly, we speculate that resonant capture among low-mass planets is typically rendered unsuccessful due to subtle axial asymmetries inherent to the global structure of protoplanetary discs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201198","methods: analytical;celestial mechanics;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use the L(Hβ)–σ distance estimator based on the correlation between the ionized gas velocity dispersions and Balmer emission line luminosities of H II galaxies and Giant H II regions to trace the expansion of the Universe up to z ∼ 2.33. This approach provides an independent constraint on the equation of state of dark energy and its possible evolution with look-back time. Here we present high-dispersion (8000 to 10 000 resolution) spectroscopy of H II galaxies at redshifts between 0.6 and 2.33, obtained at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) using XShooter. Using six of these H II galaxies we obtain broad constraints on the plane Ωm–w0. The addition of 19 high-z H II galaxies from the literature improves the constraints and highlights the need for high-quality emission line profiles, fluxes and reddening corrections. The 25 high-z H II galaxies plus our local compilation of 107 H II galaxies up to z = 0.16 were used to impose further constraints. Our results are consistent with recent studies, although weaker due to the as yet small sample and low quality of the literature data of high-z H II galaxies.

"A model of cometary outbursts: a new simple approach to the classical question","P. Gronkowski; M. Wesołowski",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","3068","3077","Cometary outbursts, i.e. a sudden increase in brightness, have aroused astronomers’ curiosity since the 1920s (Hughes). In 1927, Comet 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann 1 was discovered, probably at the maximum of one of its outbursts. Many authors have tried to explain the source of cometary outbursts. They formed various models and hypotheses, but none of them have been definitely confirmed and generally accepted. In the present article, we propose a new model for the outburst activity of comets. This model is based on an idea of Ipatov & A'Hearn. This idea is a conclusion from the analysis of time variations in velocity of particles ejected from Comet 9P/Tempel after collision with the Deep Impact impactor. According to this, there are large cavities a few metres below the surface of comet nuclei. These cavities contain material under high gas pressure. In suitable conditions, the surface layers over the cavities can be thrown away and the deeper layers of the nucleus exposed. Finally, an outburst of the comet may be observed. The possible scenario in terms of outbursts is given. The amplitude of the jump in comet luminosity is also calculated. Numerical simulations were carried out for a wide range of cometary physical parameters, which are suitable for comets belonging to the class of Jupiter-family comets. They provide values of jumps in comet brightness that are consistent with those observed during the outbursts of many comets.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201224","comets: general;comets: individual: Jupiter family","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We put an upper limit on the luminosity of the central compact object of 4.02 × 1033 erg s−1.

According to previous multiwavelength observations, we divide our sample into two groups: massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and H II regions. The most detected lines are N2H+ (J = 1 − 0), HCO+ (J = 1 − 0), HNC (J = 1 − 0), HCN (J = 1 − 0), HC3N (J = 10 − 9), H13CO+ (J = 1 − 0), C2H (N = 1 − 0) and SiO (J = 2 − 1), indicating that most EGOs are indeed associated with dense clumps and recent outflow activities. The velocity widths of the N2H+ (J = 1 − 0), H13CO+ (J = 1 − 0), C2H (N = 1 − 0) and HC3N (J = 10 − 9) lines are comparable to each other in MYSOs. However, in H II regions the velocity widths of the N2H+ (J = 1 − 0) and C2H (N = 1 − 0) lines tend to be narrower than those of H13CO+ (J = 1 − 0) and HC3N (J = 10 − 9). Our results seem to support that N2H+ and C2H emissions mainly come from the gas inside quiescent clumps. In addition, we also find that the [N2H+]/[H13CO+] and [C2H]/[H13CO+] relative abundance ratios decrease from MYSOs to H II regions. These results suggest depletion of N2H+ and C2H in the late stages of massive-star formation, probably caused by the formation of H II regions inside. N2H+ and C2H might be used as chemical clocks for massive-star formation by comparing with other molecules such as H13CO+ and HC3N.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201197","stars: formation;ISM: abundances;ISM: clouds;ISM: molecules","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The resulting surface brightness (SB) profiles of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) match well to observations. On average, stars formed in galaxies accreted by the BCG account for ≳90 per cent of its total mass (the remainder is formed in situ). In circular BCG-centred apertures, the superposition of multiple debris clouds (each ≳10 per cent of the total BCG mass) from different progenitors can result in an extensive outer diffuse component, qualitatively similar to a ‘cD envelope'. These clouds typically originate from tidal stripping at z ≲ 1 and comprise both streams and the extended envelopes of other massive galaxies in the cluster. Stars at very low SB contribute a significant fraction of the total cluster stellar mass budget: in the central 1 Mpc2 of a z ∼ 0.15 cluster imaged at SDSS-like resolution, our fiducial model predicts 80–95 per cent of stellar mass below a SB of μV ∼ 26.5 mag arcsec−2 is associated with accreted stars in the envelope of the BCG.

We follow the evolution of a pair of neighbouring high-redshift mini-haloes with high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES combined with the non-equilibrium chemistry package KROME. The first collapsing mini-halo is assumed to enrich the central nuclear star cluster (NSC) of the other to a critical metallicity, sufficient for Population II (Pop. II) star formation at redshift z ≈ 27. Using the spatial configuration of the flattened, asymmetrical gas cloud forming in the core of the metal-enriched halo, we set the initial conditions for simulations of an initially non-spherical star cluster with the direct summation code NBODY6 which are compared to about 2000 NBODY6 simulations of spherical star clusters for a wide range of star cluster parameters. The final mass of the VMS that forms depends strongly on the initial mass and initial central density of the NSC. For the initial central densities suggested by our RAMSES simulations, VMSs with mass >400 M⊙ can form in clusters with stellar masses of ≈104 M⊙, and this can increase to well over 1000 M⊙ for more massive and denser clusters. The high probability we find for forming a VMS in these mini-haloes at such an early cosmic time makes collisional runaway of Pop. II star clusters a promising channel for producing large numbers of high-redshift IMBHs that may act as the seeds of supermassive black holes.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201194","galaxies: high-redshift;quasars: supermassive black holes;galaxies: star clusters: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We derive star formation rates and stellar masses for group members and discuss their position relative to the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Despite the existence of tidal features within the galaxy groups, we do not find any indication for enhanced star formation in the selected sample of HCGs. We study azimuthally averaged Hα profiles of the galaxy discs and compare them with the g′ and r′ surface brightness profiles. We do not find any truncated galaxy discs but reveal that more massive galaxies show a higher light concentration in Hα than less massive ones. We also see that galaxies that show a high light concentration in r′, show a systematic higher light concentration in Hα.

We find a good fit to both the shape and normalization of the SFRDF at z = 4–7, apart from a slight underprediction at the low-SFR end at z = 4. Likewise, we find a good fit to the faint number counts for the observed UVLF at brighter magnitudes our predictions lie below the observations, increasingly so at higher redshifts. At all redshifts and magnitudes, the raw (unattenuated) number counts for the UVLF lie above the observations. Because of the good agreement with the SFR we interpret our underprediction as an overestimate of the amount of dust in the model for the brightest galaxies, especially at high redshift. While the shape of our GSMF matches that of the observations, we lie between (conflicting) observations at z = 4–5, and underpredict at z = 6–7. The sSFRs of our model galaxies show the observed trend of increasing normalization with redshift, but do not reproduce the observed mass dependence. Overall, we conclude that the latest version of L-GALAXIES, which is tuned to match observations at z ≤ 3, does a fair job of reproducing the observed properties of galaxies at z ≥ 4. More work needs to be done on understanding observational bias at high redshift, and upon the dust model, before strong conclusions can be drawn on how to interpret remaining discrepancies between the model and observations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201265","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: luminosity function, mass function;ultraviolet: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We analyse an optimized energy range (3.2–5.3 keV) that is relatively free of instrumental features, and a plasma emission model incorporating the abundances of elements with the strongest expected emission lines at these energies (S, Ar, Ca) as free parameters. For the Perseus Cluster core, employing this model, we find evidence for an additional emission feature at an energy $E=3.51^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ keV with a flux of $2.87_{-0.38}^{+0.33}\times 10^{-7}\,{\rm photons}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}\,{\rm arcmin}^{-2}$.

The properties of these features are broadly consistent with previous claims, although the radial variation of the line strength appears in tension with dark matter (DM) decay model predictions. Assuming a decaying DM origin for these features allows us to predict the energies and detected line fluxes for the other clusters. We do not detect an emission feature at the predicted energy and line flux in the Coma, Virgo and Ophiuchus clusters. The formal 99.5 per cent upper limits on the line strengths in each cluster are well below the decaying DM model predictions, disfavouring a decaying DM interpretation. The results of further analysis suggest that systematic effects associated with modelling the spectra for the Perseus Cluster, details of the assumed ionization balance and errors in the predicted spectral line emissivities may be largely responsible for the ∼3.55 keV feature.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201238","line: identification;neutrinos;galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using an analytical model, we show that the fallback disc outflows produce blue UV-optical transients with a peak bolometric luminosity of ∼ 1042-43 erg s− 1 (peak R-band absolute AB magnitudes of −16 to −18) and an emission duration of ∼ a few to ∼10 d.

Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and Very Large Telescope spectroscopy, we have detected hydrogen and 11 metals in the atmosphere of the white dwarf. The origin of these metals is almost certainly the circumstellar disc of dusty and gaseous debris from a tidally disrupted planetesimal, accreting at a rate of 1.6 × 1010 g s−1. Studying the chemical abundances of the accreted material demonstrates that the planetesimal had a composition similar to the Earth, dominated by rocky silicates and metallic iron, with a low water content. The mass of metals within the convection zone of the white dwarf corresponds to an asteroid of at least ∼130–170 km in diameter, although the presence of ongoing accretion from the debris disc implies that the planetesimal was probably larger than this. While a previous abundance study of the accreted material has shown an anomalously high mass fraction of carbon (15 per cent) compared to the bulk Earth, our independent analysis results in a carbon abundance of just 2.5 per cent. Enhanced abundances of core material (Fe, Ni) suggest that the accreted object may have lost a portion of its mantle, possibly due to stellar wind stripping in the asymptotic giant branch.

Martinez",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","2524","2535","We introduce a new methodology to robustly determine the mass profile, as well as the overall distribution, of Local Group satellite galaxies. Specifically, we employ a statistical multilevel modelling technique, Bayesian hierarchical modelling, to simultaneously constrain the properties of individual Local Group Milky Way satellite galaxies and the characteristics of the Milky Way satellite population. We show that this methodology reduces the uncertainty in individual dwarf galaxy mass measurements up to a factor of a few for the faintest galaxies. We find that the distribution of Milky Way satellites inferred by this analysis, with the exception of the apparent lack of high-mass haloes, is consistent with the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) paradigm. In particular, we find that both the measured relationship between the maximum circular velocity and the radius at this velocity, as well as the inferred relationship between the mass within 300 pc and luminosity, match the values predicted by ΛCDM simulations for haloes with maximum circular velocities below 20 km s−1. Perhaps more striking is that this analysis seems to suggest a more cusped ‘average’ halo shape that is shared by these galaxies. While this study reconciles many of the observed properties of the Milky Way satellite distribution with that of ΛCDM simulations, we find that there is still a deficit of satellites with maximum circular velocities of 20–40 km s−1.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201268","methods: statistical;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;Local Group;galaxies: statistics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Hopkins",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","3269","3277","Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) commonly have gas discs which are kinematically misaligned with the stellar component. These discs feel a torque from the stars and the angular momentum vectors are expected to align quickly. We present results on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation of a massive ETG from the feedback in realistic environments project. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong galactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently reforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120° misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists for about 2 Gyr before the gas–star misalignment angle drops below 20°. The time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much longer than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant amount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular momentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar torques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc decouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component in about six dynamical times. During the late evolution of the misaligned gas disc, the centre aligns faster than the outskirts, resulting in a warped disc. We discuss the observational consequences of the long survival of our misaligned gas disc and how our results can be used to calibrate merger rate estimates from observed gas misalignments.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201262","methods: numerical;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Both telescopes are located on La Palma. We concentrated our WHT search on nova-like variables, whilst our IPHAS search covered all CVs in the IPHAS footprint. We found one shell out of the 24 nova-like variables we examined. The newly discovered shell is around V1315 Aql and has a radius of ∼2.5 arcmin, indicative of a nova eruption approximately 120 yr ago. This result is consistent with the idea that the high mass-transfer rate exhibited by nova-like variables is due to enhanced irradiation of the secondary by the hot white dwarf following a recent nova eruption. The implications of our observations for the lifetime of the nova-like variable phase are discussed. We also examined four asynchronous polars, but found no new shells around any of them, so we are unable to confirm that a recent nova eruption is the cause of the asynchronicity in the white dwarf spin. We find tentative evidence of a faint shell around the dwarf nova V1363 Cyg.

We study how the escape fraction in high-redshift galaxies relates to the physical properties of the halo in which the galaxies form, by computing escape fractions in more than 75 000 haloes between redshifts 27 and 6 that were extracted from the First Billion Years project, high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. We find that the main constraint on the escape fraction is the gas column density in a radius of 10 pc around the stellar populations, causing a strong mass dependence of the escape fraction. The lower potential well in haloes with M200 ≲ 108 M⊙ results in low column densities that can be penetrated by radiation from young stars (age <5 Myr). In haloes with M200 ≳ 108 M⊙ supernova feedback is important, but only ∼30 per cent of the haloes in this mass range have an escape fraction higher than 1 per cent. We find a large range of escape fractions in haloes with similar properties, caused by different distributions of the dense gas in the halo. This makes it very hard to predict the escape fraction on the basis of halo properties and results in a highly anisotropic escape fraction. The strong mass dependence, the large spread and the large anisotropy of the escape fraction may strongly affect the topology of reionization and is something current models of cosmic reionization should strive to take into account.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201216","radiative transfer;methods: numerical;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To fit their light-curve shape–absolute luminosity relation, one needs to assume an intrinsic colour and a likelihood of host galaxy extinction or a convolution of these, a colour distribution prior. The host galaxy extinction prior is typically assumed to be an exponential drop-off for the current supernova programmes ($P(A_V) \propto {\rm e}^{-A_V/\tau _0}$). We explore the validity of this prior using the distribution of extinction values inferred when two galaxies accidentally overlap (an occulting galaxy pair). We correct the supernova luminosity distances from the SDSS-III supernova projects (SDSS-SN) by matching the host galaxies to one of three templates from occulting galaxy pairs based on the host galaxy mass and the AV-bias–prior-scale (τ0) relation from Jha et al. We find that introducing an AV prior that depends on host mass results in lowered luminosity distances for the SDSS-SN on average but it does not reduce the scatter in individual measurements. This points, in our view, to the need for many more occulting galaxy templates to match to SN Ia host galaxies to rule out this possible source of scatter in the SN Ia distance measurements. We match occulting galaxy templates based on both mass and projected radius and we find that one should match by stellar mass first with radius as a secondary consideration. We discuss the caveats of the current approach: the lack of enough radial coverage, the small sample of priors (occulting pairs with HST data), the effect of gravitationally interacting as well as occulting pairs, and whether an exponential distribution is appropriate. Our aim is to convince the reader that a library of occulting galaxy pairs observed with HST will provide sufficient priors to improve (optical) SN Ia measurements to the next required accuracy in cosmology.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201226","dust, extinction;galaxies: general;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: structure;distance scale","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, spectroscopically probing the stellar component at such galactocentric radii is still challenging. Using the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Keck, we have been able to measure the metallicities of the stellar and globular cluster components in 12 early-type galaxies out to more than 10Re. We find similar metallicity gradients for the metal-poor and metal-rich globular cluster subpopulations, suggesting a common formation process for the two subpopulations. This is in conflict with most current theoretical predictions, where the metal-poor globular clusters are thought to be purely accreted and metal-rich globular clusters mostly formed in situ. Moreover, we find that the globular cluster metallicity gradients show a trend with galaxy mass, being steeper in lower mass galaxies than in higher mass galaxies. This is similar to what we find for the outermost galaxy stars and suggests a more active accretion history, with a larger role played by major mergers, in the most massive galaxies. This conclusion is qualitatively consistent with expectations from two-phase galaxy assembly models. Finally, we find that the small difference in metallicity between galaxy stars and metal-rich globular clusters at 1Re may correlate with galaxy mass. The origin of this difference is not currently clear.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201230","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: star clusters: general;galaxies: stellar content","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The short-lived population is known to be a transient group sustained in steady state by the Yarkovsky semimajor axis drift. The long-lived asteroids, however, can exhibit dynamical lifetimes comparable to 4 Gyr. They reside near two isolated islands of the phase space denoted A and B, with an uneven population ratio B/A ≃ 10. The orbits of A-island asteroids are predominantly highly inclined, compared to island B. The size–frequency distribution is steep but the orbital distribution lacks any evidence of a collisional cluster. These observational constraints are somewhat puzzling and therefore the origin of the long-lived asteroids has not been explained so far. With the aim to provide a viable explanation, we first update the resonant population and revisit its physical properties. Using an N-body model with seven planets and the Yarkovsky effect included, we demonstrate that the dynamical depletion of island A is faster, in comparison with island B. Then we investigate (i) the survivability of primordial resonant asteroids and (ii) capture of the population during planetary migration, following a recently described scenario with an escaping fifth giant planet and a jumping-Jupiter instability. We also model the collisional evolution of the resonant population over past 4 Gyr. Our conclusion is that the long-lived group was created by resonant capture from a narrow part of hypothetical outer main-belt family during planetary migration. Primordial asteroids surviving the migration were probably not numerous enough to substantially contribute to the observed population.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201213","methods: numerical;minor planets, asteroids: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To address this issue, we analyse a broad set of simulations of the cosmological population of SBHBs that cover the entire parameter space allowed by current electromagnetic observations in an unbiased way. For each simulation, we construct the expected GW signal and identify the loudest individual sources. We then employ appropriate detection statistics to evaluate the relative probability of detecting each type of source as a function of time for a variety of PTAs; we consider the current International PTA, and speculate into the era of the Square Kilometre Array. The main properties of the first detectable individual SBHBs are also investigated. Contrary to previous work, we cast our results in terms of the detection probability (DP), since the commonly adopted criterion based on a signal-to-noise ratio threshold is statistic-dependent and may result in misleading conclusions for the statistics adopted here. Our results confirm quantitatively that a stochastic signal is more likely to be detected first (with between 75 and 93 per cent probability, depending on the array), but the DP of single-sources is not negligible. Our framework is very flexible and can be easily extended to more realistic arrays and to signal models including environmental coupling and SBHB eccentricity.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201209","black hole physics;gravitation;gravitational waves;methods: data analysis;pulsars: general;galaxies: evolution","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Under the hypothesis that discs are exponential with time-varying scalelengths, we derive a universal theoretical profile for the SFRD, with a linear dependence on two parameters: the specific mass growth rate $\nu _ {\rm M} \equiv \dot{M}_\star /M_\star$ and the specific radial growth rate $\nu _ {\rm R} \equiv \dot{R}_\star /R_\star$ of the disc. We test our theory on a sample of 35 nearby spiral galaxies, for which we derive a measurement of νM and νR. 32/35 galaxies show the signature of ongoing inside-out growth (νR > 0). The typical derived e-folding time-scales for mass and radial growth in our sample are ∼10 and ∼30 Gyr, respectively, with some systematic uncertainties. More massive discs have a larger scatter in νM and νR, biased towards a slower growth, both in mass and size. We find a linear relation between the two growth rates, indicating that our galaxy discs grow in size at ∼0.35 times the rate at which they grow in mass; this ratio is largely unaffected by systematics. Our results are in very good agreement with theoretical expectations if known scaling relations of disc galaxies are not evolving with time.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201204","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: fundamental parameters;galaxies: spiral;galaxies: star formation;galaxies: stellar content;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We model the unknown underlying FRB flux density distribution as a power law with a rate scaling as $S_\nu ^{-5/2+\delta }$ and account for the fact that the FRBs are detected at unknown positions within the telescope beam. We find that the event rate of FRBs located off the Galactic plane may be enhanced by a factor of ∼30–300 per cent relative to objects near the Galactic plane without necessarily affecting the slope of the distribution. For FRBs whose flux densities are subject to relatively weak diffractive scintillation, as is typical for events detected at high Galactic latitudes, we demonstrate that an effect associated with Eddington bias is responsible for the enhancement. The magnitude of the enhancement increases with the steepness of the underlying flux density distribution, so that existing limits on the disparity in event rates between high and low Galactic latitudes suggest that the FRB population has a steep differential flux density distribution, scaling as $S_\nu ^{-3.5}$ or steeper.

We compare the observed fractions with predictions from a semi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and AGN feedback due to mergers and disc instabilities. We facilitate direct morphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to Sérsic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four quadrants of the specific star formation rate–Sérsic index plane and study the build-up of each of these subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star-forming discs declines steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time. The fractions of star-forming spheroids and quiescent discs are both non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied. Our model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the evolution of the two ‘main’ populations (star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids), and approximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts a stronger decline in star-forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent discs, than is seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge growth via disc instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than a model in which bulges can grow only through mergers. We also examine the relative importance of these different physical drivers of transformation (major and minor mergers and disc instabilities).","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201188","galaxies: bulges;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One of the galaxies shows gas kinematics very different from the stellar kinematics, indicating a recent merger or accretion event. We demonstrate that the star formation associated with this event was triggered within the last 100 Myr. The other galaxy shows simple disc rotation in both gas and stellar kinematics, aligned with each other, but in the central region has signatures of an outflow driven by the AGN. Other than the outflow, neither galaxy shows any discontinuity in the ionized gas kinematics at the galaxy's centre. We conclude that in these two cases there is no direct evidence of the AGN being in a supermassive black hole binary system. Our study demonstrates that selecting kinematically offset AGN from single-fibre spectroscopy provides, by definition, samples of kinematically peculiar objects, but integral field spectroscopy or other data are required to determine their true nature.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201223","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In order to explain the properties of SN 2001gh, three powering mechanism are explored, including radioactive decays of a moderately large amount of 56Ni, magnetar spin-down, and interaction of SN ejecta with circumstellar medium. We favour the latter scenario, with a SN Ib wrapped in a dense, circumstellar shell.

The luminosity ratio between the main (AM 2058A) and secondary (AM 2058B) components of the first pair is a factor of ∼ 5, while for the other pair, the main (AM 1228A) component is 20 times more luminous than the secondary (AM 1228B). The four galaxies have pseudo-bulges, with a Sérsic index n < 2. Their observed radial velocities profiles (RVPs) present several irregularities. The receding side of the RVP of AM 2058A is displaced with respect to the velocity field model, while there is a strong evidence that AM 2058B is a tumbling body, rotating along its major axis. The RVPs for AM 1228A indicate a misalignment between the kinematic and photometric major axes. The RVP for AM 1228B is quite perturbed, very likely due to the interaction with AM 1228A. NFW halo parameters for AM 2058A are similar to those of the Milky Way and M 31. The halo mass of AM 1228A is roughly 10 per cent that of AM 2058A. The mass-to-light (M/L) of AM 2058 agrees with the mean value derived for late-type spirals, while the low M/L for AM 1228A may be due to the intense star formation ongoing in this galaxy.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201201","galaxies: general;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: photometry","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The deviation of the centroid of flux corresponding to Stokes parameter Q or U from the centroid of total flux multiplied by dimensionless Stokes parameter q or u, respectively, was used as a signal. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on the basis of observations made in the V band by using an instrument combining features of a two-beam polarimeter with a rotating half-wave plate and a speckle interferometer. The polaroastrometric signal noise is 60–70 μas rms for a total number of accumulated photoelectrons Ne of 109 from a 70-cm telescope; this corresponds to a total integration time of 500 s and an object magnitude V = 6 mag. At smaller Ne, the noise increases as ${\approx} 1.7\,{\rm arcsec}/\sqrt{N_{\rm e}}$, while at larger Ne, it remains the same owing to imperfection of the half-wave plate. For main-sequence stars that are unpolarized and polarized by interstellar dust and the Mira-type variable R Tri the signal was undetectable. For the Mira-type variable χ Cyg the polaroastrometric signal is found to be 310 ± 70 and 300 ± 70 μas for Stokes Q and U, respectively; for o Cet these values are 490 ± 100 and 1160 ± 100 μas. The significant value of the polaroastrometric signal provides evidence of the asymmetry of the polarized flux distribution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201256","instrumentation: polarimeters;techniques: polarimetric;stars: AGB and post-AGB","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In particular, some radial velocities (RVs) measured using Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS) spectra have been shown to be inaccurate, throwing some doubt on the validity of a number of planet detections. Motivated by these results, we have begun the Reanalysis of Archival FEROS specTra (RAFT) programme and here we discuss the first results from this work. We have reanalyzed FEROS data for the stars HD 11977, HD 47536, HD 70573, HD 110014 and HD 122430, all of which are claimed to have at least one planetary companion. We have reduced the raw data and computed the radial velocity variations of these stars, achieving a long-term precision of ∼10 m s−1 on the known stable star τ Ceti, and in good agreement with the residuals to our fits. We confirm the existence of planets around HD 11977, HD 47536 and HD 110014, but with different orbital parameters than those previously published. In addition, we found no evidence of the second planet candidate around HD 47536, nor any companions orbiting HD 122430 and HD 70573. Finally, we report the discovery of a second planet around HD 110014, with a minimum mass of 3.1 MJup and a orbital period of 130 d. Analysis of activity indicators allows us to confirm the reality of our results and also to measure the impact of magnetic activity on our RV measurements. These results confirm that very metal poor stars down to [Fe/H] ∼ −0.7 dex, can indeed form giant planets given the right conditions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201240","techniques: radial velocities;planets and satellites: general;planet–star interactions","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To avoid simply extracting the known underlying correlations between galaxy properties and stellar mass, we create a mass matched sample of galaxies with stellar masses within 9.5 ≤ log M*/h−2 M⊙ ≤ 11 for each environmental population. Using these samples, we show that mass normalized galaxies in different large-scale environments have similar energy outputs, u − r colours, luminosities, and morphologies. Extending our analysis to group and pair environments, we show that galaxies that are not in groups or pairs exhibit similar characteristics to each other regardless of broader environment. For our mass controlled sample, we fail to see a strong dependence of Sérsic index or galaxy luminosity on halo mass, but do find that it correlates very strongly with colour.

Here, we use data from the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies and HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey to analyse the structure and stability of its molecular disc. Our radial profiles exhibit a clear transition at distance R ∼ 1 kpc from the galaxy centre. In particular, the surface density profile breaks at R ≈ 0.8 kpc and is well fitted by a double exponential distribution with scalelengths R1 ≈ 200 pc and R2 ≈ 3 kpc, while the 1D velocity dispersion σ decreases steeply in the central kpc and is approximately constant at larger radii. The fact that we derive and use the full radial profile of σ rather than a constant value is perhaps the most novel feature of our stability analysis. We show that the profile of the Q stability parameter traced by CO emission is remarkably flat and well above unity, while the characteristic instability wavelength exhibits clear signatures of the nuclear starburst and inner bar within bar. We also show that CO-dark molecular gas, stars and other factors can play a significant role in the stability scenario of NGC 6946. Our results provide strong evidence that gravitational instability, radial inflow and disc heating have driven the formation of the inner structures and the dynamics of molecular gas in the central kpc.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201263","instabilities;ISM: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: individual: NGC 6946;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We calculated power density spectra and rms–flux relations for two different stages of activity, i.e. quiescence and regular outbursts. A multicomponent power density spectrum with two break frequencies was found during both activity stages. The rms–flux relation is obvious only in the quiescent data. However, while the collection of all outburst data do not show this variability, every individual outburst does show it in the majority of cases keeping the rms value approximately in the same interval. Furthermore, the same analysis was performed for light-curve subsamples taken from the beginning, middle and the end of the supercycle both for quiescence and regular outbursts. Every light-curve subsample shows the same multicomponent power density spectrum. The stability of the break frequencies over the supercycle can be confirmed for all frequencies except for the high break frequency during outburst, which shows variability, but with rather low confidence. Finally, the low break frequency can be associated with the geometrically thin disc or its inner edge, while the high break frequency can originate from the inner geometrically thick hot disc. Furthermore, with our statistical method to simulate flickering light curves, we show that the outburst flickering light curve of V1504 Cyg needs an additional constant flux level to explain the observed rms–flux behaviour. Therefore, during the outbursts another non-turbulent radiation source should be present.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201253","accretion, accretion discs;turbulence;stars: individual: V1504 Cyg;novae, cataclysmic variables","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The derived ages and metallicities for the dominant stellar populations of the western SMC periphery show a constant metallicity level ([Fe/H] = −1.0 dex) and an approximately constant age value (≈7–8 Gyr). Their age–metallicity relationship (AMR) do not clearly differ from the most comprehensive AMRs derived for almost the entire SMC main body.

Also, the internal toroidal field may play an important role. If the stellar magnetic field is not symmetric with respect to the dipolar moment axis, the pulsar inclination angle may oscillate with a typical amplitude of tens of degrees, due to precession.

We focus on this mass range in order to estimate the masses and calculate the CNO surface abundances of a sample of observed red giants. The stellar models are calculated from the zero-age main sequence till the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Stars of M ≤ 2.2M⊙ are evolved through the core helium flash. In this work, an approach is adopted that improves the mass determination of an observed sample of 21 RGB and early AGB stars. This approach is based on comparing the observationally derived effective temperatures and absolute magnitudes with the calculated values based on our evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A more reliable determination of the stellar masses is achieved by using evolutionary tracks extended to the range of observation. In addition, the predicted CNO surface abundances are compared to the observationally inferred values in order to show how far standard evolutionary calculation can be used to interpret available observations and to illustrate the role of convective mixing. We find that extra mixing beyond the convective boundary determined by the Schwarzschild criterion is needed to explain the observational oxygen isotopic ratios in low-mass stars. The effect of recent determinations of proton capture reactions and their uncertainties on the 16O/17O and 14N/15N ratios is also shown. It is found that the 14N( p, γ)15O reaction is important for predicting the 14N/15N ratio in red giants.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201237","convection;nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances;stars: evolution;stars: low-mass","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Tu",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","3","2536","2543","Unlike the random radial orientation distribution of field elliptical galaxies, galaxies in a cluster are expected to point preferentially towards the centre of the cluster, as a result of the cluster's tidal force on its member galaxies. In this work, an analytic model is formulated to simulate this effect. The deformation time-scale of a galaxy in a cluster is usually much shorter than the time-scale of change of the tidal force; the dynamical process of tidal interaction within the galaxy can thus be ignored. The equilibrium shape of a galaxy is then assumed to be the surface of equipotential that is the sum of the self-gravitational potential of the galaxy and the tidal potential of the cluster at this location. We use a Monte Carlo method to calculate the radial orientation distribution of cluster galaxies, by assuming a Navarro–Frenk–White mass profile for the cluster and the initial ellipticity of field galaxies. The radial angles show a single-peak distribution centred at zero. The Monte Carlo simulations also show that a shift of the reference centre from the real cluster centre weakens the anisotropy of the radial angle distribution. Therefore, the expected radial alignment cannot be revealed if the distribution of spatial position angle is used instead of that of radial angle. The observed radial orientations of elliptical galaxies in cluster Abell 2744 are consistent with the simulated distribution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201266","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: clusters: individual: Abell 2744;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The nature of field compact sources is also investigated according to the measured spectral indices. This work is based on new observations of Puppis A and its surroundings performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array in two configurations using the Compact Array Broad-band Backend centred at 1.75 GHz. We find that the global spectral index of Puppis A is α = −0.563 ± 0.013. Local variations have been detected, however this global index represents well the bulk of the SNR. At the SE, we found a pattern of parallel strips with a flat spectrum compatible with small-scale filaments, although not correlated in detail. The easternmost filament agrees with the idea that the SNR shock front is interacting with an external cloud. There is no evidence of the previously suggested correlation between emissivity and spectral index. A number of compact features are proposed to be evolved clumps of ejecta based on their spectral indices, although dynamic measurements are needed to confirm this hypothesis. We estimate precise spectral indices for the five previously known field sources, two of which are found to be double (one of them, probably triple), and catalogue 40 new sources. In the light of these new determinations, the extragalactic nature previously accepted for some compact sources is now in doubt.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201242","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;techniques: interferometric;ISM: individual objects: Puppis A;ISM: supernova remnants;radio continuum: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have taken the dusty-wind models presented by Keating and collaborators that generated quasar mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and explore their properties (such as geometry, opening angle, and ionic column densities) as a function of Eddington ratio and X-ray weakness. In addition, we present new models with a range of magnetic field strengths and column densities of the dust-free shielding gas interior to the dusty wind. We find this family of models – with input parameters tuned to accurately match the observed mid-IR power in quasar SEDs – provides reasonable values of the Type 1 fraction of quasars and the column densities of warm absorber gas, though it does not explain a purely luminosity-dependent covering fraction for either. Furthermore, we provide predictions of the cumulative distribution of E(B − V) values of quasars from extinction by the wind and the shape of the wind as imaged in the mid-infrared. Within the framework of this model, we predict that the strength of the near-infrared bump from hot dust emission will be correlated primarily with L/LEdd rather than luminosity alone, with scatter induced by the distribution of magnetic field strengths. The empirical successes and shortcomings of these models warrant further investigations into the composition and behaviour of dust and the nature of magnetic fields in the vicinity of actively accreting supermassive black holes.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201227","MHD;galaxies: active;quasars: general;galaxies: Seyfert;infrared: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use these to construct stellar spectra in post-processing, which offers large efficiency savings and allows user-defined spectral bands and dust models to be applied to data stored in the Millennium data repository. We contrast model SFHs from the Millennium Simulation with observed ones from the VESPA algorithm as applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 7 (SDSS-7) catalogue. The overall agreement is good, with both simulated and SDSS galaxies showing a steeper SFH with increased stellar mass. The SFHs of blue and red galaxies, however, show poor agreement between data and simulations, which may indicate that the termination of star formation is too abrupt in the models. The mean star formation rate (SFR) of model galaxies is well defined and is accurately modelled by a double power law at all redshifts: SFR  ∝ 1/(x−1.39 + x1.33), where x = (ta − t)/3.0 Gyr, t is the age of the stars and ta is the lookback time to the onset of galaxy formation; above a redshift of unity, this is well approximated by a gamma function: SFR  ∝ x1.5e−x, where x = (ta − t)/2.0 Gyr. Individual galaxies, however, show a wide dispersion about this mean. When split by mass, the SFR peaks earlier for high-mass galaxies than for lower mass ones, and we interpret this downsizing as a mass-dependence in the evolution of the quenched fraction: the SFHs of star-forming galaxies show only a weak mass-dependence.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201267","methods: numerical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: stellar content","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results requires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface density threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure stripping in haloes less massive than ${\sim }10^{14}{\rm \, M_{{\odot }}}$, and to modify our model for radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass. Massive galaxies (log M⋆/M⊙ ≥ 11.0) assemble most of their mass before z = 1 and are predominantly old and passive at z = 0, while lower mass galaxies assemble later and, for log M⋆/M⊙ ≤ 9.5, are still predominantly blue and star forming at z = 0. This phenomenological but physically based model allows the observations to be interpreted in terms of the efficiency of the various processes that control the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass, gas content, environment and time.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201264","methods: analytical;methods: statistical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As a first experiment, we studied the gaseous response to a bisymmetric spiral arm potential: the widely employed cosine potential model and a self-gravitating three-dimensional density distribution based model called PERLAS. Important differences are noticeable in these simulations, while the simplified cosine potential produces two spiral arms for all cases, the more realistic density-based model produces a response of four spiral arms on the gaseous disc, except for weak arms – i.e. close to the linear regime – where a two-armed structure is formed. In order to compare the stellar and gas response to the spiral arms, we have also included a detailed periodic orbit study and explored different structural parameters within observational uncertainties. The four-armed response has been explained as the result of ultraharmonic resonances, or as shocks with the massive bisymmetric spiral structure, among other. From the results of this work, and comparing the stellar and gaseous responses, we tracked down an alternative explanation to the formation of branches, based only on the orbital response to a self-gravitating spiral arms model. The presence of features such as branches, might be an indication of transiency of the arms.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201246","MHD;Galaxy: disc;Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics;Galaxy: structure;galaxies: spiral;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In particular, we compare standard prescriptions usually adopted in semi-analytic models, with new prescriptions proposed by Kannan et al., based on results from high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, and we show that these new implementations reduce the efficiency of bulge formation through mergers. In addition, we compare our model results with a variety of observational measurements of the fraction of spheroid-dominated galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass, showing that the present uncertainties in the data represent an important limitation to our understanding of spheroid formation. Our results indicate that the main tension between theoretical models and observations does not stem from the survival of purely disc structures (i.e. bulgeless galaxies), rather from the distribution of galaxies of different morphological types, as a function of their stellar mass.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8201221","galaxies: bulges;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

An increasing density of three-body resonances makes the region between the Cybele and Hilda populations dynamically unstable, so that the Cybele zone could be considered the last outpost of an extended main belt. The presence of binary asteroids with large primaries and small secondaries suggested that asteroid families should be found in this region, but only relatively recently the first dynamical groups were identified in this area. Among these, the Sylvia group has been proposed to be one of the oldest families in the extended main belt. In this work we identify families in the Cybele region in the context of the local dynamics and non-gravitational forces such as the Yarkovsky and stochastic Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) effects. We confirm the detection of the new Helga group at ≃3.65 au, which could extend the outer boundary of the Cybele region up to the 5J:-3A mean-motion resonance. We obtain age estimates for the four families, Sylvia, Huberta, Ulla, and Helga, currently detectable in the Cybele region, using Monte Carlo methods that include the effects of stochastic YORP and variability of the solar luminosity. The Sylvia family should be T = 1220 ± 40 Myr old, with a possible older secondary solution. Any collisional Cybele group formed prior to the Late Heavy Bombardment would have been most likely completely dispersed in the jumping Jupiter scenario of planetary migration.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208228","celestial mechanics;minor planets, asteroids: general;minor planets, asteroids: individual: Cybele","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"New chemical evolution analytical solutions including environment effects","E.

In this framework, we assume a star formation rate which follows a linear Schmidt law, and we present new analytical solutions for the evolution of the metallicity (Z) in galaxies. In particular, we take into account environmental effects including primordial and enriched gas infall, outflow, different star formation efficiencies and galactic fountains. The enriched infall is included to take into account galaxy–galaxy interactions. Our main results can be summarized as: (i) when a linear Schmidt law of star formation is assumed, the resulting time evolution of the metallicity Z is the same either for a closed-box model or for an outflow model. (ii) The mass–metallicity relation for galaxies which suffer a chemically enriched infall, originating from another evolved galaxy with no pre-enriched gas, is shifted down in parallel at lower Z values, if compared to the closed box model. (iii) When a galaxy suffers at the same time a primordial infall and a chemically enriched one, the primordial infall always dominates the chemical evolution. (iv) We present new solutions for the metallicity evolution in a galaxy which suffers galactic fountains and an enriched infall from another galaxy at the same time. The analytical solutions presented here can be very important to study the metallicity (oxygen), which is measured in high-redshift objects. These solutions can be very useful: (a) in the context of cosmological semi-analytical models for galaxy formation and evolution, and (b) for the study of compact groups of galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208148","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The SBPs of BCDs in the H band reach ∼26 mag arcsec−2 at the 3σ level, which is so far the deepest NIR imaging of BCDs. Then we fit the SBPs with one- and two-component Sérsic models. About half of the BCDs favour the two-component model which significantly improves the fit quality. The effective radii of the underlying hosts of BCDs in the B band are smaller than those of early-type dwarfs (dEs) and dwarf irregulars at a fixed luminosity. This discrepancy is similar to findings in many previous works. However, the difference in structural parameters between BCDs and other dwarf galaxies seems to be less significant in the H band. Furthermore, we find a remarkable agreement between the underlying hosts of BCDs and dEs. All dwarf galaxies seem to follow a similar luminosity–radius relationship which suggests a unified structural evolution for dwarf galaxies.

Chandra X-ray grating observations have revealed a high-mass-outflow accretion disc wind in this state, and we show that the broad-band X-ray spectrum is remarkably similar to that observed in the so-called hypersoft state of the high-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-3, which possesses a strong stellar wind from a Wolf–Rayet secondary. The power-spectral density (PSD) of GRO J1655-40 shows a bending power-law shape, similar to that of canonical soft states albeit with larger fractional rms. However, the characteristic bend frequency of the PSD is strongly correlated with the X-ray flux, such that the bend frequency increases by two decades for less than a factor 2 increase in flux. The strong evolution of PSD bend frequency for very little change in flux or X-ray spectral shape seems to rule out the suppression of high-frequency variability by scattering in the wind as the origin of the PSD bend. Instead, we suggest that the PSD shape is intrinsic to the variability process and may be linked to the evolution of the scaleheight in a slim disc. An alternative possibility is that variability is introduced by variable absorption and scattering in the wind. We further argue that the hypersoft state in GRO J1655-40 and Cyg X-3 is associated with accretion close to or above the Eddington limit.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208215","accretion, accretion discs;X-rays: binaries;X-rays: individual (GRO J1655-40)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Starting from a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation, we have computed the evolution of the dust in a quasi-static gas density structure typical of self-gravitating disc. For different grain size distributions, we have investigated the capability of spiral arms to trap particles. We have run 3D radiative transfer simulations in order to construct maps of the expected emission at (sub-)millimetre and near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, we have simulated realistic observations of our disc models at (sub-)millimetre and near-infrared wavelengths as they may appear with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) and the High-Contrast Coronographic Imager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIAO) in order to investigate whether there are observational signatures of the spiral structure. We find that the pressure inhomogeneities induced by gravitational instabilities produce a non-negligible dynamical effect on centimetre-sized particles leading to significant overdensities in spiral arms. We also find that the spiral structure is readily detectable by ALMA over a wide range of (sub-)millimetre wavelengths and by HiCIAO in near-infrared scattered light for non-face-on discs located in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. In addition, we find clear spatial spectral index variations across the disc, revealing that the dust trapping produces a migration of large grains that can be potentially investigated through multiwavelength observations in the (sub-)millimetric. Therefore, the spiral arms observed to date in protoplanetary disc might be interpreted as density waves induced by the development of gravitational instabilities.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208210","accretion, accretion discs;gravitation;instabilities;planets and satellites: formation;stars: pre-main-sequence;submillimetre: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Frequency-dependent effects of gravitational lensing within plasma","A. Rogers",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","1","17","25","The interaction between refraction from a distribution of inhomogeneous plasma and gravitational lensing introduces novel effects to the paths of light rays passing by a massive object. The plasma contributes additional terms to the equations of motion, and the resulting ray trajectories are frequency–dependent. Lensing phenomena and circular orbits are investigated for plasma density distributions N ∝ 1/rh with h ≥ 0 in the Schwarzschild space–time. For rays passing by the mass near the plasma frequency refractive effects can dominate, effectively turning the gravitational lens into a mirror. We obtain the turning points, circular orbit radii and angular momentum for general h. Previous results have shown that light rays behave like massive particles with an effective mass given by the plasma frequency for a constant density h = 0. We study the behaviour for general h and show that when h = 2 the plasma term acts like an additional contribution to the angular momentum of the passing ray. When h = 3 the potential and radii of circular orbits are analogous to those found in studies of massless scalar fields on the Schwarzschild background. As a physically motivated example we study the pulse profiles of a compact object with antipodal hotspots sheathed in a dense plasma, which shows dramatic frequency-dependent shifts from the behaviour in vacuum. Finally, we consider the potential observability and applications of such frequency-dependent plasma effects in general relativity for several types of neutron star.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208176","gravitation;plasmas;stars: neutron;pulsars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Each galaxy is a mosaic of several pointings observed with the integral-field unit (IFU) SAURON leading to a tenfold sharper spatial resolution (∼100 pc) compared to ongoing IFU surveys. In this paper we focus on the kinematic properties. We calculate the bar strength $Q_{\rm _b}$ from classical torque analysis using 3.6-μm Spitzer (S4G) images, but also develop a new method based solely on the kinematics. A correlation between the two measurements is found and backed up by N-body simulations, verifying the measurement of $Q_{\rm _b}$. We find that bar strengths from ionized gas kinematics are ∼2.5 larger than those measured from stellar kinematics and that stronger bars have enhanced influence on inner kinematic features. We detect that stellar angular momentum ‘dips’ at 0.2 ± 0.1 bar lengths and half of our sample exhibits an anticorrelation of h3–stellar velocity (v/σ) in these central parts. An increased flattening of the stellar σ gradient with increasing bar strength supports the notion of bar-induced orbit mixing.

We demonstrate this method using a field of the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and show that the filamentary structure typically seen in $|\nabla \boldsymbol {P}|$ maps depends strongly on the instrumental resolution. Our analysis reveals that different networks of filaments are present on different angular scales. The wavelet formalism allows us to calculate the power spectrum of the fluctuations seen in $|\nabla \boldsymbol {P}|$ and to determine the scaling behaviour of this quantity. The power spectrum is found to follow a power law with γ ≈ 2.1. We identify a small drop in power between scales of 80 ≲ l ≲ 300 arcmin, which corresponds well to the overlap in the u–v plane between the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory 26-m telescope data. We suggest that this drop is due to undersampling present in the 26-m telescope data. In addition, the wavelet coefficient distributions show higher skewness on smaller scales than at larger scales. The spatial distribution of the outliers in the tails of these distributions creates a coherent subset of filaments correlated across multiple scales, which trace the sharpest changes in the polarization vector $\boldsymbol {P}$ within the field. We suggest that these structures may be associated with highly compressive shocks in the medium. The power spectrum of the field excluding these outliers shows a steeper power law with γ ≈ 2.5.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208179","methods: statistical;techniques: image processing;ISM: general;ISM: magnetic fields;ISM: structure;radio continuum: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We investigate simulations using three different initial mean number densities of n0 = 30, 100 and 300 cm−3 that span the range of values typical for MCs in the solar neighbourhood. Furthermore, we model the CO line emission in a post-processing step using a radiative transfer code. We evaluate Δ-variance spectra for centroid velocity (CV) maps as well as for integrated intensity and column density maps for various chemical components: the total, H2 and 12CO number density and the integrated intensity of both the 12CO and 13CO (J = 1 → 0) lines. The spectral slopes of the Δ-variance computed on the CV maps for the total and H2 number density are significantly steeper compared to the different CO tracers. We find slopes for the linewidth–size relation ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 for the total and H2 density models, while the slopes for the various CO tracers range from 0.2 to 0.4 and underestimate the values for the total and H2 density by a factor of 1.5–3.0. We demonstrate that optical depth effects can significantly alter the Δ-variance spectra. Furthermore, we report a critical density threshold of ∼100 cm−3 at which the Δ-variance slopes of the various CO tracers change sign.

Our most general solutions show, as a function of the radius, a segregation of three physical regimes: (1) an inner core of almost constant density governed by degenerate quantum statistics; (2) an intermediate region with a sharply decreasing density distribution followed by an extended plateau, implying quantum corrections; (3) an asymptotic, ρ ∝ r−2 classical Boltzmann regime fulfilling, as an eigenvalue problem, a fixed value of the flat rotation curves. This eigenvalue problem determines, for each value of the central degeneracy parameter, the mass of the ino as well as the radius and mass of the inner quantum core. Consequences of this alternative approach to the central and halo regions of galaxies, ranging from dwarf to big spirals, for SgrA*, as well as for the existing estimates of the ino mass, are outlined.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208152","methods: numerical;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: nuclei;galaxies: structure;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We compare the metallicity profiles of a sample of H I-rich galaxies against a control sample of H I-‘normal’ galaxies. We find the metallicity gradient of a galaxy to be strongly correlated with its H I mass fraction ($\textrm {M(H\,\small {I})} / \textrm {M}_{\ast }$). We note that some galaxies exhibit a steeper metallicity profile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. These galaxies are found in both the H I-rich and control samples. This contradicts a previous indication that these outer drops are exclusive to H I-rich galaxies. These effects are not driven by bars, although we do find some indication that barred galaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. By applying a simple analytical model, we are able to account for the variety of metallicity profiles that the two samples present. The success of this model implies that the metallicity in these isolated galaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by star formation. This insight could provide an explanation of the observed local mass–metallicity relation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208208","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The main interest is to study the possibility that Alfvén waves triggers the energy flux transfer towards the quiet solar corona and heat it, including the case that two consecutive waves can occur. We find that in the case of arcades, short or large, the transferred fluxes by Alfvén waves are sufficient to heat the quiet corona only during a small lapse of time and in a certain region. In the case of funnels the threshold is achieved only when the wave is faster than 10 km s−1, which is extremely high. We conclude from our analysis, that Alfvén waves, even in the optimistic scenario of having two consecutive Alfvén wave pulses, cannot transport enough energy as to heat the quiet corona.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208202","MHD;Sun: atmosphere;Sun: corona","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Its companion is a normal star-forming galaxy infalling with a velocity of 185 km s−1at a projected separation of 4.8 kpc. Using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), we detect a strong H I 21-cm absorption at the systemic redshift of the radio galaxy with N(H I)∼9 × 1021 cm−2 for an assumed spin temperature of 100 K. Such a strong H I 21-cm absorption is rare and has been seen only in a few compact radio sources associated with similar merging galaxy pairs. Milliarcsecond resolution Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations resolve the radio source into a compact symmetric object with the hotspot separation of 89 pc. The 21-cm absorption is detected in the VLBA spectra towards both the radio lobes albeit with a strong optical depth gradient. We show that the strong 21-cm absorption is consistent with it being arising from a clumpy circumnuclear disc/torus. We also detect two weaker absorption lines redshifted with respect to the radio source in the WSRT/GMRT spectrum. They probably represent cold (i.e. T ≤ 104 K) H I gas falling into the radio source. The presence of high concentration of H I gas in the circumnuclear regions and signature of infalling cold gas allows us to conjecture that the young radio source may have been triggered by the gas infall due to the ongoing merger.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208147","ISM: lines and bands;quasars: absorption lines;quasars: individual: SDSS J094221.98+062335.2","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using a proxy for the intrinsic position angle of an observed galaxy, we develop techniques for cleanly separating weak gravitational lensing signals from intrinsic alignment contamination in forthcoming radio surveys. Random errors on the intrinsic orientation estimates introduce biases into the shear and intrinsic alignment estimates. However, we show that these biases can be corrected for if the error distribution is accurately known. We demonstrate our methods using simulations, where we reconstruct the shear and intrinsic alignment auto- and cross-power spectra in three overlapping redshift bins. We find that the intrinsic position angle information can be used to successfully reconstruct both the lensing and intrinsic alignment power spectra with negligible residual bias.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208225","gravitational lensing: weak;methods: analytical;methods: statistical;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Another possible signature of lines produced in the accretion disc can be a modulation of the line strength with the pulse phase. We have found that the line fluxes have pulse-phase dependence, making 4U 1626–67 only the second pulsar after Hercules X–1 to show such variability. The O VII line at 0.568 keV from 4U 1626–67 varied by a factor of ∼4, stronger than the continuum variability, which supports the accretion-disc origin. The line flux variability can appear due to variable illumination of the accretion disc by the pulsar or, more likely, a warp-like structure in the accretion disc.

The galaxies are followed in a rare, heavily overdense region within a ∼5σ density peak, which can host high-z quasars, and in an average density region, down to the stellar mass of Mstar ∼ 4 × 107 M⊙. We find that the overdense regions evolve at a substantially accelerated pace – the most massive galaxy has grown to Mstar ∼ 8.4 × 1010 M⊙ by z = 6.3, contains dust of Mdust ∼ 4.1 × 108 M⊙, and is associated with a very high star formation rate, SFR ∼ 745 M⊙ yr− 1. The attained SFR–Mstar correlation results in the specific SFR slowly increasing with Mstar. Most of the UV radiation in massive galaxies is absorbed by the dust, its escape fraction fesc is low, increasing slowly with time. Galaxies in the average region have less dust, and agree with the observed UV LF. The LF of the overdense region is substantially higher, and contains much brighter galaxies. The massive galaxies are bright in the infrared (IR) due to the dust thermal emission, with LIR ∼ 3.7 × 1012 L⊙ at z = 6.3, while LIR < 1011 L⊙ for the low-mass galaxies. Therefore, ALMA can probe massive galaxies in the overdense region up to z ∼ 10 with a reasonable integration time. The UV spectral properties of discy galaxies depend significantly upon the viewing angle. The stellar and dust masses of the most massive galaxy in the overdense region are comparable to those of the sub-millimetre galaxy found by Riechers et al. at z = 6.3, while the modelled SFR and the sub-millimetre flux fall slightly below the observed one. Statistical significance of these similarities and differences will only become clear with the upcoming ALMA observations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208212","radiative transfer;methods: numerical;dust, extinction;galaxies: formation;infrared: galaxies;ultraviolet: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that feedback is able to increase the quantities of dense gas present, but decreases the rate and efficiency of the conversion of gas to stars relative to control simulations in which feedback is absent. Star formation in these calculations often proceeds at a rate substantially slower than the freefall rate in the dense gas. This decoupling is due to the weakening of, and expulsion of gas from, the deepest parts of the clouds’ potential wells where most of the star formation occurs in the control simulations. This results in large fractions of the stellar populations in the feedback simulation becoming dissociated from dense gas. However, where star formation does occur in both control and feedback simulations, it does so in dense gas, so the correlation between star formation activity and dense gas is preserved. The overall dynamical effects of feedback on the clusters are minimal, with only small fraction of stars becoming unbound, despite large quantities of gas being expelled from some clouds. This owes to the settling of the stars into virialized and stellar-dominated configurations before the onset of feedback. By contrast, the effects of feedback on the observable properties of the clusters – their U-, B- and V-band magnitudes – are strong and sudden. The time-scales on which the clusters become visible and unobscured are short compared with the time-scales which the clouds are actually destroyed.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208178","stars: formation;ISM: bubbles;H II regions","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, we study the star formation efficiency in the gas disc of NGC 4203 by using the UV, deep optical imaging and infrared data. We confirm that the H I disc consists of two distinct components: an inner star-forming ring with radius from ∼1 to ∼3 Reff and an outer disc. The outer H I disc is nine times more massive than the inner H I ring. At the location of the inner H I ring, we detect spiral-like structure both in the deep g′ − r′ image and in the 8 μm Spitzer-Infrared Array Camera image, extending in radius up to ∼ 3 Reff. These two gas components have a different star formation efficiency likely due to the different metallicity and dust content. The inner component has a star formation efficiency very similar to the inner regions of late-type galaxies. Although the outer component has a very low star formation efficiency, it is similar to that of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and dwarfs. We suggest that these differences can be explained with different gas origins for the two components such as stellar mass loss for the inner H I ring and accretion from the inter galactic medium for the outer H I disc. The low-level star formation efficiency in the outer H I disc is not enough to change the morphology of NGC 4203, making the depletion time of the H I gas much too long.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208224","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: individual: NGC 4203;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We apply our rotational dynamics equation to the Crab pulsar, including intrinsic distortions of the star and various electromagnetic torques, to investigate the possibility that the counter-alignment of the magnetic inclination angle, as suggested by recent observations, could be explained by pulsar precession. We find that if the effective principal axis of the pulsar is nearly aligned with either the magnetic dipole axis or the rotation axis, then precession may account for the observed counter-alignment over decade time-scales.

In addition, the comparison between U and V light curves revealed that the 68 d brightness variations are accompanied by a variable reddening effect of ΔE(U − V) = 0.38. Spectroscopic data sets demonstrated pronounced variations in spectral profiles of Balmer, helium and singly ionized metal lines and indicated that these variations occur on a time-scale of a few days.

A microwave-driven atomic source can be used to generate cold atomic nitrogen (N (4S)) for reactivity study of ices relevant to the Oort cloud. Without any additional source of energy, atomic nitrogen does not react with CO molecules to form NCO. This is consistent with a previous theoretical investigation carried out by Yazidi et al., who have shown that the potential energy surface for the CO (X1Σ+) + N (4S) system is purely dissociative. On the other hand, a very small amount of water is sufficient to induce a reaction between these two species. This three-body reaction leads to the formation of the HNCO monomer, the (HNCO)(H2O) complex, and the hydroxyl radical.

A magnetic field is likely carried into the gap, potentially influencing the flow. Gap crossing has been simulated with varying degrees of attention to field evolution [pure hydrodynamical, ideal, and resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)], but as yet there has been no detailed assessment of the role of the field accounting for all three key non-ideal MHD effects: Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift. We present a detailed investigation of gap magnetic field structure as determined by non-ideal effects. We assess susceptibility to turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and angular momentum loss from large-scale fields. As full non-ideal simulations are computationally expensive, we take an a posteriori approach, estimating MHD quantities from the pure hydrodynamical gap-crossing simulation by Tanigawa, Ohtsuki & Machida. We calculate the ionization fraction and estimate field strength and geometry to determine the strength of non-ideal effects. We find that the protoplanetary disc field would be easily drawn into the gap and circumplanetary disc. Hall drift dominates, so that much of the gap is conditionally MRI unstable depending on the alignment of the field and disc rotation axes. Field alignment also influences the strong toroidal field component permeating the gap. Large-scale magnetic forces are small in the circumplanetary disc, indicating that they cannot drive accretion there. However, turbulence will be key during satellite growth as it affects critical disc features, such as the location of the ice line.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208155","magnetic fields;MHD;planets and satellites: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Although its compact remnant was discovered in 1999 by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, nowadays it is widely accepted that a neutron star lies in the centre of this supernova remnant. In addition, new observations suggest that such a neutron star with a low magnetic field and evidence of a carbon atmosphere could have suffered a hypercritical accretion phase seconds after the explosion. Considering this hypercritical accretion episode, we compute the neutrino cooling effect, the number of events and neutrino flavour ratios expected on Hyper-Kamiokande Experiment. The neutrino cooling effect (the emissivity and luminosity of neutrinos) is obtained through numerical simulations performed in a customized version of the FLASH code. Based on these simulations, we forecast that the number of events expected on the Hyper-Kamiokande Experiment is around 3195. Similarly, we estimate the neutrino flavour ratios to be detected considering the neutrino effective potential due to the thermal and magnetized plasma and thanks to the envelope of the star. It is worth noting that our estimates correspond to the only trustworthy method for verifying the hypercritical phase and although this episode took place 330 years ago, at present supernova remnants with these similarities might occur thus confirming our predictions for this phase.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208151","hydrodynamics;magnetic fields;neutrinos;plasmas;stars: neutron;super-novae: individual: Cassiopeia A","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Through a simple one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model we estimate the expected very high energy flux, finding that in the majority of cases it is within the reach of present generation of Cherenkov arrays or of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208197","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;galaxies: active;galaxies: jets;gamma-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"On the nature of the radial orbit instability in spherically symmetric collisionless stellar systems","E. V. Polyachenko; I. G. Shukhman",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","1","601","610","We consider a two-parametric family of radially anisotropic models with non-singular density distribution in the centre. If highly eccentric orbits are locked near the centre, the characteristic growth rate of the instability is much less than the Jeans and dynamic frequencies of the stars (slow modes). The instability occurs only for even spherical harmonics and the perturbations are purely growing (aperiodic). On the contrary, if all orbits nearly reach the outer radius of the sphere, both even and odd harmonics are unstable. Unstable odd modes oscillate having characteristic frequencies of the order of the dynamical frequencies (fast modes). Unstable even harmonics contain a single aperiodic mode and several oscillatory modes, the aperiodic mode being the most unstable. The question of the nature of the radial orbit instability (ROI) is revisited. Two main interpretations of ROI have been suggested in the literature. The first refers to the classical Jeans instability associated with the lack of velocity dispersion of stars in the transverse direction. The second interpretation refers to Lynden-Bell's orbital approach to bar formation in disc galaxies, which implies slowness and bi-symmetry of the perturbation. Oscillatory modes, odd spherical harmonics modes and non-slow modes found in one of the models show that the orbital interpretation is not the only possible interpretation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208165","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: nuclei","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

With these data products we study the non-circular motions, in particular those found along the bars and spiral arms. The data indicate that the amplitude of the non-circular motions created by the bar does not correlate with the bar strength indicators. The amplitude of those non-circular motions in the spiral arms does not correlate with either arm class or star formation rate along the spiral arms.

The nature of the outflows depends strongly on this angle: jet-like outflows are not produced at all when ϑ > 30°, and a collimated outflow is not sustained when ϑ > 10°.

Using spectroscopic and imaging observations of the afterglow and host of the long-duration Swift GRB 121024A at z = 2.30, we give one of the most complete views of a GRB host/environment to date. We observe a strong damped Lyα absorber (DLA) with a hydrogen column density of log $N({\rm H\,{\small I}})\,=\,21.88\pm 0.10$, H2 absorption in the Lyman–Werner bands (molecular fraction of log(f) ≈−1.4; fourth solid detection of molecular hydrogen in a GRB-DLA), the nebular emission lines Hα, Hβ, [O II], [O III] and [N II], as well as metal absorption lines. We find a GRB host galaxy that is highly star forming (SFR ∼ 40 M⊙ yr−1), with a dust-corrected metallicity along the line of sight of [Zn/H]corr = −0.6 ± 0.2 ([O/H] ∼ −0.3 from emission lines), and a depletion factor [Zn/Fe] = 0.85 ± 0.04. The molecular gas is separated by 400 km s−1 (and 1–3 kpc) from the gas that is photoexcited by the GRB.

We dissect the host galaxy by characterizing its molecular component, the excited gas, and the line-emitting star-forming regions. The extinction curve for the line of sight is found to be unusually flat (RV ∼ 15). We discuss the possibility of an anomalous grain size distributions. We furthermore discuss the different metallicity determinations from both absorption and emission lines, which gives consistent results for the line of sight to GRB 121024A.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208203","gamma-ray burst: individual: GRB 121024A;galaxies: abundances","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such perturbations can originate from massive planets or from encounters with other stars. The latter can have an origin in the star cluster in which the planetary system was born, or from random encounters once the planetary system has escaped its parental cluster. The probability of a random encounter, either in a star cluster or in the Galactic field depends on the local stellar density, the velocity dispersion and the time spend in that environment. By adopting order of magnitude estimates, we argue that the majority of planetary systems born in open clusters will have a Parking zone, in which planetesimals are affected by encounters in their parental star cluster but remain unperturbed after the star has left the cluster. Objects found in this range of semimajor axis and eccentricity preserve the memory of the encounter that last affected their orbits, and they can therefore be used to reconstruct this encounter. Planetary systems born in a denser environment, such as in a globular cluster are unlikely to have a Parking zone. We further argue that some planetary systems may have a Frozen zone, in which orbits are not affected either by the more inner massive planets or by external influences. Objects discovered in this zone will have preserved information about their formation in their orbital parameters.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208168","minor planets, asteroids: general;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;planets and satellites: individual: Sedna, 2012VP133;planet–star interactions;stars: individual: WISE J072003.20-084651.2","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Most interactions happen at large-scale density contrast δ ≃ 20, regardless of the redshift corresponding to groups and relatively dense part of filaments. However, the fraction of interacting target is maximum at δ ≃ 1000. We provide a new empirical fitting form for the interaction rate as a function of the halo mass, large-scale density, and redshift. We also report the existence of two modes of interactions from the distributions of mass ratio and relative distance, implying two different physical origins of the interaction.

Especially the trapping of stars in the disc and Galactic halo by resonances on the Galactic plane, induced by the Galactic bar, has been analysed in detail. To this purpose, a new method is presented to delineate the trapping regions using empirical diagrams of some orbital properties obtained in the Galactic potential. In these diagrams, we plot in the inertial Galactic frame a characteristic orbital energy versus a characteristic orbital angular momentum, or versus the orbital Jacobi constant in the reference frame of the bar, when this is the only non-axisymmetric component in the Galactic potential. With these diagrams, some trapping regions are obtained in the disc and halo using a sample of disc stars and halo stars in the solar neighbourhood. We compute several families of periodic orbits on the Galactic plane, some associated with this resonant trapping. In particular, we find that the trapping effect of these resonances on the Galactic plane can extend several kpc from this plane, trapping stars in the Galactic halo. The purpose of our analysis is to investigate if the trapping regions contain some known moving groups in our Galaxy. We have applied our method to the Kapteyn group, a moving group in the halo, and we have found that this group appears not to be associated with a particular resonance on the Galactic plane.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208205","The Galaxy;Galaxy: bulge;Galaxy: halo;Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics;Galaxy: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Testing the modern merger hypothesis via the assembly of massive blue elliptical galaxies in the local Universe","T. Haines; D. H. McIntosh; S. F. Sánchez; C. Tremonti; G. Rudnick",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","1","433","454","The modern merger hypothesis offers a method of forming a new elliptical galaxy through merging two equal-mass, gas-rich disc galaxies fuelling a nuclear starburst followed by efficient quenching and dynamical stabilization. A key prediction of this scenario is a central concentration of young stars during the brief phase of morphological transformation from highly disturbed remnant to new elliptical galaxy. To test this aspect of the merger hypothesis, we use integral field spectroscopy to track the stellar Balmer absorption and 4000-Å break strength indices as a function of galactic radius for 12 massive (M* ≥ 1010 M⊙), nearby (z ≤ 0.03), visually-selected plausible new ellipticals with blue-cloud optical colours and varying degrees of morphological peculiarities. We find that these index values and their radial dependence correlate with specific morphological features such that the most disturbed galaxies have the smallest 4000-Å break strengths and the largest Balmer absorption values. Overall, two-thirds of our sample are inconsistent with the predictions of the modern merger hypothesis. Of these eight, half exhibit signatures consistent with recent minor merger interactions. The other half have star formation histories similar to local, quiescent early-type galaxies. Of the remaining four galaxies, three have the strong morphological disturbances and star-forming optical colours consistent with being remnants of recent, gas-rich major mergers, but exhibit a weak, central burst consistent with forming ∼5 per cent of their stars. The final galaxy possesses spectroscopic signatures of a strong, centrally concentrated starburst and quiescent core optical colours indicative of recent quenching (i.e. a post-starburst signature) as prescribed by the modern merger hypothesis.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208222","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: peculiar;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We analysed multiwavelength observations from γ-rays to radio performed from 2011 January to March, which were triggered by the high activity detected at optical frequencies. These observations constitute the most precise determination of the broad-band emission of 1ES 0806+524 to date. The stereoscopic Major Atmospheric Gamma-Ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) observations yielded a γ-ray signal above 250 GeV of (3.7 ± 0.7) per cent of the Crab Nebula flux with a statistical significance of 9.9σ. The multiwavelength observations showed significant variability in essentially all energy bands, including a VHE γ-ray flare that lasted less than one night, which provided unprecedented evidence for short-term variability in 1ES 0806+524. The spectrum of this flare is well described by a power law with a photon index of 2.97 ± 0.29 between ∼150 GeV and 1 TeV and an integral flux of (9.3 ± 1.9) per cent of the Crab nebula flux above 250 GeV. The spectrum during the non-flaring VHE activity is compatible with the only available VHE observation performed in 2008 with VERITAS when the source was in a low optical state. The broad-band spectral energy distribution can be described with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model with parameters typical for HBLs, indicating that 1ES 0806+524 is not substantially different from the HBLs previously detected.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208173","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;galaxies: active;BL Lacertae objects: individual: 1ES 0806+524;galaxies: jets;gamma rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We here present evidence for an advanced, gas-rich (‘wet’) merger associated with a powerful radio galaxy at a redshift of z ∼ 2. This radio galaxy, MRC 0152-209, is the most infrared-luminous high-redshift radio galaxy known in the Southern hemisphere. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we obtained high-resolution CO(1–0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) imaging and William Herschel Telescope long-slit spectroscopy. We find that, while roughly MH2 ∼ 2 × 1010 M⊙ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy, another MH2 ∼ 3 × 1010 M⊙ is spread across a total extent of ∼60 kpc. Most of this widespread CO(1–0) appears to follow prominent tidal features visible in the rest-frame near-UV HST/WFPC2 imaging. Lyα emission shows an excess over He II, but a deficiency over LIR, which is likely the result of photoionization by enhanced but very obscured star formation that was triggered by the merger. In terms of feedback, the radio source is aligned with widespread CO(1–0) emission, which suggests that there is a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of cold molecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. Its optical appearance, combined with the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of MRC 0152-209, leads us to adopt the name ‘Dragonfly Galaxy’.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208184","ISM: jets and outflows;galaxies: active;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: individual: MRC 0152-209;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: starburst","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The main advantage of this approach is that we can account for a broad range of degeneracies between the planet signal and systematics without actually having to specify a deterministic functional form for the latter. Our results do not confirm a previous claim of water absorption in transmission. Instead, our results are more consistent with a featureless transmission spectrum, possibly due to a cloud deck obscuring molecular absorption bands. For the emission data, our values are not consistent with the thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere that was originally inferred from these data. Instead, we agree with another re-analysis of these same data, which concluded a non-inverted atmosphere provides a better fit. We find that a solar-abundance clear-atmosphere model without a thermal inversion underpredicts the measured emission in the 4.5 μm channel, which may suggest the atmosphere is depleted in carbon monoxide. An acceptable fit to the emission data can be achieved by assuming that the planet radiates as an isothermal blackbody with a temperature of 1484 ± 18 K.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208177","methods: data analysis;planets and satellites: atmospheres;planets and satellites: general;stars: individual: HD 209458","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that equipartition is satisfied only if the jet opening angle in the radio core region is close to the values found observationally, ≃0.1–0.2 divided by the bulk Lorentz factor, Γj. Larger values, e.g. 1/Γj, would imply magnetic fields much above equipartition. A small jet opening angle implies in turn the magnetization parameter of ≪1. We determine the jet magnetic flux taking into account this effect. We find that the transverse-averaged jet magnetic flux is fully compatible with the model of jet formation due to black hole (BH) spin-energy extraction and the accretion being a magnetically arrested disc (MAD). We calculate the jet average mass-flow rate corresponding to this model and find it consists of a substantial fraction of the mass accretion rate. This suggests the jet composition with a large fraction of baryons. We also calculate the average jet power, and find it moderately exceeds the accretion power, $\dot{M} c^2$, reflecting BH spin energy extraction. We find our results for radio galaxies at low Eddington ratios are compatible with MADs but require a low radiative efficiency, as predicted by standard accretion models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208219","acceleration of particles;magnetic fields;radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;ISM: jets and outflows;galaxies: jets;quasars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Long-term XMM–Newton investigation of two particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries in NGC 6604: HD 168112 and HD 167971","M. De Becker",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","1","1070","1080","The long-term (over more than one decade) X-ray emission from two massive stellar systems known to be particle accelerators is investigated using XMM–Newton. Their X-ray properties are interpreted taking into account recent information about their multiplicity and orbital parameters. The two targets, HD 168112 and HD 167971, appear to be overluminous in X-rays, lending additional support to the idea that a significant contribution of the X-ray emission comes from colliding-wind regions. The variability of the X-ray flux from HD 168112 is interpreted in terms of varying separation expected to follow the 1/D rule for adiabatic shocked winds. For HD 167971, marginal decrease of the X-ray flux in September 2002 could tentatively be explained by a partial wind eclipse in the close pair. No long-term variability could be demonstrated despite the significant difference of separation between 2002 and 2014. This suggests that the colliding-wind region in the wide orbit does not contribute a lot to the total X-ray emission, with a main contribution coming from the radiative shocked winds in the eclipsing pair. The latter result provides evidence that shocks in a colliding-wind region may be efficient particle accelerators even in the absence of bright X-ray emission, suggesting that particle acceleration may operate in a wide range of conditions. Finally, in hierarchical triple O-type systems, thermal X-rays do not necessarily constitute an efficient tracer to detect the wind–wind interaction in the long-period orbit.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208156","binaries: general;stars: early-type;stars: individual: HD 167971;stars: individual: HD 168112;X-rays: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Averaging four eclipses reveals resolved eclipses of the white dwarf and bright spot. We determined the system parameters by fitting a parametrized eclipse model to the averaged light curve. We obtain a mass ratio of q = 0.087 ± 0.006 and inclination i = 85$_{.}^{\circ}$2 ± 0$_{.}^{\circ}$9. The primary and donor masses were found to be Mw = 0.73 ± 0.03 M⊙ and Md = 0.064 ± 0.005 M⊙, respectively. Through multicolour photometry a temperature of the white dwarf of Tw = 13 200 ± 700 K and a distance of 220 ± 50 pc were determined. The evolutionary state of PHL 1445 is uncertain. We are able to rule out a significantly evolved donor, but not one that is slightly evolved. Formation with a brown dwarf donor is plausible, though the brown dwarf would need to be no older than 600 Myr at the start of mass transfer, requiring an extremely low mass ratio (q = 0.025) progenitor system. PHL 1445 joins SDSS 1433 as a sub-period minimum CV with a substellar donor. The existence of two such systems raises an alternative possibility that current estimates for the intrinsic scatter and/or position of the period minimum may be in error.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208200","binaries: close;binaries: eclipsing;brown dwarfs;stars: dwarf novae;stars: individual: PHL 1445","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The LVs have a mass range of 1–1500 × 1010 M⊙. We follow the dynamical evolution of the density field inside these initially spherical LVs from z = 10 up to zlow = 0.05, witnessing highly non-linear, anisotropic mass rearrangements within them, leading to the emergence of the local cosmic web (CW). These mass arrangements have been analysed in terms of the reduced inertia tensor $I_{ij}^r$, focusing on the evolution of the principal axes of inertia and their corresponding eigendirections, and paying particular attention to the times when the evolution of these two structural elements declines. In addition, mass and component effects along this process have also been investigated. We have found that deformations are led by dark matter dynamics and they transform most of the initially spherical LVs into prolate shapes, i.e. filamentary structures. An analysis of the individual freezing-out time distributions for shapes and eigendirections shows that first most of the LVs fix their three axes of symmetry (like a skeleton) early on, while accretion flows towards them still continue. Very remarkably, we have found that more massive LVs fix their skeleton earlier on than less massive ones. We briefly discuss the astrophysical implications our findings could have, including the galaxy mass–morphology relation and the effects on the galaxy–galaxy merger parameter space, among others.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208163","gravitation;hydrodynamics;methods: numerical;galaxies: formation;cosmology: theory;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find no evidence of differences in n(ϵ), although the nearest cluster in the sample (the Coma Cluster) is the largest outlier (P(same) < 0.05). We then study n(ϵ) within the clusters, and find that ϵ increases with projected cluster-centric radius R (hereafter the ϵ-R relation). This trend is preserved at fixed magnitude, showing that this relation exists over and above the trend of more luminous galaxies to be both rounder and more common in the centres of clusters. The ϵ-R relation is particularly strong in the subsample of intrinsically flattened galaxies (ϵ > 0.4), therefore it is not a consequence of the increasing fraction of round slow rotator galaxies near cluster centers. Furthermore, the ϵ-R relation persists for just smooth flattened galaxies and for galaxies with de Vaucouleurs-like light profiles, suggesting that the variation of the spiral fraction with radius is not the underlying cause of the trend. We interpret our findings in light of the classification of early type galaxies (ETGs) as fast and slow rotators. We conclude that the observed trend of decreasing ϵ towards the centres of clusters is evidence for physical effects in clusters causing fast rotator ETGs to have a lower average intrinsic ellipticity near the centres of rich clusters.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208220","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: photometry","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We define distribution functions for the stellar disc and dark halo that depend on phase-space position only through action coordinates. We then use an iterative approach to find the corresponding gravitational potential. We study the adiabatic response of the initially spherical dark halo to the introduction of the baryonic component and find that the halo flattens in its inner regions with final minor–major axis ratios q = 0.75–0.95. The extent of the flattening depends on the velocity structure of the halo particles with radially biased models exhibiting a stronger response. In this latter case, which is according to cosmological simulations the most likely one, the new density structure resembles a ‘dark disc’ superimposed on a spherical halo. We discuss the implications of these results for our recent estimate of the local dark matter (DM) density. The velocity distribution of the DM particles near the Sun is very non-Gaussian. All three principal velocity dispersions are boosted as the halo contracts, and at low velocities a plateau develops in the distribution of vz. For models similar to a state-of-the-art Galaxy model, we find velocity dispersions around 180 km s−1 for vz and the tangential velocity, vφ, and 150–205 km s−1 for the in-plane radial velocity, vR, depending on the anisotropy of the model.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208189","methods: analytical;Galaxy: halo;Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics;Galaxy: structure;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Very little work has so far been performed using radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), and there is no consensus on the importance of radiation feedback in galaxy evolution. We present RHD simulations of isolated galaxy discs of different masses with a resolution of 18 pc. Besides accounting for supernova feedback, our simulations are the first galaxy-scale simulations to include RHD treatments of photoionization heating and radiation pressure, from both direct optical/UV radiation and multiscattered, re-processed infrared (IR) radiation. Photoheating smooths and thickens the discs and suppresses star formation about as much as the inclusion of (‘thermal dump’) supernova feedback does. These effects decrease with galaxy mass and are mainly due to the prevention of the formation of dense clouds, as opposed to their destruction. Radiation pressure, whether from direct or IR radiation, has little effect, but for the IR radiation we show that its impact is limited by our inability to resolve the high optical depths for which multiscattering becomes important. While artificially boosting the IR optical depths does reduce the star formation, it does so by smoothing the gas rather than by generating stronger outflows. We conclude that although higher resolution simulations, and potentially also different supernova implementations, are needed for confirmation, our findings suggest that radiation feedback is more gentle and less effective than is often assumed in subgrid prescriptions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208188","radiative transfer;methods: numerical;galaxies: evolution","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In addition, we take into account the gas content of both galaxies deriving the H I+He rotation curve. The deduced baryonic rotation curves (star+gas) are inadequate to account for the total mass of UGC 4284 and UGC 11861, for that reason we examine the possibility of dark matter (DM) to explain the incongruity between the observed H I and H α rotation curves of UGC 4284 and UGC 11861 and the derived baryonic rotation curves. We consider NFW, Burkert, DiCintio, Einasto, and the Stadel DM haloes, to analyse the DM content of UGC 4284 and UGC 11861. The principal results of this work are that cored DM models better reproduce the DM H α and H I rotation curves of UGC 11861 and the DM H I rotation curve of UGC 4284, while the H α rotation curve of UGC 4284 is better reproduced by a cuspy DiCintio DM model. In general, cored exponential two-parameter models Einasto and Stadel give better fits than Burkert. This trend, as well as to confirm past results, presents for the first time a comparison between two different exponential DM models, Einasto and Stadel, in an attempt to better constrain the range of possible exponential DM models applied to real galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208169","galaxies: individual: UGC 11861;galaxies: individual: UGC 4284;galaxies: irregular;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use this curious combination of a close low-mass disc and a wide planet to motivate our simulations of this system. We study the parameter space of the initial conditions to quantify the mass loss from the debris disc and its lifetime under the influence of the planet. We find that when the planet orbits closer to the star than about 50 au and with low inclination relative to the disc (less than about 10°), more disc material is perturbed outside than inside the region constrained by observations on time-scales shorter than 1 Myr. Considering the age of the system, such a short lifetime of the disc is incompatible with the time-scale for planet–planet scattering, which is one of the scenarios suggested to explain the wide separation of the planet. For some configurations, when the planet orbit is inclined with respect to the disc, the latter will start to wobble. We argue that this wobbling is caused by a mechanism similar to Kozai–Lidov oscillations. We also observe various resonant structures (such as rings and spiral arms) induced in the disc by the planet.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208171","celestial mechanics;planets and satellites: formation;planets and satellites: individual: HD 106906 b;planet–disc interactions;circumstellar matter;open clusters and associations: individual: Lower Centaurus Crux","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The correlation between 5 GHz and X-ray luminosities of RQ AGN, which follows LR = 10−5LX observed also in stellar coronae, suggests an association of both X-ray and radio sources with the accretion disc corona. Observing RQ AGN at higher (mm-wave) frequencies, where synchrotron self-absorption is diminished, and smaller regions can be probed, is key to exploring this association. Eight RQ AGN, selected based on their high X-ray brightness and variability, were observed at 95 GHz with the CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimetre-wave Astronomy) and ATCA (the Australia Telescope Compact Array) telescopes. All targets were detected at the 1–10 mJy level. Emission excess at 95 GHz of up to ×7 is found with respect to archival low-frequency steep spectra, suggesting a compact, optically thick core superimposed on the more extended structures that dominate at low frequencies. Though unresolved, the 95 GHz fluxes imply optically thick source sizes of 10−4–10−3 pc, or ∼10–1000 gravitational radii. The present sources lie tightly along an LR (95 GHz) = 10−4LX (2–10 keV) correlation, analogous to that of stellar coronae and RQ AGN at 5 GHz, while RL AGN are shown to have higher LR/LX ratios. The present observations argue that simultaneous mm-wave and X-ray monitoring of RQ AGN features a promising method for understanding accretion disc coronal emission.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208221","galaxies: active;galaxies: jets;galaxies: nuclei;radio continuum: galaxies;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We identify a pre-existing flux rope associated with a sinistral filament, which was observed several days before the event. The confined eruption of the filament within a null-point topology, also known as an Eiffel tower (or inverted-Y) magnetic field configuration results in the formation of a twisted jet after the magnetic reconnection near a null point. The sign of helicity in the jet is found to be the same as that of the sign of helicity in the filament.

We have combined optical to near-infrared line-strength indices in order to infer, out to 1.5 Re, the initial mass function (IMF) of the nearby relic massive galaxy NGC 1277. The IMF of this galaxy is bottom-heavy at all radii, with the fraction of low-mass stars being at least a factor of two larger than that found in the Milky Way. The excess of low-mass stars is present throughout the galaxy, while the velocity dispersion profile shows a strong decrease with radius. This behaviour suggests that local velocity dispersion is not the only driver of the observed IMF variations seen among nearby early-type galaxies. In addition, the excess of low-mass stars shown in NGC 1277 could reflect the effect on the IMF of dramatically different and intense star formation processes at z ∼ 2, compared to the less extreme conditions observed in the local Universe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208153","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: fundamental parameters","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By stacking only short frame-time observations to limit pileup, and after subtracting the nuclear point spread function, we analysed the X-ray gas properties within the Bondi radius at 0.12-0.22 kpc (1.5-2.8 arcsec), depending on the black hole mass. Within 2 kpc radius, we detect two significant temperature components, which are consistent with constant values of 2 and 0.9 keV down to 0.15 kpc radius. No evidence was found for the expected temperature increase within ∼ 0.25 kpc due to the influence of the SMBH. Within the Bondi radius, the density profile is consistent with ρ ∝ r−1. The lack of a temperature increase inside the Bondi radius suggests that the hot gas structure is not dictated by the SMBH's potential and, together with the shallow density profile, shows that the classical Bondi rate may not reflect the accretion rate on to the SMBH. If this density profile extends in towards the SMBH, the mass accretion rate on to the SMBH could be at least two orders of magnitude less than the Bondi rate, which agrees with Faraday rotation measurements for M87. We discuss the evidence for outflow from the hot gas and the cold gas disc and for cold feedback, where gas cooling rapidly from the hot atmosphere could feed the cirumnuclear disc and fuel the SMBH. At 0.2 kpc radius, the cooler X-ray temperature component represents ∼20 per cent of the total X-ray gas mass and, by losing angular momentum to the hot gas component, could provide a fuel source of cold clouds within the Bondi radius.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208198","galaxies: clusters: individual: M87;intergalactic medium;X-rays: galaxies: clusters","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use a combination of archival narrow-band NB921 data in UDS and new NB921 measurements in SA22 and COSMOS/UltraVISTA, all observed with the Subaru telescope, with a total area of ∼5 deg2. We exclude lower redshift interlopers by using broad-band optical and near-infrared photometry and also exclude three supernovae with data split over multiple epochs. Combining the UDS and COSMOS samples, we find no evolution of the bright end of the Lyα LF between z = 5.7 and 6.6, which is supported by spectroscopic follow-up, and conclude that sources with Himiko-like luminosity are not as rare as previously thought, with number densities of ∼1.5 × 10−5 Mpc−3. Combined with our wide-field SA22 measurements, our results indicate a non-Schechter-like bright end of the LF at z = 6.6 and a different evolution of observed faint and bright LAEs, overcoming cosmic variance. This differential evolution is also seen in the spectroscopic follow-up of UV-selected galaxies and is now also confirmed for LAEs, and we argue that it may be an effect of reionization. Using a toy model, we show that such differential evolution of the LF is expected, since brighter sources are able to ionize their surroundings earlier, such that Lyα photons are able to escape. Our targets are excellent candidates for detailed follow-up studies and provide the possibility to give a unique view on the earliest stages in the formation of galaxies and reionization process.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208192","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: high-redshift;cosmology: observations;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this context, we have studied the physical properties of disc galaxies without classical bulges in comparison to those with classical bulges since z ∼ 0.9. Using images from the Hubble Space Telescope and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we have computed both parametric and non-parametric measures, and examined the evolution in size, concentration, stellar mass, effective stellar mass density and asymmetry. We find that both disc galaxies with and without classical bulges have gained more than 50 per cent of their present stellar mass over the last ∼8 Gyr. Also, the increase in disc size is found to be peripheral. While the average total (Petrosian) radius almost doubles from z ∼ 0.9 to z ∼ 0, the average effective radius undergoes a marginal increase in comparison. Additionally, increase in the density of the inner region is evident through the evolution of both concentration and effective stellar mass density. We find that the asymmetry index falls from higher to lower redshifts, but this is more pronounced for the bulgeless disc sample. Also, asymmetry correlates with the global effective radius, and concentration correlates with the global Sérsic index, but better so for higher redshifts only. The substantial increase in mass and size indicates that accretion of external material has been a dominant mode of galaxy growth, where the circumgalactic environment plays a significant role.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208185","galaxies: bulges;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using 70 months of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations, a likelihood analysis of all 1–300 GeV photons within 5° of the track-like neutrino candidates’ origin was undertaken, to search for spatially coincident γ-ray emission. One of IceCube's HESE (High Energy Starting Event) track events was found to be spatially coincident with a γ-ray bright active galactic nucleus (AGN), PKS 0723-008. We find however that the chance probability for Fermi-LAT detected AGN to be spatially coincident with a single HESE track-like event is high (∼37 per cent). We therefore find no evidence of γ-ray emission associated with the detection of IceCube's HESE track-like neutrino candidates. Upper limits were calculated in the energy range of 1–300 GeV, assuming a point source origin for the neutrino events considered. The implications for the non-detection of γ-ray emission from the source of the HESE track-like events are briefly discussed. The large time period analysed in our study did however reveal two new γ-ray point sources. With a flux of (1.28 ± 0.08) × 10−9 photons cm−2 s−1, in the 1–300 GeV energy range, and an associated TS value of 220.6, one of these new point sources is positionally coincident with the AGN PKS 1346-112.

As a result, the standard interpretations of many galaxy observables (which assume a slowly varying SFH) are often incorrect. Here, we use the SFHs from hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the effects of bursty SFHs on sample selection and interpretation of observables and make predictions to confirm such SFHs in future surveys. First, because dwarf galaxies’ star formation rates change rapidly, the mass-to-light ratio is also changing rapidly in both the ionizing continuum and, to a lesser extent, the non-ionizing ultraviolet continuum. Therefore, flux limited surveys are highly biased towards selecting galaxies in the burst phase and very deep observations are required to detect all dwarf galaxies at a given stellar mass. Second, we show that a log10[νLν(1500 Å)/LHα] > 2.5 implies a very recent quenching of star formation and can be used as evidence of stellar feedback regulating star formation. Third, we show that the ionizing continuum can be significantly higher than when assuming a constant SFH, which can affect the interpretation of nebular emission line equivalent widths and direct ionizing continuum detections. Finally, we show that a star formation rate estimate based on continuum measurements only (and not on nebular tracers such as the hydrogen Balmer lines) will not trace the rapid changes in star formation and will give the false impression of a star-forming main sequence with low dispersion.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208146","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: starburst","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A two-step approach is adopted. (i) The ANN network must be trained with a subset of objects that are known to be active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosts, composites or star-forming galaxies, treating the strong emission-line flux measurements as input feature vectors in n-dimensional space, where n is the number of strong emission-line flux ratios. (ii) After the network is trained on a sample of galaxies, the remaining galaxies are classified in the automatic test analysis as AGN hosts, composites or star-forming galaxies. We show that the classification diagrams based on the [N II]/Hα versus other emission-line ratio, such as [O III]/Hβ, [Ne III]/[O II], ([O III]λ4959 + [O III]λ5007)/[O III]λ4363, [O II]/Hβ, [Ar III]/[O III], [S II]/Hα, and [O I]/Hα, plus colour, allows us to separate unambiguously AGN hosts, composites or star-forming galaxies. Among them, the diagram of [N II]/Hα versus [O III]/Hβ achieved an accuracy of 98 per cent for classification of AGN hosts, composites or star-forming galaxies. The other diagrams above except the diagram of [N II]/Hα versus [O III]/Hβ give an accuracy of ∼90 per cent.

Antlia is the third nearest populous galaxy cluster after Fornax and Virgo (d ∼ 35 Mpc). A photographic catalogue of its galaxy content was built by Ferguson & Sandage in 1990 (FS90). Afterwards, we performed further analysis of the ETG population located at the cluster centre. Now, we extend our study covering an area four times larger, calculating new total magnitudes and colours, instead of isophotal photometry, as well as structural parameters obtained through Sérsic model fits extrapolated to infinity. This work involves a total of 177 ETGs, out of them 56 per cent have been catalogued by FS90 while the rest (77 galaxies) are newly discovered ones. Medium-resolution GEMINI and Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectra are used to confirm membership when available. Including radial velocities from the literature, 59 ETGs are confirmed as Antlia members. Antlia scaling relations mainly support the existence of unique functions (linear and curved) that join bright and dwarf ETGs, excluding compact ellipticals (cEs). Lenticular galaxies are outliers only with respect to the curved relation derived for effective surface brightness versus absolute magnitude. The small number of bright ellipticals and cEs present in Antlia, prevents us from testing if the same data can be fitted with two different linear sequences, for bright and dwarf ETGs. However, adding data from other clusters and groups, the existence of such sequences is also noticeable in the same scaling relations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208182","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: clusters: individual: Antlia;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: fundamental parameters","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have analysed two archival Very Large Array monitorings, all the available archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data and a coordinated quasi-simultaneous observational campaign conducted in 2013 with Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. The data show that the radio emission of LS 5039 is persistent on day, week and year time-scales, with a variability ≲ 25 per cent at all frequencies, and no signature of orbital modulation. The obtained spectra reveal a power-law shape with a curvature below 5 GHz and a turnover at ∼0.5GHz, which can be reproduced by a one-zone model with synchrotron self-absorption plus Razin effect. We obtain a coherent picture for the size of the emitting region of ∼0.85 mas, setting a magnetic field of B ∼ 20 mG, an electron density of ne ∼ 4 × 105 cm−3 and a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M}\sim 5\times 10^{-8} \,\mathrm{M_{\odot }\, yr^{-1}}$. These values imply a significant mixing of the stellar wind with the relativistic plasma outflow from the compact companion. At particular epochs the Razin effect is negligible, implying changes in the injection and the electron density or magnetic field. The Razin effect is reported for the first time in a gamma-ray binary, giving further support to the young non-accreting pulsar scenario.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208190","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;instrumentation: interferometers;binaries: close;stars: individual: LS 5039;gamma rays: stars;radio continuum: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

From the one-point statistics of the fluctuations, such as variance and skewness, we find that the peaks and dips in the time evolution are deeply related to X-ray heating of the intergalactic gas, which controls the spin temperature.

We calculate the acceleration of a mixed composition of cosmic rays at Gamma-ray burst (GRB) internal shocks, taking into account the relevant energy loss processes. 3D trajectories during the relativistic Fermi cycles are simulated following previous works by Niemiec & Ostrowski. We use the internal shock model of Daigne & Mochkovitch to derive the evolution of the relevant physical quantities (magnetic fields, baryon and photon densities, shock velocity). We consider different phenomenological hypotheses about the sharing of the dissipated energy between accelerated cosmic rays, electrons and the magnetic field. For various choices of the parameters, we calculate the spectrum of cosmic rays escaping from the GRB environment as well as secondary particles produced either during the acceleration or extragalactic propagation of UHECRs. Only models where (i) the prompt emission represents only a small fraction of the energy dissipated at internal shocks and (ii) most of this dissipated energy is communicated to cosmic rays, are able to reproduce the magnitude of the UHECR flux observed on Earth. For these models, however, the observed shape of the UHECR spectrum can be well reproduced above the ankle, with an evolution of the composition compatible with the trend suggested by Auger, and associated diffuse fluxes of secondary particles which do not violate current observational limits.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208172","acceleration of particles;gamma-ray burst: general;cosmic rays","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To understand this discrepancy, it is of crucial importance to obtain ground-based spectroscopic observations of Am stars in the Kepler and K2 fields in order to determine the best estimates of the stellar parameters. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of high-resolution spectroscopic data for seven stars previously classified as Am stars. We determine the effective temperatures, surface gravities, projected rotational velocities, microturbulent velocities and chemical abundances of these stars using spectral synthesis.

Geers",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","1","26","33","ISO-Oph-50 is a young low-mass object in the ∼1 Myr old Ophiuchus star-forming region undergoing dramatic changes in its optical/near/mid-infrared brightness by 2–4 mag. We present new multi-band photometry and near-infrared spectra, combined with a synopsis of the existing literature data. Based on the spectroscopy, the source is confirmed as a mid-M dwarf, with evidence for ongoing accretion. The near-infrared light curves show large-scale variations, with 2–4 mag amplitude in the bands IJHK, with the object generally being bluer when faint. Near its brightest state, the object shows colour changes consistent with variable extinction of ΔAV ∼ 7 mag. High-cadence monitoring at 3.6 μm reveals quasi-periodic variations with a typical time-scale of 1–2 weeks. The best explanation for these characteristics is a low-mass star seen through circumstellar matter, whose complex variability is caused by changing inhomogeneities in the inner parts of the disc. When faint, the direct stellar emission is blocked; the near-infrared radiation is dominated by scattered light. When bright, the emission is consistent with a photosphere strongly reddened by circumstellar dust. Based on the available constraints, the inhomogeneities have to be located at or beyond ∼0.1 au distance from the star. If this scenario turns out to be correct, a major portion of the inner disc has to be clumpy, structured, and/or in turmoil. In its observational characteristics, this object resembles other types of young stellar objects with variability caused in the inner disc. Compared to other objects, however, ISO-Oph-50 is clearly an extreme case, given the large amplitude of the brightness and colour changes combined with the erratic behaviour. ISO-Oph-50 has been near its brightest state since 2013; further monitoring is highly encouraged.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208164","accretion, accretion discs;stars: activity;brown dwarfs;stars: low-mass;stars: pre-main-sequence","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Díaz",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","451","1","888","903","This work investigates the main mechanism(s) that regulate the specific star formation rate (SSFR) in nearby galaxies, cross-correlating two proxies of this quantity – the equivalent width of the Hα line and the (u − r) colour – with other physical properties (mass, metallicity, environment, morphology, and the presence of close companions) in a sample of ∼82 500 galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The existence of a relatively tight ‘ageing sequence’ in the colour–equivalent width plane favours a scenario where the secular conversion of gas into stars (i.e. nature) is the main physical driver of the instantaneous SSFR and the gradual transition from a ‘chemically primitive’ (metal-poor and intensely star-forming) state to a ‘chemically evolved’ (metal-rich and passively evolving) system. Nevertheless, environmental factors (i.e. nurture) are also important. In the field, galaxies may be temporarily affected by discrete ‘quenching’ and ‘rejuvenation’ episodes, but such events show little statistical significance in a probabilistic sense, and we find no evidence that galaxy interactions are, on average, a dominant driver of star formation. Although visually classified mergers tend to display systematically higher EW(Hα) and bluer (u − r) colours for a given luminosity, most galaxies with high SSFR have uncertain morphologies, which could be due to either internal or external processes. Field galaxies of early and late morphological types are consistent with the gradual ‘ageing’ scenario, with no obvious signatures of a sudden decrease in their SSFR. In contrast, star formation is significantly reduced and sometimes completely quenched on a short time-scale in dense environments, where many objects are found on a ‘quenched sequence’ in the colour–equivalent width plane.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208194","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the physical origin of the mechanism driving the observed outflows, whether due to energy-driving or radiation-driving, is still debated; and in some cases, it is not clear whether the central source is an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a nuclear starburst. Here, we study the role of radiation pressure on dust in driving galactic-scale AGN outflows, and analyse the dynamics of the outflowing shell as a function of the underlying physical parameters. We show that high-velocity outflows (≳1000 km s−1) with large momentum flux (≳10 L/c) can be obtained, by taking into account the effects of radiation trapping. In particular, the high observed values of the momentum boosts can be reproduced, provided that the shell is initially optically thick to the reprocessed infrared radiation. Alternatively, the inferred measurements of the momentum flux may be significantly biased by AGN variability. In this context, the observations of powerful outflows on kiloparsec scales, with no or weak signs of ongoing nuclear activity at the present time, could be re-interpreted as relics of past AGN episodes.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208191","black hole physics;radiation: dynamics;galaxies: active;galaxies: evolution","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

I compare the simulation results to observations of the incidence frequency of LLSs and the H I column density distribution function over the redshift range z = 2–5 and find good agreement. I explore the connection between LLSs and their host haloes and find that LLSs reside in haloes with a wide range of halo masses with a nearly constant covering fraction within a virial radius. Over the range z = 2–5, I find that more than half of the LLSs reside in haloes with M < 1010 h−1 M⊙, indicating that absorption line studies of LLSs can probe these low-mass galaxies which H2-based star formation models predict to have very little star formation. I study the physical state of individual LLSs and test a simple model which encapsulates many of their properties. I confirm that LLSs have a characteristic absorption length given by the Jeans length and that they are in photoionization equilibrium at low column densities. Finally, I investigate the self-shielding of LLSs to the UVB and explore how the non-sphericity of LLSs affects the photoionization rate at a given $N_{\rm H\,\small {I}}$. I find that at z ≈ 3, LLSs have an optical depth of unity at a column density of ∼1018 cm−2 and that this is the column density which characterizes the onset of self-shielding.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208217","methods: numerical;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;quasars: absorption lines","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here, we exploit this to estimate and compare root-mean-square velocities for a large sample of nuclear star clusters and their host (late- or early-type) galaxies. Traditional observables, such as the radial surface brightness and second-order velocity moment profiles, are subject to short-term variations due to individual episodes of matter infall and/or star formation. The total mass, energy and angular momentum, on the other hand, are approximately conserved. Thus, the total energy and angular momentum more directly probe the formation of galaxies and their nuclear star clusters, by offering access to more fundamental properties of the nuclear cluster–galaxy system than traditional observables. We find that there is a strong correlation, in fact a near equality, between the root-mean-square velocity of a nuclear star cluster and that of its host. Thus, the energy per unit mass of a nuclear star cluster is always comparable to that of its host galaxy. We interpret this as evidence that nuclear star clusters do not form independently of their host galaxies, but rather that their formation and subsequent evolution are coupled. We discuss how our results can potentially be used to offer a clear and observationally testable prediction to distinguish between the different nuclear star cluster formation scenarios, and/or quantify their relative contributions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208149","methods: statistical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: nuclei;galaxies: photometry","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our analysis focuses on stellar rotation curves derived by fitting stellar template spectra to the galaxy spectra binned along the slit. In this way, we are able to obtain accurate rotation velocity measurements for a factor of 2 more galaxies than possible with the Hα line. Galaxies with high atomic gas mass fractions are the most dark-matter-dominated galaxies in our sample and have dark matter halo density profiles that are to first order well described by Navarro–Frenk–White profiles with an average concentration parameter of 10. The inner slopes of the rotation curves correlate more strongly with stellar population age than with galaxy mass or structural parameters. At fixed stellar mass, the rotation curves of more actively star-forming galaxies have steeper inner slopes than less actively star-forming galaxies. The ratio between the galaxy specific angular momentum and the total specific angular momentum of its dark matter halo, Rj, correlates strongly with galaxy mass, structure and gas content. Low-mass, disc-dominated galaxies with atomic gas mass fractions greater than 20 per cent have median values of Rj of around 1, but massive, bulge-dominated galaxies have Rj = 0.2–0.3. We argue that these trends can be understood in a picture where gas inflows triggered by disc instabilities lead to the formation of passive, bulge-dominated galaxies with low specific angular momentum.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208150","galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: stellar content;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The pdf shape can be fitted by a combination of a lognormal function and an extended power-law tail at high densities, in zones centred at the molecular cloud Perseus. A linear combination of several lognormals fits very well the pdf in rings surrounding the cloud or in zones of its diffuse neighbourhood. The slope of the mean-density scaling law 〈ρ 〉 L∝Lα is steep (α = −1.93) in the former case and rather shallow (α = −0.77 ± 0.11) in the rings delineated around the cloud. We interpret these findings as signatures of two distinct physical regimes: (i) a gravoturbulent one which is characterized by nearly linear scaling of mass and practical lack of velocity scaling; and (ii) a predominantly turbulent one which is best described by steep velocity scaling and by invariant for compressible turbulence $\langle \rho \rangle _L u_L^3/L$, describing a scale-independent flux of the kinetic energy per unit volume through turbulent cascade.

We have cross-matched to sources in the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogue so that for all stars individually determined near-infrared (NIR) photometry is available on a homogeneous system (typically Ks). The spatial completeness of the sample has been carefully determined by statistical methods, and the NIR LF of the stars has been derived by direct star counts. We find a local volume luminosity of 0.121 ± 0.004 LK⊙ pc−3, corresponding to a volumetric mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of $M/L_K = 0.31 \pm 0.02\,{\mathcal {M}}_{\odot }/L_{K\odot }$, where giants contribute 80 per cent to the light but less than 2 per cent to the stellar mass. We derive the surface brightness of the solar cylinder with the help of a vertical disc model. We find a surface brightness of 99 LK⊙ pc−2 with an uncertainty of approximately 10 per cent. This corresponds to an M/L for the solar cylinder of $M/L_K = 0.34\,{\mathcal {M}}_{\odot }/L_{K\odot }$. The M/L for the solar cylinder is only 10 per cent larger than the local value despite the fact that the local population has a much larger contribution of young stars. It turns out that the effective scaleheights of the lower main sequence carrying most of the mass is similar to that of the giants, which are dominating the NIR light. The corresponding colour for the solar cylinder is V − K = 2.89 mag compared to the local value of V − K = 2.46 mag. An extrapolation of the local surface brightness to the whole Milky Way yields a total luminosity of MK = −24.2 mag.

In this paper, we develop a formalism to calculate the bispectrum contributed from the thermal noise taking array configuration of telescopes into account, by extending a formalism for the power spectrum. We apply our formalism to the ongoing and future telescopes such as expanded Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We find that expanded MWA does not have enough sensitivity to detect the bispectrum signal.

In f (R) gravity, dark matter void abundances are greater than that of general relativity (GR). Differences for halo void abundances are much smaller, but still at the 2σ, 6σ and 14σ level for the f (R) model parameter |fR0| = 10−6, 10−5 and 10−4. Counter-intuitively, the abundance of large voids found using haloes in f (R) gravity is lower, which suggests that voids are not necessarily emptier of galaxies in this model. We find the halo number density profiles of voids are not distinguishable from GR, but the same voids are emptier of dark matter in f (R) gravity. This can be observed by weak gravitational lensing of voids, for which the combination of a spec-z and a photo-z survey over the same sky is necessary. For a volume of 1 (Gpc h−1)3, |fR0| = 10−5 and 10−4 may be distinguished from GR at 4σ and 8σ using the lensing tangential shear signal around voids. Sample variance and line-of-sight projection effect sets limits for constraining |fR0| = 10−6. This might be overcome with a larger volume. The smaller halo void abundance and the stronger lensing shear signal of voids in f (R) models may be combined to break the degeneracy between |fR0| and σ8. The outflow of dark matter from void centres are 5, 15 and 35 per cent faster in f (R) gravity for |fR0| = 10−6, 10−5 and 10−4.

Future large-scale photometric surveys such as Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Euclid will be vital to gain insight into the evolution of galaxy properties and the role of environment. Large samples come at the cost of redshift precision and this affects the measurement of environment. We study this by measuring environments using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic and photometric redshifts and also simulated photometric redshifts with a range of uncertainties. We consider the Nth nearest neighbour and fixed aperture methods and evaluate the impact of the aperture parameters and the redshift uncertainty. We find that photometric environments have a smaller dynamic range than spectroscopic measurements because uncertain redshifts scatter galaxies from dense environments into less dense environments. At the expected redshift uncertainty of DES, 0.1, there is Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.4 between the measurements using the optimal parameters. We examine the galaxy red fraction as a function of mass and environment using photometric redshifts and find that the bivariate dependence is still present in the SDSS photometric measurements. We show that photometric samples with a redshift uncertainty of 0.1 must be approximately 6–16 times larger than spectroscopic samples to detect environment correlations with equivalent fractional errors.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208230","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: photometry;galaxies: statistics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We extend these to include ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The MHD equations are second-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a divergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains $\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol B}\approx 0$. We implement these in the code GIZMO, together with state-of-the-art SPH MHD. We consider a large test suite, and show that on all problems the new methods are competitive with AMR using constrained transport (CT) to ensure $\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol B}=0$. They correctly capture the growth/structure of the magnetorotational instability, MHD turbulence, and launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than state-of-the-art AMR. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit convergence at fixed neighbour number, sharp shock-capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, divergence errors, and diffusion. Still, ‘modern’ SPH can handle most test problems, at the cost of larger kernels and ‘by hand’ adjustment of artificial diffusion. Compared to non-moving meshes, the new methods exhibit enhanced ‘grid noise’ but reduced advection errors and diffusion, easily include self-gravity, and feature velocity-independent errors and superior angular momentum conservation. They converge more slowly on some problems (smooth, slow-moving flows), but more rapidly on others (involving advection/rotation). In all cases, we show divergence control beyond the Powell 8-wave approach is necessary, or all methods can converge to unphysical answers even at high resolution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198423","hydrodynamics;instabilities;turbulence;methods: numerical;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The northern part of the front appears the sharpest, with a width smaller than 2.5 kpc (1.5 Coulomb mean free paths; at 99 per cent confidence). Everywhere along the front, the temperature discontinuity is narrower than 4–8 kpc and the metallicity gradient is narrower than 6 kpc, indicating that diffusion, conduction and mixing are suppressed across the interface. Such transport processes can be naturally suppressed by magnetic fields aligned with the cold front. Interestingly, comparison to magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicates that in order to maintain the observed sharp density and temperature discontinuities, conduction must also be suppressed along the magnetic field lines. However, the northwestern part of the cold front is observed to have a non-zero width. While other explanations are possible, the broadening is consistent with the presence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) on length-scales of a few kpc. Based on comparison with simulations, the presence of KHI would imply that the effective viscosity of the intracluster medium is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude with respect to the isotropic Spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity. Underneath the cold front, we observe quasi-linear features that are ∼10 per cent brighter than the surrounding gas and are separated by ∼15 kpc from each other in projection. Comparison to tailored numerical simulations suggests that the observed phenomena may be due to the amplification of magnetic fields by gas sloshing in wide layers below the cold front, where the magnetic pressure reaches ∼5–10 per cent of the thermal pressure, reducing the gas density between the bright features.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198489","hydrodynamics;instabilities;galaxies: clusters: individual: Virgo;galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium;X-rays: galaxies: clusters","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We took data on 23 nights at three observatories, one in India and two in Bulgaria, making quasi-simultaneous observations in B, V, R, and I bands. We measured multiband optical fluxes, colour, and spectral variations for this blazar on intraday and short time-scales. The source was in a flaring state during the period analysed and displayed intense variability in all wavelengths. R-band magnitude of 11.6 was attained by the target on 2015 January 18, which is the brightest value ever recorded for S5 0716+714. The discrete correlation function method yielded good correlation between the bands with no measurable time lags, implying that radiation in these bands originate from the same region and by the same mechanism. We also used the structure function technique to look for characteristic time-scales in the light curves. During the times of rapid variability, no evidence for the source to display spectral changes with magnitude was found on either of the time-scales. The amplitude of variations tends to increase with increasing frequency with a maximum of ∼22 per cent seen during flaring states in B band. A mild trend of larger variability amplitude as the source brightens was also found. We found the duty cycle of our source during the analysed period to be ∼90 per cent. We also investigated the optical spectral energy distribution of S5 0716+714 using B, V, R, and I data points for 21 nights.

It has been proposed that there is a star on an eccentric orbit around the black hole which transfers mass at pericentre. To investigate the orbital evolution of this system, we perform stellar evolution simulations using MESA and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of a stellar orbit around an intermediate-mass black hole using FI. We run and couple these simulations using the AMUSE framework. We find that mass is lost through both the first and second Lagrange points and that there is a delay of up to 10 d between the pericentre passage and the peak mass-loss event. The orbital evolution time-scales we find in our simulations are larger than what is predicted by analytical models, but these models fall within the errors of our results. Despite the fast orbital evolution, we are unable to reproduce the observed change in outburst period. We conclude that the change in the stellar orbit, with the system parameters investigated here, is unable to account for all observed features of HLX-1.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198461","hydrodynamics;methods: numerical;binaries: close;stars: kinematics and dynamics;X-rays: binaries;X-rays: individual (HLX-1)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Krumholz",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","334","342","We show that the turbulent gas in the star-forming regions of galaxies is unstable to wind formation via momentum deposition by radiation pressure or other momentum sources like supernova explosions, even if the system is below the average Eddington limit. This conclusion follows from the fact that the critical momentum injection rate per unit mass for unbinding gas from a self-gravitating system is proportional to the gas surface density and that a turbulent medium presents a broad distribution of column densities to the sources. For an average Eddington ratio of 〈Γ〉 ≃ 0.1 and for turbulent Mach numbers ≳ 30, we find that ∼1 per cent of the gas is ejected per dynamical time-scale at velocities larger than the local escape velocity. Because of the lognormal shape of the surface density distribution, the mass-loss rate is highly sensitive to the average Eddington ratio, reaching ∼20–40 per cent of the gas mass per dynamical time for 〈Γ〉 ≃ 1. Using this model we find a large scatter in the mass-loading factor for star-forming galaxies, ranging from ∼10−3–10, but with significant uncertainties. Implications for the efficiency of star formation in giant molecular clouds are highlighted. For radiation pressure feedback alone, we find an increasing star formation efficiency as a function of initial gas surface density.

Arca-Sedda",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","35","50","During their evolution, star clusters undergo mass segregation, by which the orbits of the most massive stars shrink, while the lighter stars move outwards from the cluster centre. In this context, recent observations and dynamical modelling of several galactic and extragalactic globular clusters (GCs) suggest that most of them show, close to their centre, an overabundance of mass whose nature is still matter of debate. For instance, many works show that orbitally segregated stars may collide with each other in a runaway fashion, leading to the formation of a very massive star or an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass comparable to the observed mass excess. On the other hand, segregated stars can form a dense system if the IMBH formation fails. In this paper we study the early formation phase of a dense, massive subsystem (MSS) in several GCs models using a recently developed semi-analytical treatment of the mass segregation process. In order to investigate how the MSS properties depend on the host cluster properties, we varied initial mass function (IMF), total mass, spatial distribution and metallicity of our models. Our results show how the IMF contributes to determine the final mass of the MSS, while the metallicity and the spatial distribution play a minor role. The method presented in this paper allowed us to provide scaling relations that connect the MSS mass and the host cluster mass in agreement with the observed correlation. In order to follow the early formation stage of the MSSs and improve our statistical results, we performed several N-body simulations of stellar clusters with masses between 103 and 2 × 105 M⊙.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198434","black hole physics;stars: evolution;stars: kinematics and dynamics;globular clusters: general;galaxies: star clusters: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Building on the Hoffman–Ribak algorithm, we start from a reference simulation with fully random initial conditions, then make controlled changes to specific properties of a single halo (such as its mass and merger history). The algorithm demonstrably makes minimal changes to other properties of the halo and its environment, allowing us to isolate the impact of a given modification. As a significant improvement over previous work, we are able to calculate the abundance of the resulting objects relative to the reference simulation. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of cosmic structures and epochs; here we study two problems as a proof of concept. First, we investigate the change in density profile and concentration as the collapse times of three individual haloes are varied at fixed final mass, showing good agreement with previous statistical studies using large simulation suites. Secondly, we modify the z = 0 mass of haloes to show that our theoretical abundance calculations correctly recover the halo mass function. The results demonstrate that the technique is robust, opening the way to controlled experiments in galaxy formation using hydrodynamic zoom simulations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198494","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, it has been argued that the strong ejecta asymmetries produced by this model might be inconsistent with the low degree of polarization typically observed in Type Ia supernova explosions. Here, we test this claim by carrying out a spectropolarimetric analysis for the model proposed by Pakmor et al. for an explosion triggered during the merger of a 1.1 and 0.9 M⊙ carbon–oxygen white dwarf binary system. Owing to the asymmetries of the ejecta, the polarization signal varies significantly with viewing angle. We find that polarization levels for observers in the equatorial plane are modest (≲1 per cent) and show clear evidence for a dominant axis, as a consequence of the ejecta symmetry about the orbital plane. In contrast, orientations out of the plane are associated with higher degrees of polarization and departures from a dominant axis. While the particular model studied here gives a good match to highly polarized events such as SN 2004dt, it has difficulties in reproducing the low polarization levels commonly observed in normal Type Ia supernovae. Specifically, we find that significant asymmetries in the element distribution result in a wealth of strong polarization features that are not observed in the majority of currently available spectropolarimetric data of Type Ia supernovae. Future studies will map out the parameter space of the merger scenario to investigate if alternative models can provide better agreement with observations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198499","hydrodynamics;polarization;radiative transfer;methods: numerical;supernovae: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This allows us to estimate the rate expected in the horizon of the gravitational wave detectors advanced Virgo and advanced LIGO and to compare those rates with independent predictions. In this context, the rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, can be used as a constraint assuming NSM is the main astrophysical site for this nucleosynthetic process. We compute the early cosmic evolution of a typical r-process element, europium. Eu yields from NSM are taken from recent nucleosynthesis calculations. The same approach allows us to compute the cosmic rate of Core-Collapse SuperNovae (CCSNe) and the associated evolution of Eu. We find that the bulk of Eu observations at [Fe/H] > −2.5 can be rather well fitted by either CCSN or NSM scenarios. However, at lower metallicity, the early Eu cosmic evolution favours NSM as the main astrophysical site for the r-process. A comparison between our calculations and spectroscopic observations at very low metallicities allows us to constrain the coalescence time-scale in the NSM scenario to ∼0.1–0.2 Gyr. These values are in agreement with the coalescence time-scales of some observed binary pulsars. Finally, the cosmic evolution of Eu is used to put constraints on (i) the NSM rate, (ii) the merger rate in the horizon of the gravitational wave detectors advanced Virgo/ad LIGO, as well as (iii) the expected rate of electromagnetic counterparts to mergers (‘kilonovae’) in large near-infrared surveys.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198447","gravitational waves;stars: neutron;supernovae: general;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

SIDRA is a detection and classification algorithm based on the Machine Learning technique (Random Forest). The goal of this paper is to show the power of SIDRA for quick and accurate signal detection and classification. We first diagnose the power of the method with simulated light curves and try it on a subset of the Kepler space mission catalogue. We use five classes of simulated light curves (CONSTANT, TRANSIT, VARIABLE, MLENS and EB for constant light curves, transiting exoplanet, variable, microlensing events and eclipsing binaries, respectively) to analyse the power of the method. The algorithm uses four features in order to classify the light curves. The training sample contains 5000 light curves (1000 from each class) and 50 000 random light curves for testing. The total SIDRAsuccess ratio is ≥90 per cent. Furthermore, the success ratio reaches 95–100 per cent for the CONSTANT, VARIABLE, EB and MLENS classes and 92 per cent for the TRANSIT class with a decision probability of 60 per cent. Because the TRANSIT class is the one which fails the most, we run a simultaneous fit using SIDRA and a Box Least Square (BLS)-based algorithm for searching for transiting exoplanets. As a result, our algorithm detects 7.5 per cent more planets than a classic BLS algorithm, with better results for lower signal-to-noise light curves. SIDRA succeeds to catch 98 per cent of the planet candidates in the Kepler sample and fails for 7 per cent of the false alarms subset. SIDRA promises to be useful for developing a detection algorithm and/or classifier for large photometric surveys such as TESS and PLATO exoplanet future space missions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198472","techniques: photometric;planets and satellites: detection;planets and satellites: fundamental parameters;planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We obtained a fairly well-resolved image of the shell of SN 2011dh, making it one of only six recent supernovae for which resolved images of the ejecta are available. SN 2011dh has a relatively clear shell morphology, being almost circular in outline, although there may be some asymmetry in brightness around the ridge. By fitting a spherical shell model directly to the visibility measurements we determine the angular radius of SN 2011dh's radio emission to be 636 ± 29 μas. At a distance of 7.8 Mpc, this angular radius corresponds to a linear radius of (7.4 ± 0.3) × 1016 cm and an average expansion velocity since the explosion of $19\, 000^{+2800}_{-2400}$ km s−1.

Blue bumps can be produced with an additional column density of static hydrogen as small as $N^{\rm static}_{\rm H\,\small {I}} \ll N^{\rm shell}_{\rm H\,\small {I}}$, and typically occur at roughly the outflow velocity of the shell.

Here, we measure it directly for the first time with seismic ages, using red giants observed by Kepler. We use Strömgren photometry to gauge the selection function of asteroseismic targets, and derive colour and magnitude limits where giants with measured oscillations are representative of the underlying population in the field. Limits in the 2MASS system are also derived. We lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effects independent of Galaxy models. We find that low-mass, i.e. old red giants dominate at increasing Galactic heights, whereas closer to the Galactic plane they exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. Parametrizing this as a vertical gradient returns approximately 4 Gyr kpc−1 for the disc we probe, although with a large dispersion of ages at all heights. The ages of stars show a smooth distribution over the last ≃10 Gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescent evolution for the Milky Way disc since a redshift of about 2. We also find a flat age–metallicity relation for disc stars. Finally, we show how to use secondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity spread, and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing the ageing of the disc.

"A simple phenomenological model for grain clustering in turbulence","P. F. Hopkins",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","89","111","We propose a simple model for density fluctuations of aerodynamic grains, embedded in a turbulent, gravitating gas disc. The model combines a calculation for the behaviour of a group of grains encountering a single turbulent eddy, with a hierarchical approximation of the eddy statistics. This makes analytic predictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain densities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum grain densities reached. We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag time ts, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio $\tilde{\rho }$, strength of turbulence α, and detailed disc properties. We test these against numerical simulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. The simulations agree well with the predictions, spanning ts Ω ∼ 10−4–10, $\tilde{\rho }\sim 0{-}3$, α ∼ 10−10–10−2. Results from ‘turbulent concentration’ simulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case. Vortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grains hierarchically. For small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnover time comparable to the stopping time, but fluctuations are also damped by local gas-grain drift. For large grains, shear and gravity lead to a much broader range of eddy scales driving fluctuations, with most power on the largest scales. The grain density distribution has a log-Poisson shape, with fluctuations for large grains up to factors ≳1000. We provide simple analytic expressions for the predictions, and discuss implications for planetesimal formation, grain growth, and the structure of turbulence.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198426","accretion, accretion discs;hydrodynamics;instabilities;turbulence;planets and satellites: formation;protoplanetary discs","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

While constraints on these slopes generally become more challenging at higher redshifts as the UV-continuum shifts out of the Hubble Space Telescope bands (particularly at z > 7), such a characterization actually becomes abruptly easier for galaxies in the redshift window z = 9.5–10.5 due to the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera 3.6 μm-band probing the rest-UV continuum and the long wavelength baseline between this Spitzer band and the Hubble Hf160w band. Higher S/N constraints on β are possible at z ∼ 10 than at z = 8. Here, we take advantage of this opportunity and five recently discovered bright z = 9.5–10.5 galaxies to present the first measurements of the mean β for a multi-object sample of galaxy candidates at z ∼ 10. We find the measured βobs's of these candidates are −2.1 ± 0.3 ± 0.2 (random and systematic), only slightly bluer than the measured β's (βobs ≈ −1.7) at 3.5 < z < 7.5 for galaxies of similar luminosities. Small increases in the stellar ages, metallicities, and dust content of the galaxy population from z ∼ 10 to z ∼ 7 could easily explain the apparent evolution in β.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198432","galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: ISM;ultraviolet: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"An adaptively refined phase–space element method for cosmological simulations and collisionless dynamics","O. Hahn; R. E. Angulo",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","1115","1133","N-body simulations are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe. However, the discrete nature of these simulations affects their accuracy when modelling collisionless systems. We introduce a new approach to simulate the gravitational evolution of cold collisionless fluids by solving the Vlasov–Poisson equations in terms of adaptively refineable ‘Lagrangian phase–space elements’. These geometrical elements are piecewise smooth maps between Lagrangian space and Eulerian phase–space and approximate the continuum structure of the distribution function. They allow for dynamical adaptive splitting to accurately follow the evolution even in regions of very strong mixing. We discuss in detail various one-, two- and three-dimensional test problems to demonstrate the performance of our method. Its advantages compared to N-body algorithms are: (i) explicit tracking of the fine-grained distribution function, (ii) natural representation of caustics, (iii) intrinsically smooth gravitational potential fields, thus (iv) eliminating the need for any type of ad hoc force softening. We show the potential of our method by simulating structure formation in a warm dark matter scenario. We discuss how spurious collisionality and large-scale discreteness noise of N-body methods are both strongly suppressed, which eliminates the artificial fragmentation of filaments. Therefore, we argue that our new approach improves on the N-body method when simulating self-gravitating cold and collisionless fluids, and is the first method that allows us to explicitly follow the fine-grained evolution in six-dimensional phase–space.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198451","methods: numerical;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;cosmology: theory;dark matter;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For this purpose, we identify filamentary structures connecting massive groups of galaxies in the SDSS. We perform a comparative analysis of some properties of galaxies in filaments, in the isotropic infall region, in the field, and in groups. We study the luminosity functions (LF) and the dependence of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) on stellar mass, galaxy type, and projected distance to the groups that define the filaments. We find that the LF of galaxies in filaments and in the isotropic infalling region are basically indistinguishable between them, with the possible exception of late-type galaxies. On the other hand, regardless of galaxy type, their LFs are clearly different from that of field or group galaxies. Both of them have characteristic absolute magnitudes and faint end slopes in between the field and group values. More significant differences between galaxies in filaments and in the isotropic infall region are observed when we analyse the SSFR. We find that galaxies in filaments have a systematically higher fraction of galaxies with low SSFR as a function of both, stellar mass and distance to the groups, indicating a stronger quenching of the star formation in the filaments compared to both, the isotropic infalling region, and the field. Our results suggest that some physical mechanisms that determine the differences observed between field galaxies and galaxies in systems, affect galaxies even when they are not yet within the systems.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198446","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: groups: general;galaxies: luminosity function, mass function;galaxies: star formation;galaxies: statistics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Semelin",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","962","973","The 21-cm forest is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization. The local state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is encoded in the spectrum of a background source (radio-loud quasars or gamma-ray burst afterglow) by absorption at the local 21-cm wavelength, resulting in a continuous and fluctuating absorption level. Small-scale structures (filaments and minihaloes) in the IGM are responsible for the strongest absorption features. The absorption can also be modulated on large scales by inhomogeneous heating and Wouthuysen–Field coupling. We present the results from a simulation that attempts to preserve the cosmological environment while resolving some of the small-scale structures (a few kpc resolution in a 50 h−1 Mpc box). The simulation couples the dynamics and the ionizing radiative transfer and includes X-ray and Lyman lines radiative transfer for a detailed physical modelling. As a result we find that soft X-ray self-shielding, Ly α self-shielding and shock heating all have an impact on the predicted values of the 21-cm optical depth of moderately overdense structures like filaments. A correct treatment of the peculiar velocities is also critical. Modelling these processes seems necessary for accurate predictions and can be done only at high enough resolution. As a result, based on our fiducial model, we estimate that LOFAR should be able to detect a few (strong) absorptions features in a frequency range of a few tens of MHz for a 20 mJy source located at z = 10, while the SKA would extract a large fraction of the absorption information for the same source.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198456","radiative transfer;methods: numerical;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Spatial fluctuations of the CIB exhibit a clustering excess at angular scales ∼1° whose origin has not been conclusively identified, but disentangling the relative contribution from low- and high-redshift sources is not trivial. We explore the likelihood that this signal is dominated by emission from galaxies and accreting black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. We find that, the measured fluctuation signal is too large to be produced by galaxies at redshifts z > 8, which only contribute ∼0.01–0.05 nW m−2 sr−1 to the CIB. Additionally, if the first small mass galaxies have a normal initial mass function, the light of their ageing stars (fossils) integrated over cosmic time contributes a comparable amount to the CIB as their pre-reionization progenitors. In order to produce the observed level of CIB fluctuation without violating constraints from galaxy counts and the electron optical depth of the IGM, minihaloes at z > 12 must form preferably top-heavy stars with efficiency f* ≳ 0.1 and at the same time maintain a very low escape fraction of ionizing radiation, fesc < 0.1 per cent. If instead the CIB fluctuations are produced by high-z BHs, one requires vigorous accretion in the early universe reaching ρacc ≳ 105 M⊙ Mpc−3 by z ≃ 10. This growth must stop by z ∼ 6 and be significantly obscured not to overproduce the soft cosmic X-ray background and its observed coherence with the CIB. We therefore find the range of suitable high-z explanations to be narrow, but could possibly be widened by including additional physics and evolution at those epochs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198425","dark ages, reionization, first stars;diffuse radiation;early universe;galaxies: high-redshift","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Recently the first ‘flash spectrum’ of an SN IIb (SN 2013cu) has been presented, taken early enough to study its immediate circumstellar medium (CSM). Similar to a previous study by Groh, we analyse the structure and chemical composition of the optically thick CSM using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium(non-LTE) model atmospheres. For the first time, we take light-travel time effects on the spectrum formation into account, which affect the shapes and strengths of the observable emission lines, as well as the inferred SN luminosity. Based on the new CSM parameters, we estimate a lower limit of ∼0.3 M⊙ for the CSM mass, which is a factor 10–100 higher than previous estimates. The spectral fit implies a CSM in the form of a homogeneous and spherically symmetric superwind whose mass-loss rate exceeds common expectations by up to two orders of magnitude. The derived chemical composition is in agreement with a progenitor that has just left, or is just about to leave the Red-Supergiant stage, confirming the standard picture for the origin of SNe IIb. Due to its extreme mass-loss, the SN progenitor will likely appear as extreme RSG, Luminous Blue Variable, or Yellow Hypergiant. The direct detection of a superwind, and the high inferred CSM mass suggest that stellar wind mass-loss may play an important role in the formation of SNe IIb.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198441","supernovae: general;supernovae: individual: SN 2013cu;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"On methods of estimating cosmological bulk flows","A. Nusser",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","178","184","We explore similarities and differences between several estimators of the cosmological bulk flow, ${\boldsymbol B}$, from the observed radial peculiar velocities of galaxies. A distinction is made between two theoretical definitions of ${\boldsymbol B}$ as a dipole moment of the velocity field weighted by a radial window function. One definition involves the three-dimensional (3D) peculiar velocity, while the other is based on its radial component alone. Different methods attempt at inferring ${\boldsymbol B}$ for either of these definitions which coincide only for the case of a velocity field which is constant in space. We focus on the Wiener Filtering (WF) and the Constrained Minimum Variance (CMV) methodologies. Both methodologies require a prior expressed in terms of the radial velocity correlation function. Hoffman et al. compute ${\boldsymbol B}$ in Top-Hat windows from a WF realization of the 3D peculiar velocity field. Feldman et al. infer ${\boldsymbol B}$ directly from the observed velocities for the second definition of ${\boldsymbol B}$. The WF methodology could easily be adapted to the second definition, in which case it will be equivalent to the CMV with the exception of the imposed constraint. For a prior with vanishing correlations or very noisy data, CMV reproduces the standard Maximum Likelihood estimation for ${\boldsymbol B}$ of the entire sample independent of the radial weighting function. Therefore, this estimator is likely more susceptible to observational biases that could be present in measurements of distant galaxies. Finally, two additional estimators are proposed.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198419","dark matter– large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We perform a spatial and a spectral analysis; with the former, the hot halo is detected to at least 80 kpc and with the latter its properties can be measured in detail up to 42 kpc. We find evidence for a negative gradient in the temperature profile as is common for elliptical galaxies. We measure a rough metallicity profile, which is consistent with being flat at Z ∼ 0.2 Z⊙. Converting to this metallicity, the deprojected density profile is consistent with previous parametric fits, with no evidence for a break within 42 kpc (∼0.1 Rvir). Extrapolating to the virial radius, we infer a hot halo mass comparable to the stellar mass of the galaxy, and a baryon fraction from the stars and hot gas of around 30 per cent. The cooling time of the hot gas is orders of magnitude longer than the dynamical time, making the hot halo stable against cooling instabilities, and we argue that an extended stream of neutral hydrogen seen to the NW of this galaxy is instead likely due to accretion from the intergalactic medium. The low metallicity of the hot halo suggests that it too was likely accreted. We compare the hot halo of NGC 1961 to hot haloes around isolated elliptical galaxies, and show that the total mass determines the hot halo properties better than the stellar mass.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198458","galaxies: haloes;galaxies: individual: NGC 1961;galaxies: spiral;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In consequence, our ability to include them in the wider context of the formation and evolution of PNe is directly affected. Why most structures have lower densities than the PN shells hosting them? Is their intense emission in low-ionization lines the key to their main excitation mechanism? Therefore, if considered altogether, can LISs line ratios, chemical abundances and kinematics enlighten the interplay between the different excitation and formation processes? Here we present a spectroscopic analysis of five PNe that possess LISs confirming that all nebular components have comparable electron temperatures, whereas the electron density is systematically lower in LISs than in the surrounding nebula. Chemical abundances of LISs versus other PN components do not show significant differences as well. By using diagnostic diagrams from shock models, we demonstrate that LISs’ main excitation is due to shocks, whereas the other components are mainly photoionized. We also propose new diagnostic diagrams involving a few emission lines ([N II], [O III], [S II]) and log(fshocks/f*), where fshocks and f* are the ionization photon fluxes due to the shocks and the central star ionizing continuum, respectively. A robust relation differentiating the structures is found, with the shock-excited clearly having log(fshocks/f*) > −1; while the photoionized structures have log(fshocks/f*) < −2. A transition zone, with −2 < log(fshocks/f*) < −1, where both mechanisms are equally important, is also defined.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198420","radiation mechanisms: general;ISM: abundances;ISM: jets and outflows;ISM: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, it remains uncertain whether additional environmental variables, known as assembly bias, are necessary to explain other galaxy properties. We use the Illustris simulation to investigate the role of assembly bias in producing galactic conformity by considering 18 000 galaxies with Mstellar > 2 × 109 M⊙. We find a significant signal of galactic conformity: out to distances of about 10 Mpc, the mean red fraction of galaxies around redder galaxies is higher than around bluer galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Dark matter haloes exhibit an analogous conformity signal, in which the fraction of haloes formed at earlier times (old haloes) is higher around old haloes than around younger ones at fixed halo mass. A plausible interpretation of galactic conformity is the combination of the halo conformity signal with the galaxy colour–halo age relation: at fixed stellar mass, particularly towards the low-mass end, Illustris’ galaxy colours correlate with halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) preferentially found in the oldest haloes. We explain the galactic conformity effect with a simple semi-empirical model, assigning stellar mass via halo mass (abundance matching) and galaxy colour via halo age (age matching). Regarding comparison to observations, we conclude that the adopted selection/isolation criteria, projection effects, and stacking techniques can have a significant impact on the measured amplitude of the conformity signal.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198460","galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes;cosmology: theory;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We also observed N2D+ (3−2) towards 29 of the brightest peaks to analyse the level of deuteration which is an excellent probe of the quiescent of the early stages of star formation. There were 13 detections of N2D+ (3−2). This is one of the largest samples of IRDCs yet observed in these species. The deuteration ratio in these sources ranges between 0.003 and 0.14.

Surprisingly the presence or absence of an embedded 70μm source shows no correlation with the detection of N2D+ (3−2), nor does it correlate with any change in velocity dispersion or excitation temperature.

Non-linear structure formation on small scales (M200 ≲ 2 × 109 h−1 M⊙) begins slightly later in COCO-WARM than in COCO-COLD. The halo mass function at the present day in the WDM model begins to drop below its CDM counterpart at a mass ∼2 × 109 h−1 M⊙ and declines very rapidly towards lower masses so that there are five times fewer haloes of mass M200 = 108 h−1 M⊙ in COCO-WARM than in COCO-COLD.

By dividing the clouds into inner and outer disc populations, we compare their distributions of properties and test whether there are statistically significant differences between them. We find that clouds in the outer disc have lower masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions as compared to those in the inner disc for reasonable choices of the inner/outer boundary. We attribute the differences to the strong impact of galactic shear on the disc stability at large galactocentric radii. In particular, our Toomre analysis of the disc shows a narrowing envelope of unstable masses as a function of radius, resulting in the formation of smaller, lower mass fragments in the outer disc. We also show that the star formation rate is affected by the environment of the parent cloud, and is particularly influenced by the underlying surface density profile of the gas throughout the disc.

The astrometric residuals of 11 epochs have an rms dispersion of 0.4 mas, which is larger than the average precision of 0.23 mas per epoch and hints towards an additional signal or excess noise. Comparison of the point-spread functions in OSIRIS and FORS2/VLT images reveals no differences critical for high-precision astrometry, despite the GTC's segmented primary mirror.

Both fDM and δIMF are estimated within the central (one effective radius) galaxy regions, with a Jeans dynamical analysis that relies on galaxy velocity dispersions, structural parameters, and stellar mass-to-light ratios from the SMAKCED survey. In this first attempt to constrain, simultaneously, the initial mass function (IMF) normalization and the DM content, we explore the impact of different assumptions on the DM model profile. On average, for an Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) profile, the δIMF is consistent with a Chabrier-like normalization (${\delta _{\rm IMF}}\sim 1$), with ${f_{\rm DM}}\sim 0.35$. One of the main results of this work is that for at least a few systems the δIMF are heavier than the Milky Way-like value (i.e. either top- or bottom-heavy). When introducing tangential anisotropy, larger δIMF and smaller fDM are derived. Adopting a steeper concentration–mass relation than that from simulations, we find lower δIMF ( ≲ 1) and larger fDM. A constant M/L profile with null fDM gives the heaviest δIMF (∼2). In the MONDian framework, we find consistent results to those for our reference NFW model. If confirmed, the large scatter of δIMF for dEs would provide (further) evidence for a non-universal IMF in early-type systems. On average, our reference fDM estimates are consistent with those found for low-σe ($\rm \sim 100 \, \rm km s^{-1}$) early-type galaxies (ETGs). Furthermore, we find fDM consistent with values from the SMAKCED survey, and find a double-value behaviour of fDM with stellar mass, which mirrors the trend of dynamical M/L and global star formation efficiency (from abundance matching estimates) with mass.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198431","galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: general;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: stellar content","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In modified gravity versions of MOND, this EFE also appears in the Solar system and leads to a very good way to constrain the transition function of the theory. A combined analysis of the galactic rotation curves and Solar system constraints (provided by the Cassini spacecraft) rules out several classes of popular MOND transition functions, but leaves others viable. Moreover, we show that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna Pathfinder will not be able to improve the current constraints on these still viable transition functions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198470","Ephemerides;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"On the segregation of dark matter substructure","F. C. van den Bosch; F. Jiang; D. Campbell; P. Behroozi",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","158","177","We present the first comprehensive analysis of the segregation of dark matter subhaloes in their host haloes. Using three different numerical simulations, and two different segregation strength indicators, we examine the segregation of 12 different subhalo properties with respect to both orbital energy and halocentric radius (in real space as well as in projection). Subhaloes are strongly segregated by accretion redshift, which is an outcome of the inside-out assembly of their host haloes. Since subhaloes that were accreted earlier have experienced more tidal stripping, subhaloes that have lost a larger fraction of their mass at infall are on more bound orbits. Subhaloes are also strongly segregated in their masses and maximum circular velocities at accretion. We demonstrate that part of this segregation is already imprinted in the infall conditions. For massive subhaloes, it is subsequently boosted by dynamical friction, but only during their first radial orbit. The impact of these two effects is counterbalanced, though, by the fact that subhaloes with larger accretion masses are accreted later. Because of tidal stripping, subhaloes reveal little to no segregation by present-day mass or maximum circular velocity, while the corresponding torques cause subhaloes on more bound orbits to have smaller spin. There is a weak tendency for subhaloes that formed earlier to be segregated towards the centre of their host halo, which is an indirect consequence of the fact that (sub)halo formation time is correlated with other, strongly segregated properties. We discuss the implications of our results for the segregation of satellite galaxies in galaxy groups and clusters.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198477","methods: analytical;methods: statistical;galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In some cases, a turnover is seen at frequencies around 100 MHz. Kijak et al. have reported the presence of a new class of ‘Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum’ (GPS) pulsars that show spectral turnovers at frequencies around 1 GHz. We apply a model based on free–free thermal absorption to explain these turnovers in terms of surrounding material such as the dense environments found in H II regions, pulsar wind nebulae, or in cold, partially ionized molecular clouds. We show that the turnover frequency depends on the electron temperature of the environment close to the pulsar, as well as the emission measure along the line of sight. We fitted this model to the radio fluxes of known GPS pulsars and show that it can replicate the GHz turnover. From the thermal absorption model, we demonstrate that normal pulsars would exhibit a GPS-like behaviour if they were in a dense environment. We discuss the application of this model in the context of determining the population of neutron stars within the central parsec of the Galaxy. We show that a non-negligible fraction of this population might exhibit high-frequency spectral turnovers, which has implications on the detectability of these sources in the Galactic Centre.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198473","stars: neutron;pulsars: general;Galaxy: centre","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The galaxies inhabit a very broad range of environments, from cluster cores to the field. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, we quantify their structure following Hoyos et al., and divide them into disturbed and undisturbed. We also visually identify mergers. Additionally, we provide a quantitative measure of the degree of disturbance for each galaxy (‘roughness’). The majority of elliptical and lenticular galaxies have relaxed structure, showing no signs of ongoing star formation. Structurally disturbed galaxies, which tend to avoid the lowest density regions, have higher star formation activity and younger stellar populations than undisturbed systems. Cluster spirals with reduced/quenched star formation have somewhat less disturbed morphologies than spirals with ‘normal’ star formation activity, suggesting that these ‘passive’ spirals have started their morphological transformation into S0s. Visually identified mergers and galaxies not identified as mergers but with similar roughness have similar specific star formation rates and stellar ages. The degree of enhanced star formation is thus linked to the degree of structural disturbance, regardless of whether it is caused by major mergers or not. This suggests that merging galaxies are not special in terms of their higher-than-normal star formation activity. Any physical process that produces ‘roughness’, or regions of enhanced luminosity density, will increase the star formation activity in a galaxy with similar efficiency. An alternative explanation is that star formation episodes increase the galaxies’ roughness similarly, regardless of whether they are merger induced or not.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198464","galaxies: clusters: individual: Abell 901, Abell 902;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: peculiar;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such transient post-nova supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are the majority of the observed SSSs in M31. In this paper, we use the post-nova evolutionary models of Wolf et al. to compute the expected population of post-nova SSSs in M31. We predict that depending on the assumptions about the white dwarf (WD) mass distribution in novae, at any instant there are about 250–600 post-nova SSSs in M31 with (unabsorbed) 0.2–1.0 keV luminosity Lx ≥ 1036 erg s−1. Their combined unabsorbed luminosity is of the order of ∼1039 erg s−1. Their luminosity distribution shows significant steepening around log (Lx) ∼ 37.7–38 and becomes zero at Lx ≈ 2 × 1038 erg s−1, the maximum Lx achieved in the post-nova evolutionary tracks. Their effective temperature distribution has a roughly power-law shape with differential slope of ≈4–6 up to the maximum temperature of Teff ≈ 1.5 × 106 K. We compare our predictions with the results of the XMM–Newton monitoring of the central field of M31 between 2006 and 2009. The predicted number of post-nova SSSs exceeds the observed number by a factor of ≈2–5, depending on the assumed WD mass distribution in novae. This is good agreement, considering the number and magnitude of uncertainties involved in calculations of the post-nova evolutionary models and their X-ray output. Furthermore, only a moderate circumstellar absorption, with hydrogen column density of the order of ∼1021 cm−2, will remove the discrepancy.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198490","stars: luminosity function, mass function;novae, cataclysmic variables;stars: statistics;galaxies: individual: M31;X-rays: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We estimate stellar masses for each cluster and BCG using six photometric bands, the ICM mass using X-ray observations and the virial masses using the SPT Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect signature. At z = 0.9, the BCG mass $M_{\star }^{\mathrm{BCG}}$ constitutes 0.12 ± 0.01 per cent of the halo mass for a 6 × 1014 M⊙ cluster, and this fraction falls as $M_{500}^{-0.58\pm 0.07}$. The cluster stellar mass function has a characteristic mass M0 = 1011.0 ± 0.1 M⊙, and the number of galaxies per unit mass in clusters is larger than in the field by a factor of 1.65 ± 0.20. We combine our SPT sample with previously published samples at low redshift and correct to a common initial mass function and for systematic virial mass differences.

Type IIL supernovae) are explosions of progenitors with low-mass hydrogen-rich envelopes which are of the order of 1 M⊙. We investigate light-curve properties of supernovae from such progenitors. We confirm that such progenitors lead to rapidly fading Type II supernovae. We find that the luminosity of supernovae from such progenitors with the canonical explosion energy of 1051 erg and 56Ni mass of 0.05 M⊙ can increase temporarily shortly before all the hydrogen in the envelope recombines. As a result, a bump appears in their light curves. The bump appears because the heating from the nuclear decay of 56Ni can keep the bottom of hydrogen-rich layers in the ejecta ionized, and thus the photosphere can stay there for a while. We find that the light-curve bump becomes less significant when we make explosion energy larger (≳2 × 1051 erg), 56Ni mass smaller (≲0.01 M⊙), 56Ni mixed in the ejecta, or the progenitor radius larger. Helium mixing in hydrogen-rich layers makes the light-curve decline rates large but does not help reducing the light-curve bump. Because the light-curve bump we found in our light-curve models has not been observed in rapidly fading Type II supernovae, they may be characterized by not only low-mass hydrogen-rich envelopes but also higher explosion energy, larger degrees of 56Ni mixing, and/or larger progenitor radii than slowly fading Type II supernovae, so that the light-curve bump does not become significant.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198475","stars: evolution;stars: massive;stars: mass-loss;supernovae: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We observed MWC 314 with a combination of optical spectroscopy, broad-band ground- and space-based photometry, as well as with long baseline, near-infrared interferometry. We have revised the single-lined spectroscopic orbit and explored the photometric variability. The orbital light curve displays two minima each orbit that can be partially explained in terms of the tidal distortion of the primary that occurs around the time of periastron. The emission lines in the system are often double-peaked and stationary in their kinematics, indicative of a circumbinary disc. We find that the stellar wind or circumbinary disc is partially resolved in the K′-band with the longest baselines of the CHARA Array. From this analysis, we provide a simple, qualitative model in an attempt to explain the observations. From the assumption of Roche Lobe overflow and tidal synchronization at periastron, we estimate the component masses to be M1 ≈ 5 M⊙ and M2 ≈ 15 M⊙, which indicates a mass of the LBV that is extremely low. In addition to the orbital modulation, we discovered two pulsational modes with the MOST satellite. These modes are easily supported by a low-mass hydrogen-poor star, but cannot be easily supported by a star with the parameters of an LBV. The combination of these results provides evidence that the primary star was likely never a normal LBV, but rather is the product of binary interactions. As such, this system presents opportunities for studying mass-transfer and binary evolution with many observational techniques.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198443","binaries: close;stars: early-type;stars: individual: MWC 314;stars: mass-loss;stars: variables: S Doradus;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

While the average colour excess of DLAs, E(B − V), is known to be ≲ 15 millimagnitude (mmag), both detections and non-detections with ∼2 mmag precision have been reported. Here we find 3.2σ statistical evidence for DLA dust-reddening of 774 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars by comparing their fitted spectral slopes to those of ∼7000 control quasars. The corresponding E(B − V) is 3.0 ± 1.0 mmag, assuming a Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) dust extinction law, and it correlates strongly (3.5σ) with the metal content, characterized by the ${\rm Si\,{\small {II}}}$ λ1526 absorption-line equivalent width, providing additional confidence that the detection is due to dust in the DLAs. Evolution of E(B − V) over the redshift range 2.1 < z < 4.0 is limited to <2.5 mmag per unit redshift (1σ), consistent with the known, mild DLA metallicity evolution. There is also no apparent relationship with neutral hydrogen column density, $N_{\rm H\,\small {I}}$, though the data are consistent with a mean $E(B\!-\!V)/N_{\rm H\,\small {I}}=(3.5\pm 1.0)\times 10^{-24}$ mag cm2, approximately the ratio expected from the SMC scaled to the lower metallicities typical of DLAs. We implement the SDSS selection algorithm in a portable code to assess the potential for systematic, redshift-dependent biases stemming from its magnitude and colour-selection criteria. The effect on the mean E(B − V) is negligible (<5 per cent) over the entire redshift range of interest.

We show that then, the evolution of bound particle number and half-mass radius is approximately independent of eccentricity. Secondly, when we scale our results to orbits with the same semimajor axis, we find that the lifetimes are, to first order, independent of eccentricity. When the results of Baumgardt and Makino for a singular isothermal halo are scaled in the same way, the lifetime is again independent of eccentricity to first order, suggesting that this result is independent of the galactic mass profile. From both sets of simulations, we empirically derive the higher order dependence of the lifetime on eccentricity. Our results serve as benchmark for theoretical studies of the escape rate from clusters on eccentric orbits. Finally, our results can be useful for generative models for cold streams and cluster evolution models that are confined to spherical symmetry and/or time-independent tides, such as Fokker–Planck models, Monte Carlo models, and (fast) semi-analytic models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198466","methods: numerical;galaxies: star clusters: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Transients may either be discovered by the on-board detection of a new source or by the brightening of a previously known source. We show that Gaia transients can be identified as new detections on-board for offsets from the host galaxy nucleus of 0.1–0.5 arcsec, depending on magnitude and scanning angle. The Gaia detection system shows no significant loss of SNe at close radial distances to the nucleus. We used the detection efficiencies to predict the number of transients events discovered by Gaia. For a limiting magnitude of 19, we expect around 1300 SNe per year: 65 per cent SN Ia, 28 per cent SN II and 7 per cent SN Ibc, and ∼20 TDEs per year.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198454","black hole physics;supernovae: general;galaxies: jets","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In integrable potentials – where all orbits are regular – tidal debris phase-mixes close to the orbit of the progenitor system. However, the Milky Way's dark matter halo is expected not to be fully integrable; an appreciable fraction of orbits will be chaotic. This paper examines the influence of chaos on the phase-space morphology of cold tidal streams. Streams even in weakly chaotic regions look very different from those in regular regions. We find that streams can be sensitive to chaos on a much shorter time-scale than any standard prediction (from the Lyapunov or frequency-diffusion times). For example, on a weakly chaotic orbit with a chaotic time-scale predicted to be >1000 orbital periods (>1000 Gyr), the resulting stellar stream is, after just a few 10's of orbits, substantially more diffuse than any formed on a nearby but regular orbit. We find that the enhanced diffusion of the stream stars can be understood by looking at the variance in orbital frequencies of orbit ensembles centred around the parent (progenitor) orbit. Our results suggest that long, cold streams around our Galaxy must exist only on regular (or very nearly regular) orbits; they potentially provide a map of the regular regions of the Milky Way potential. This suggests a promising new direction for the use of tidal streams to constrain the distribution of dark matter around our Galaxy.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198496","chaos;Galaxy: halo;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: star clusters: general;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Historically, the angular distribution of GRBs provided important information about their origin and physical properties. As a general population, GRBs are distributed isotropically across the sky. However, there are published reports that once binned by duration or redshift, GRBs display significant clustering. We have studied the redshift- and duration-dependent clustering of GRBs using proximity measures and kernel density estimation. Utilizing bursts detected by Burst and Transient Source Experiment, Fermi/gamma-ray burst monitor, and Swift/Burst Alert Telescope, we found marginal evidence for clustering in very short duration GRBs lasting less than 100 ms.

Aragon-Calvo",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","438","448","We present a new technique that allows us to compute ensemble statistics on a local basis, directly relating halo properties to their local environment. This is achieved by the use of a correlated ensemble in which the large-scale structure (LSS) is common to all realizations while having each an independent halo population. The correlated ensemble can be stacked, effectively increasing the halo number density by an arbitrary factor, thus breaking the fundamental limit in the halo number density given by the halo mass function. This technique allows us to compute local ensemble statistics of the matter/halo distribution at any position in the simulation box, while removing the intrinsic stochasticity in the halo formation process and directly relating halo properties to their environment. We introduce the Multum In Parvo correlated ensemble simulation consisting of 220 realizations on a 32 h−1 Mpc box with 2563 particles each. This is equivalent in terms of effective volume and number of particles to a box of ∼193 h−1 Mpc of side with ∼15403 particles containing ∼5 × 106 haloes with a minimum mass of 3.25 × 109 h−1 M⊙. The potential of the technique presented here is illustrated by computing the local ensemble statistics of the halo ellipticity and halo shape–LSS alignment. We show that, while there are general trends in the ellipticity and alignment of haloes with their LSS, there are also significant spatial variations which has important implications for observational studies of galaxy shape and alignment.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198449","methods: analytical;methods: data analysis;methods: statistical;galaxies: evolution;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using Atacama Submillimetre Telescope Experiment, we mapped a 2.4 arcmin × 2.4 arcmin region towards the molecular cloud N159-W in the 13CO J = 3–2 line and observed several molecular lines at an infrared (IR) peak very close to a massive young stellar object. 12CO and 13CO J = 3–2 were observed towards two positions in N166 and one position in N132. The 13CO J = 3–2 map of the N159-W cloud shows that the molecular peak is shifted south-west compared to the peak of the IR emission. Towards the IR peak, we detected emission from HCN, HNC, HCO+, C2H J = 4–3, CS J = 7–6, and tentatively C18O J = 3–2. This is the first reported detection of these molecular lines in N159-W. The analysis of the C2H line yields more evidence supporting that the chemistry involving this molecular species in compact and/or UC H II regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud should be similar to that in Galactic ones. A non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) study of the CO emission suggests the presence of both cool and warm gas in the analysed region. The same analysis for the CS, HCO+, HCN, and HNC shows that it is very likely that their emissions arise mainly from warm gas with a density between 5 × 105 to some 106 cm−3. The obtained HCN/HNC abundance ratio greater than 1 is compatible with warm gas and with an star-forming scenario. From the analysis of the molecular lines observed towards N132 and N166, we propose that both regions should have similar physical conditions, with densities of about 103 cm−3.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198467","H II regions;ISM: molecules;galaxies: ISM;Magellanic Clouds","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the relation between two profile observables, concentration (cvir) and mass (Mvir). We have collected the largest known sample of measurements from the literature which make use of one or more of the following reconstruction techniques: weak gravitational lensing (WL), strong gravitational lensing (SL), weak+strong lensing (WL+SL), the caustic method (CM), line-of-sight velocity dispersion (LOSVD), and X-ray. We find that the concentration–mass (c–M) relation is highly variable depending upon the reconstruction technique used. We also find concentrations derived from dark matter-only simulations (at approximately Mvir ∼ 1014 M⊙) to be inconsistent with the WL and WL+SL relations at the 1σ level, even after the projection of triaxial haloes is taken into account. However, to fully determine consistency between simulations and observations, a volume-limited sample of clusters is required, as selection effects become increasingly more important in answering this. Interestingly, we also find evidence for a steeper WL+SL relation as compared to WL alone, a result which could perhaps be caused by the varying shape of cluster isodensities, though most likely reflects differences in selection effects caused by these two techniques. Lastly, we compare concentration and mass measurements of individual clusters made using more than one technique, highlighting the magnitude of the potential bias which could exist in such observational samples.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198480","gravitational lensing: strong;gravitational lensing: weak;galaxies: clusters: general;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our goal is to predict the power spectrum of the spatial fluctuations that could be observed by an intensity mapping survey. The model uses the latest data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) legacy fields and the abundance matching technique to associate UV emission and dust properties with the haloes, computing the emission from the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM), including the effects of reionization, self-consistently. The Lyα intensity from the diffuse IGM emission is 1.3 (2.0) times more intense than the ISM emission at z = 4(7); both components are fair tracers of the star-forming galaxy distribution. However the power spectrum is dominated by ISM emission on small scales (k > 0.01 h Mpc−1) with shot noise being significant only above k = 1 h Mpc−1. At very large scales (k < 0.01 h Mpc−1) diffuse IGM emission becomes important.

In particular, the measurements of the orbital inclination ip to the plane of the sky and of the sky-projected spin–orbit misalignment λ at two epochs about six years apart allowed for the determination of the longitude of the ascending node Ω and of the orbital inclination I to the apparent equatorial plane at the same epochs. As a consequence, average rates of change $\dot{\Omega }_{\rm exp}, \dot{I}_{\rm exp}$ of this two orbital elements, accurate to a ≈10−2 deg yr−1 level, were calculated as well. By comparing them to general theoretical expressions $\dot{\Omega }_{J_2}, \dot{I}_{J_2}$ for their precessions induced by an oblate star whose symmetry axis is arbitrarily oriented, we were able to determine the angle i⋆ between the line of sight the star's spin ${\boldsymbol {S}}^{\star }$ and its first even zonal harmonic $J_2^{\star }$ obtaining $i^{\star } = {142}^{+10}_{-11}\textrm {deg}, J_2^{\star } = \left(2.1^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\right)\times 10^{-4}.$ As a by-product, the angle between ${\boldsymbol {S}}^{\star }$ and the orbital angular momentum $\boldsymbol {L}$ is as large as about ψ ≈ 100 ° $\left(\psi ^{2008} = 99^{+5}_{-4}\,\textrm {deg}, \psi ^{{2014}} = 103^{+5}_{-4}\,\textrm {deg}\right)$, and changes at a rate $\dot{\psi }= 0.{7}^{+1.5}_{-1.6}\,\textrm {deg} \textrm {yr}^{-1}$.

In particular, we clarify that for certain problems AREPO only reaches first-order convergence for its original formulation. This can be rectified by simple modifications we propose to the time integration scheme and the spatial gradient estimates of the code, both improving the accuracy of the code. We demonstrate that the new implementation is indeed second-order accurate under the L1 norm, and in particular substantially improves conservation of angular momentum. Interestingly, whereas these improvements can significantly change the results of smooth test problems, we also find that cosmological simulations of galaxyformation are unaffected, demonstrating that the numerical errors eliminated by the new formulation do not impact these simulations. In contrast, simulations of binary stars followed over a large number of orbital times are strongly affected, as here it is particularly crucial to avoid a long-term build up of errors in angular momentum conservation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198495","hydrodynamics;methods: numerical;galaxy: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Parametrizing the primordial power spectrum with running α and running of running β of the spectral index, we exclude large positive α and β parameters which induce too large lensing dispersions over current observational upper bound. We ran cosmological N-body simulations of collisionless dark matter particles to investigate non-linear evolution of the primordial power spectrum with positive running parameters. The initial small-scale enhancement of the power spectrum is largely erased when entering into the non-linear regime. For example, even if the linear power spectrum at k > 10 h Mpc−1 is enhanced by 1–2 orders of magnitude, the enhancement much decreases to a factor of 2–3 at late time (z ≤ 1.5). Therefore, the lensing dispersion induced by the dark matter fluctuations weakly constrains the running parameters. When including baryon-cooling effects (which strongly enhance the small-scale clustering), the constraint is comparable to the Planck constraint, depending on the UV cut-off. Further investigations of the non-linear matter spectrum with baryonic processes is needed to reach a firm constraint.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198488","gravitational lensing: weak;cosmological parameters;cosmology: theory;inflation;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

V-types have also been found within the population of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Several questions on Vesta, the V-types, and the Howardite–Eucrite–Diogenite meteorites are still unsolved, such as the genesis of each class/subclass, their evolution and mutual relationship, and the existence of other basaltic parent bodies. We present new NIR (0.8–2.4 μm) spectroscopic observations of seven non-Vestoids, carried out at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG – INAF). We derived a number of spectral parameters (BI and BII centres, band separations, and BI slopes) and compared them with available spectra of V-types belonging to different subclasses (102 V-types in total), to highlight possible spectral differences useful to shed light on the questions mentioned above. We also considered the data from ion irradiation experiments performed on different samples of eucrites, simulating space weathering effects. Net discrepancies are seen for the BI slope distributions: NEAs show a distribution strongly different from all other V-type subclasses. Ion irradiation experiments induce strong effects on BI slope values and, as irradiation proceeds, the BI slope of eucrites quickly increases, changing the overall aspect of their VIS–NIR spectra (0.4–2.5 μm). Space weathering may explain the whole range of spectral slopes observed for all V-type subclasses. An exception is represented by NEAs, where moderate space weathering effects are evidenced. We propose that this is due to tidal perturbations exposing ‘fresh’ unweathered surface grains during close encounters with the Earth, as previously found for Q-type NEAs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198448","methods: laboratory: atomic;techniques: spectroscopic;meteorites, meteors, meteoroids;minor planets, asteroids: individual: Vesta;infrared: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We present optical and X-ray observations of GRB 130831A obtained by Swift, Chandra, Skynet, Reionization And Transients Infra-Red camera, Maidanak, International Scientific Optical-Observation Network, Nordic Optical Telescope, Liverpool Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias. This burst shows a steep drop in the X-ray light curve at ≃105 s after the trigger, with a power-law decay index of α ∼ 6. Such a rare behaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (FS) model and indicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at 105 s, must be of ‘internal origin’, produced by a dissipation process within an ultrarelativistic outflow. We propose that the source of such an outflow, which must produce the X-ray flux for ≃1 d in the cosmological rest frame, is a newly born magnetar or black hole. After the drop, the faint X-ray afterglow continues with a much shallower decay. The optical emission, on the other hand, shows no break across the X-ray steep decrease, and the late-time decays of both the X-ray and optical are consistent. Using both the X-ray and optical data, we show that the emission after ≃105 s can be explained well by the FS model. We model our data to derive the kinetic energy of the ejecta and thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a GRB with emission of internal origin visible for a long time. Furthermore, we break down the energy budget of this GRB into the prompt emission, the late internal dissipation, the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it with the energy of the associated supernova, SN 2013 fu.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198438","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;shock waves;gamma-ray burst: general;gamma-ray burst: individual: GRB 130831A;stars: magnetars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Strong constraints on a super-Eddington accretion flow: XMM–Newton observations of an intermediate-mass black hole","C. Jin; C. Done; M.

We show results from two new XMM–Newtonobservations, exhibiting soft 2–10 keV spectra, a strong excess at lower energies, and fast X-ray variability which is typical of this class of AGN. The soft excess can be equally well fit using either low-temperature Comptonization or highly smeared, ionized reflection models, but we additionally consider the fast X-ray variability to produce covariance, lag and coherence spectra to show that the low-temperature Comptonization model gives a better description of the break in variability properties between soft and hard X-rays. Both these models require an additional component at the softest energies, as expected from the accretion disc. However, standard disc models cannot connect this to the optical/UV emission from the outer disc unless the mass is underestimated by an order of magnitude. The variable optical and far UV emission instead suggests that L/LEdd ∼ 10 through the outer disc, in which case advection and/or wind losses are required to explain the observed broad-band spectral energy distribution. This implies that the accretion geometry close to the black hole is unlikely to be a flat disc as assumed in the recent X-ray reverberation mapping techniques.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198462","accretion, accretion discs;galaxies: nuclei;galaxies: Seyfert;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The main finding of our work is that the reaction H2O + OD → OH + HDO occurs and that this may affect the HDO/H2O abundances in space. The opposite reaction D2O + OH → OD + HDO is much less effective, and also given the lower D2O abundances in space not expected to be of astronomical relevance.

These objects were selected because they showed signs of an interstellar medium and/or star formation. A large amount of gas (>2 × 108 M⊙) is present in 10 out of 15 objects, and these galaxies have gas fractions higher than expected based on extrapolation from lower mass samples. We tentatively interpret this as evidence that stellar mass-loss and hot halo cooling may be starting to play a role in fuelling the most massive galaxies. These MASSIVE ETGs seem to have lower star formation efficiencies (SFE = SFR/MH2) than spiral galaxies, but the SFEs derived are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution found in other lower mass ETG samples. This suggests that the SFE is not simply a function of stellar mass, but that local, internal processes are more important for regulating star formation. Finally, we used the CO line profiles to investigate the high-mass end of the Tully–Fisher relation (TFR). We find that there is a break in the slope of the TFR for ETGs at high masses (consistent with previous studies). The strength of this break correlates with the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, suggesting it is caused by additional baryonic mass being present in the centre of massive ETGs. We speculate on the root cause of this change and its implications for galaxy formation theories.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198457","ISM: molecules;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Based on the physical properties, various types of clouds are considered. We find that in diffuse cloud regions, very strong radiation fields persists and hardly a few layers of surface species are formed. In translucent cloud regions with a moderate radiation field, significant number of layers would be produced and surface coverage is mainly dominated by photo-dissociation products such as, C, CH3, CH2D, OH and OD. In the intermediate dense cloud regions (having number density of total hydrogen nuclei in all forms ∼2 × 104 cm−3), water and methanol along with their deuterated derivatives are efficiently formed. For much higher density regions (∼106 cm−3), water and methanol productions are suppressed but surface coverages of CO, CO2, O2 and O3 are dramatically increased. We find a very high degree of fractionation of water and methanol. Observational results support a high fractionation of methanol but surprisingly water fractionation is found to be low. This is in contradiction with our model results indicating alternative routes for de-fractionation of water. Effects of various types of energy barriers are also studied. Moreover, we allow grain mantles to interact with various charged particles (such as H+, Fe+, S+ and C+) to study the stopping power and projected range of these charged particles on various target ices.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198433","astrochemistry;ISM: abundances;dust, extinction;ISM: molecules","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using SDSS groups of Yang et al., we study how fc correlates with galaxy properties such as colour, star formation rate, metallicity, bulge-to-disc ratio, and size. Central galaxies of a given stellar mass in groups with fc > 0.02 tend to be redder in colour, more quenched in star formation, smaller in size, and more bulge dominated, as fc increases. The trends in colour and star formation appear to reverse at fc < 0.02, reflecting a downsizing effect that galaxies in massive haloes formed their stars earlier although the host haloes themselves assembled later (lower fc). No such reversal is seen in the size of elliptical galaxies, suggesting that their assembly follows halo growth more closely than their star formation. Satellite galaxies of a given stellar mass in groups of a given halo mass tend to be redder in colour, more quenched in star formation and smaller in size as fc increases. For a given stellar mass, satellites also tend to be smaller than centrals. The trends are stronger for lower mass groups. For groups more massive than ∼1013 M⊙, a weak reversed trend is seen in colour and star formation. The observed trends in star formation are qualitatively reproduced by an empirical model based on halo age abundance matching, but not by a semi-analytical model tested here.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198440","methods: statistical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Earlier numerical work reported only a very weak dependence at best, results that call into question the canonical α-disc model and the thermal stability results that follow from it. Our simulations, in contrast, exhibit a stronger relationship, and show that previous work was box-size limited: turbulent ‘eddies’ were artificially restricted by the numerical domain rather than by the scaleheight. Zero-net-flux runs without physical diffusion coefficients yield a stress proportional to P0.5, where P is pressure. The stresses are also proportional to the grid length and hence remain numerically unconverged. The same runs with physical diffusivities, however, give a result closer to an α-disc: the stress is ∝P0.9. Net-flux simulations without explicit diffusion exhibit stresses ∝P0.5, but stronger imposed fields weaken this correlation. In summary, compressibility is important for the saturation of the MRI, but the exact stress–pressure relationship is difficult to ascertain in local simulations because of numerical convergence issues and the influence of any imposed flux. As a consequence, the interpretation of thermal stability behaviour in local simulations is a problematic enterprise.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198442","accretion, accretion discs;MHD;turbulence","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We identify that the time derivative of the rotational frequency (ν) varies quasi-periodically with a period of ∼350 d, switching mainly between two spin-down states. The profile shape of the pulsar is correlated with the ν̇ variation, producing two slightly different profile shapes corresponding to high- and low-ν̇ states. In addition to these two normal emission states, we confirm the occasional flare-state of the pulsar, in which the emission appears early in spin phase compared to that of the common normal emission. The profile of the flare-state is significantly different from that of the two normal emission states. The correlation analysis further shows that the flare-state is not directly linked with the ν̇ changes. With a simple emission beam model, we estimate the emission altitude of the normal emission to be 240 km, and explain the origin of the flare-state as an emission height variation from the leading edge of the beam. We also argue that the emission of these states can be explained with a partially active beam model. In this scenario, the trailing portion of the radio beam is usually active and the normal emission is produced. The flare-state occurs when the leading edge of the beam becomes active while the trailing part is being blocked. This model estimates a fixed emission altitude of 360 km. However, the cause of the flare-state (i.e. the emission height variation, or the time-dependent activity across the radio beam) is not easily explained.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198500","stars: neutron;pulsars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The largest uncertainty arises due to the poorly constrained occupation fraction of SMBHs in low-mass galaxies, which otherwise dominate the total TDE rate. The detection rate of TDE flares by optical surveys is calculated as a function of SMBH mass and other observables for several physically motivated models of TDE emission. We also quantify the fraction of galaxies that produce deeply penetrating disruption events. If the majority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington luminosities (such as disc winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis relativistic jet), then the measured SMBH mass distribution will tightly constrain the low-end SMBH occupation fraction. If Eddington-limited emission channels dominate, however, then the occupation fraction sensitivity is much less pronounced in a flux-limited survey (although still present in a volume-complete event sample). The SMBH mass distribution of the current sample of TDEs, though highly inhomogeneous and encumbered by selection effects, already suggests that Eddington-limited emission channels dominate. Even our most conservative rate estimates appear to be in tension with much lower observationally inferred TDE rates, and we discuss several possible resolutions to this discrepancy.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198439","accretion, accretion discs;black hole physics;galaxies: nuclei;X-rays: bursts","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use toy models for the distribution of recoil velocities, BH trajectories, and the geometry of obscuring dust tori in galactic centres, to simulate 2.5 × 105 random observations of recoiling quasars. BHs with recoil velocities comparable to the escape velocity from the galactic centre remain bound to the nucleus, and do not fully settle back to the centre of the torus due to dynamical friction in a typical quasar lifetime. We find that |Δv| and Σdust for these BHs are positively correlated. For obscured (Σdust > 0) and for partially obscured (0 < Σdust ≲ 2.3 g m−2) quasars with |Δv| ≥ 45 km s−1, the sample correlation coefficient between log10(|Δv|) and Σdust is r45 = 0.28 ± 0.02 and r45 = 0.13 ± 0.02, respectively. Allowing for random ± 100 km s− 1 errors in |Δv| unrelated to the recoil dilutes the correlation for the partially obscured quasars to r45 = 0.026 ± 0.004 measured between |Δv| and Σdust. A random sample of ≳ 3500 obscured quasars with |Δv| ≥ 45 km s−1 would allow rejection of the no-correlation hypothesis with 3σ significance 95 per cent of the time. Finally, we find that the fraction of obscured quasars, $\cal {F_{\rm obs}}$ (|Δv|), decreases with |Δv| from $\cal {F_{\rm obs}}$ (<10 km s−1) ≳ 0.8 to $\cal {F_{\rm obs}}$ (>103 km s−1) ≲ 0.4.

Previous studies on these objects are limited by both resolution and wavelength regions and the results differ significantly from each other. We have undertaken to reanalyse the chemical composition of these objects based on high-resolution Subaru spectra covering the wavelength regions 4020–6775 Å. Considering local thermodynamic equilibrium and using model atmospheres, we have derived the stellar parameters, the effective temperatures Teff, surface gravities log g, and metallicities [Fe/H] for these objects. The derived parameters for HD 26, HD 100764, HD 198269 and HD 224959 are (5000, 1.6, −1.13), (4750, 2.0 −0.86), (4500, 1.5, −2.06) and (5050, 2.1, −2.44), respectively. The stars are found to exhibit large enhancements of heavy elements relative to iron in conformity to previous studies. Large enhancement of Pb with respect to iron is also confirmed. Updates on the elemental abundances for several s-process elements (Y, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm and Pb) along with the first-time estimates of abundances for a number of other heavy elements (Sr, Ba, Pr, Eu, Er and W) are reported. Our analysis suggests that neutron-capture elements in HD 26 primarily originate in the s-process while the major contributions to the abundances of neutron-capture elements in the more metal-poor objects HD 224959 and HD 198269 are from the r-process, possibly from materials that are pre-enriched with products of the r-process.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198417","stars: abundances;stars: carbon;stars: individual: HD 26;stars: individual: HD 198269;stars: individual: HD 224959;stars: individual: HD 100764","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Transient C IV broad absorption lines in radio-detected QSOs","M. Vivek; R. Srianand; N. Gupta",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","136","149","We study the transient (i.e. emerging or disappearing) C IV broad absorption line (BAL) components in 50 radio-detected QSOs using multi-epoch spectra available in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release-10. We report the detection of six BALQSOs having at least one distinct transient C IV absorption component. Based on the structure function analysis of optical light curves, we suggest that the transient absorption is unlikely to be triggered by continuum variations. Transient absorption components usually have low C IV equivalent widths (<8 Å), high ejection velocities (>10 000 km s−1) and typically occur over rest-frame time-scales >800 d. The detection rate of transient C IV absorption seen in our sample is higher than that reported in the literature. Using a control sample of QSOs, we show that this difference is most likely due to the longer monitoring time-scale of sources in our sample while the effect of small number statistics cannot be ignored. Thus, in order to establish the role played by radio jets in driving the BAL outflows, we need a larger sample of radio-detected BALs monitored over more than 3 yr in the QSO's rest frame. We also find that the transient phenomenon in radio-detected and radio-quiet BALs does not depend on any of the QSO properties, i.e. the Eddington ratio, black hole mass, bolometric luminosity and optical-to-IR colours. All this suggests that transient BAL phenomenon is simply the extreme case of BAL variability.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198429","galaxies: active;quasars: absorption lines;quasars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Bright vigorous winds as signposts of supermassive black hole birth","D. Fiacconi; E. M. Rossi",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","455","1","2","16","The formation of supermassive black holes is still an outstanding question. In the quasi-star scenario, black hole seeds experience an initial super-Eddington growth, that in less than a million years may leave a 104–105 M⊙ black hole at the centre of a protogalaxy at z ∼ 20–10. Super-Eddington accretion, however, may be accompanied by vigorous mass-loss that can limit the amount of mass that reaches the black hole. In this paper, we critically assess the impact of radiative driven winds, launched from the surface of the massive envelopes from which the black hole accretes. Solving the full wind equations coupled with the hydrostatic structure of the envelope, we find mass outflows with rates between a few tens and 104 M⊙ yr−1, mainly powered by advection luminosity within the outflow. We therefore confirm the claim by Dotan et al. that mass losses can severely affect the black hole seed early growth within a quasi-star. In particular, seeds with mass >104 M⊙ can only form within mass reservoirs ≳107 M⊙, unless they are refilled at huge rates (≳100 M⊙ yr−1). This may imply that only very massive haloes (>109 M⊙) at those redshifts can harbour massive seeds. Contrary to previous claims, these winds are expected to be relatively bright (1044–1047 erg s−1), blue (Teff ∼ 8000 K) objects, that while eluding the Hubble Space Telescope, could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198428","hydrodynamics;radiation: dynamics;methods: analytical;stars: massive;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The scenario accounts for a resonant interaction of normal r-modes with superfluid inertial modes at some specific internal stellar temperatures (‘resonance temperatures’). This interaction results in an enhanced damping of r-mode and appearance of the ‘stability peaks’ in the temperature – spin frequency plane, which split the r-mode instability window in the vicinity of the resonance temperatures. The scenario suggests that the hot and rapidly rotating NSs spend most of their life climbing up these peaks and, in particular, are observed there at the moment. We analyse in detail possible observational signatures of this suggestion. In particular, we show that these objects may exhibit ‘anti-glitches’ – sudden frequency jumps on a time-scale of hours–months.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198485","stars: interiors;stars: neutron;pulsars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The Galactic objects are used to generate a calibration between Ca II triplet line strength and [Fe/H], which is then used to estimate [Fe/H]CaT for the LMC stars. The values are then compared with the [Fe/H]spec determinations from high-dispersion spectroscopy. After allowance for a small systematic offset, the two abundance determinations are in excellent agreement. Further, as found in earlier studies, the difference is only a very weak function of the [Ca/Fe] ratio. For example, changing [Ca/Fe] from +0.3 to −0.2 causes the Ca II-based abundance to underestimate [Fe/H]spec by only ∼0.15 dex, assuming a Galactic calibration. Consequently, the Ca II triplet approach to metallicity determinations can be used without significant bias to study stellar systems that have substantially different chemical evolution histories.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198459","techniques: spectroscopic;stars: abundances;stars: Population II;globular clusters: general;Magellanic Clouds","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The red branch stars remain on statistical cleaned colour–magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which are distinguished from main sequence (MS) through new proposed colour–magnitude ratio diagram (CMRD) approach. The fraction of red stars is high for NGC 6866 than that of NGC 2099. This approach gives 1599 and 1357 MS stars in NGC 2099 and NGC 6866, respectively. To them, membership probability is assigned through the spatiokinematic probability. For which, the mean proper motion of each cluster is calculated through Gaussian-fit technique on the data of proper motion values of MS stars. The values of membership probability are used to classify them into unlikely, likely, probable and most probable members (MPMs). The basic parameters (distance, age, etc.) and various colour-ratios are estimated by utilizing the UBVRIJHKW1W2 photometric magnitudes of MPMs and tested the extinction law through two-colour diagrams (TCDs). The photometric broadening on CMDs produced by stars having abnormal colours. Such stars are not considered for the dynamical study due to scattering. The nature of member evaporation from the core is understandable through the study of half-mass radius and dissociation time. The stellar evaporation rate in NGC 6866 is five times that of NGC 2099.

A popular such model is f(R) gravity, in which the Ricci scalar in the Einstein–Hilbert action is replaced by a general function of it. We study the f(R) model of Hu & Sawicki, which recovers standard general relativity in high-density regimes, while reproducing the desired late time acceleration at cosmological scales. We run a suite of high-resolution zoom simulations using the ecosmog code to examine the effect of f(R) gravity on the properties of a halo that is analogous to the Virgo cluster. We show that the velocity dispersion profiles can potentially discriminate between f(R) models and ΛCDM, and provide complementary analysis of lensing signal profiles to explore the possibility to further distinguish the different f(R) models. Our results confirm the techniques explored by Cabré et al. to quantify the effect of environment in the behaviour of f(R) gravity, and we extend them to study halo satellites at various redshifts. We find that the modified gravity effects in our models are most observable at low redshifts, and that effects are generally stronger for satellites far from the centre of the main halo. We show that the screening properties of halo satellites trace very well that of dark matter particles, which means that low-resolution simulations in which subhaloes are not very well resolved can in principle be used to study satellite properties. We discuss observables, particularly for halo satellites, that can potentially be used to constrain the observational viability of f(R) gravity.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208265","methods: numerical;galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;cosmology: theory;dark energy","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"On the frequency dependence of pulsar linear polarization","P. F. Wang; C. Wang; J. L. Han",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","448","1","771","780","The frequency dependence of pulsar linear polarization is investigated using simulations of emission and propagation processes. Linearly polarized waves are generated through curvature radiation by relativistic particles streaming along curved magnetic field lines, which have ordinary-mode (O-mode) and extraordinary-mode (X-mode) components. As the emitted waves propagate outwards, the two mode components are separated, due to refraction of the O mode, and their polarization states are also modified. According to the radius-to-frequency mapping, low-frequency emission is generated from the higher magnetosphere, where significant rotation effects lead the X and O modes to become separated. Hence, the low-frequency radiation has a large fraction of linear polarization. As the frequency increases, emission is generated from lower heights, where the rotation effect becomes weaker and the distribution regions of the two modes are more overlapped. Hence, more significant depolarization appears for emission at higher frequencies. In addition, the refraction effect of the O mode becomes significant in the very deep magnetosphere, which bends the O-mode emission towards the outer parts of a pulsar beam and also causes the separation of the mode distribution regions; hence the fractional linear polarization increases with frequency. If emission of different frequencies is generated from a region of the same height, significant O-mode refraction can result in the decrease of both profile width and fractional linear polarization. The observed frequency dependence of linear polarization for some pulsars can be explained naturally within the scope of our scenario.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208270","polarization;radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;radiative transfer;pulsars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

All PSBs harbour significant molecular gas and dust reservoirs and residual star formation, indicating that complete quenching of the starburst due to exhaustion or expulsion of gas has not occurred during this timespan. As the starburst ages, we observe a clear decrease in the star formation efficiency, molecular gas and star formation rate (SFR) surface density, and effective dust temperature, from levels coincident with starburst galaxies to those of normal star-forming galaxies. These trends are consistent with a natural decrease in the SFR following consumption of molecular gas by the starburst, and corresponding decrease in the interstellar radiation field strength as the starburst ages. The gas and dust contents of the PSBs are coincident with those of star-forming galaxies and molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies, and are not consistent with galaxies on the red sequence. We find no evidence that the global gas reservoir is expelled by stellar winds or active galactic nuclei feedback. Our results show that although a strong starburst in a low-redshift galaxy may cause the galaxy to ultimately have a lower specific SFR and be of an earlier morphological type, the galaxy will remain in the ‘green valley’ for an extended time. Multiple such episodes may be needed to complete migration of the galaxy from the blue- to red sequence.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208249","dust, extinction;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: starburst;submillimetre: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Koo",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","448","1","237","251","We investigate the roles of two classes of quenching mechanisms for central and satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (z < 0.075): those involving the halo and those involving the formation of a compact centre. For central galaxies with inner compactness Σ1 kpc ∼ 109–9.4 M⊙ kpc−2, the quenched fraction fq is strongly correlated with Σ1 kpc with only weak halo mass Mh dependence. However, at higher and lower Σ1 kpc, specific star formation rate (sSFR) is a strong function of Mh and mostly independent of Σ1 kpc. In other words, Σ1 kpc ∼ 109–9.4 M⊙ kpc−2 divides galaxies into those with high sSFR below and low sSFR above this range. In both the upper and lower regimes, increasing Mh shifts the entire sSFR distribution to lower sSFR without a qualitative change in shape. This is true even at fixed M*, but varying M* at fixed Mh adds no quenching information. Most of the quenched centrals with Mh > 1011.8 M⊙ are dense (Σ1 kpc > 109 M⊙ kpc−2), suggesting compaction-related quenching maintained by halo-related quenching. However, 21 per cent are diffuse, indicating only halo quenching. For satellite galaxies in the outskirts of haloes, quenching is a strong function of compactness and a weak function of host Mh. In the inner halo, Mh dominates quenching, with ∼90 per cent of the satellites being quenched once Mh > 1013 M⊙. This regional effect is greatest for the least massive satellites. As demonstrated via semi-analytic modelling with simple prescriptions for quenching, the observed correlations can be explained if quenching due to central compactness is rapid while quenching due to halo mass is slow.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208263","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: general;galaxies: groups: general;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: star formation;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The Double Pulsar has been assumed to dominate the Galactic NS–NS binary merger rate ${\cal R}_{\rm g}$ among all known systems, solely based on the properties of the first-born, recycled pulsar (PSR J0737−3039A, or A) with an assumption for the beaming correction factor of 6. In this work, we carefully correct observational biases for the second-born, non-recycled pulsar (PSR J0737−0737B, or B) and estimate the contribution from the Double Pulsar on ${\cal R}_{\rm g}$ using constraints available from both A and B. Observational constraints from the B pulsar favour a small beaming correction factor for A (∼2), which is consistent with a bipolar model. Considering known NS–NS binaries with the best observational constraints, including both A and B, we obtain ${\cal R}_{\rm g}=21_{-14}^{+28}$ Myr−1 at 95 per cent confidence from our reference model.

The evolution of the BH–accretion tori is simulated for seconds with a Newtonian hydrodynamics code including viscosity effects, pseudo-Newtonian gravity for rotating BHs, and an energy-dependent two-moment closure scheme for the transport of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. The investigated cases are guided by relativistic double neutron star (NS–NS) and NS–BH merger models, producing ∼3–6 M⊙ BHs with rotation parameters of ABH ∼ 0.8 and tori of 0.03–0.3 M⊙. Our nucleosynthesis analysis includes the dynamical (prompt) ejecta expelled during the CBM phase and the neutrino and viscously driven outflows of the relic BH–torus systems. While typically ∼20–25 per cent of the initial accretion-torus mass are lost by viscously driven outflows, neutrino-powered winds contribute at most another ∼1 per cent, but neutrino heating enhances the viscous ejecta significantly. Since BH–torus ejecta possess a wide distribution of electron fractions (0.1–0.6) and entropies, they produce heavy elements from A ∼ 80 up to the actinides, with relative contributions of A ≳ 130 nuclei being subdominant and sensitively dependent on BH and torus masses and the exact treatment of shear viscosity. The combined ejecta of CBM and BH–torus phases can reproduce the solar abundances amazingly well for A ≳ 90. Varying contributions of the torus ejecta might account for observed variations of lighter elements with 40 ≤ Z ≤ 56 relative to heavier ones, and a considerable reduction of the prompt ejecta compared to the torus ejecta, e.g. in highly asymmetric NS–BH mergers, might explain the composition of heavy-element deficient stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208275","accretion, accretion discs;hydrodynamics;neutrinos;nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances;stars: neutron","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

About 1 in 10 Centaurs in Chiron-like orbits enter Earth-crossing epochs, usually repeatedly, each such epoch being generally of a few thousand years' duration. On time-scales of geological interest, debris from their breakup may increase the mass of the near-Earth interplanetary environment by two or three orders of magnitude, yielding repeated episodes of bombardment and stratospheric dusting.

Nuclear star clusters (NCs) located at the centre of galaxies are known to harbour massive black holes (MBHs) and to be bounded by a gravitational potential by other galactic components such as the galactic bulge. Such an environment of NCs provides a favourable conditions for the BH–BH binary formation by the gravitational radiation capture due to the high BH number density and velocity dispersion. We carried out detailed numerical study of the formation of BH binaries in the NCs using a series of N-body simulations for equal-mass cases. There is no mass segregation introduced. We have derived scaling relations of the binary formation rate with the velocity dispersion of the stellar system beyond the radius of influence and made estimates of the rate of formation of BH binaries per unit comoving volume and thus expected detection rate by integrating the binary formation rate over galaxy population within the detection distance of the advanced detectors. We find that the overall formation rates for BH–BH binaries per NC is ∼10−10 yr−1 for the Milky Way-like galaxies and weakly dependent on the mass of MBH as Γ ∝  $M_{\rm MBH}^{3/28}$. We estimate the detection rate of 0.02–14 yr−1 for advanced LIGO/Virgo considering several factors such as the dynamical evolution of NCs, the variance of the number density of stars and the mass range of MBH giving uncertainties.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208288","gravitational waves;methods: numerical;galaxies: nuclei","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Their identification is generally based on density or geometry criteria that, because of their very nature, are prone to shot noise. We propose two void finders that are based on dynamical criterion to select voids in Lagrangian coordinates and minimize the impact of sparse sampling. The first approach exploits the Zel'dovich approximation to trace back in time the orbits of galaxies located in voids and their surroundings; the second uses the observed galaxy–galaxy correlation function to relax the objects’ spatial distribution to homogeneity and isotropy. In both cases voids are defined as regions of the negative velocity divergence, which can be regarded as sinks of the back-in-time streamlines of the mass tracers. To assess the performance of our methods we used a dark matter halo mock catalogue codecs, and compared the results with those obtained with the zobov void finder. We find that the void divergence profiles are less scattered than the density ones and, therefore, their stacking constitutes a more accurate cosmological probe. The significance of the divergence signal in the central part of voids obtained from both our finders is 60 per cent higher than for overdensity profiles in the zobov case.

Using pixel statistics we find that SNe Ia show the lowest degree of association with Hα emission of all supernova (SN) types. It is also found that they do not trace near-UV emission. As the latter traces SF on time-scales less than 100 Myr, this rules out any extreme ‘prompt’ delay times as the dominant progenitor channel of SNe Ia. SNe Ia best trace the B-band light distribution of their host galaxies. This implies that the population within star-forming galaxies is dominated by relatively young progenitors. Splitting SNe by their (B − V) colours at maximum light, ‘redder’ events show a higher degree of association with H ii regions and are found more centrally within hosts. We discuss possible explanations of this result in terms of line-of-sight extinction and progenitor effects.

PKS 2254−367 and the radio source in NGC 1052 (PKS 0238−084; D = 17.2 Mpc) are the two closest GPS radio sources to us, far closer than the next closest example, PKS 1718−649 (D = 59 Mpc). As such, IC 1459 and NGC 1052 offer opportunities to study the details of the parsec-scale radio sources as well as the environments that the radio sources inhabit, across the electromagnetic spectrum. Given that some models for the origin and evolution of GPS radio sources require a strong connection between the radio source morphology and the gaseous nuclear environment, such opportunities for detailed study are important. Our VLBI images of PKS 2254−367 show that the previously identified similarities between IC 1459 and NGC 1052 continue on to the parsec-scale. Both compact radio sources appear to have symmetric jets of approximately the same luminosity, much lower than typically noted in compact double GPS sources. Similarities between PKS 2254−367 and NGC 1052, and differences with respect to other GPS galaxies, lead us to speculate that a sub-class of GPS radio sources, with low luminosity and with jet-dominated morphologies, exists and would be largely absent from radio source surveys with ∼1 Jy flux density cut-offs. We suggest that this possible low-luminosity, jet-dominated population of GPS sources could be an analogue of the Fanaroff–Riley type I (FR I) radio galaxies, with the higher luminosity lobe-dominated GPS sources being the analogue of the FR II radio galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208264","techniques: high angular resolution;galaxies: active;galaxies: individual: PKS 2254−367 (IC 1459)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To recover the observed Thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) requires SFRs at the level of ∼ 10− 3 M⊙ yr− 1 Mpc− 3 at z ∼ 15 from Pop III stars, or ∼ 10− 1 M⊙ yr− 1 Mpc− 3 at z ∼ 7 from Pop II stars. In the case the SFR is dominated by Pop III stars, the IGM quickly heats above the CMB at z ≳ 12 due to heating from supernovae. In addition, Lyα photons from haloes hosting Pop III stars couple the spin temperature to that of the gas, resulting in a deep absorption signal. If the SFR is dominated by Pop II stars, the IGM slowly heats and exceeds the CMB temperature at z ∼ 10. However, the larger and varying fraction of Pop III stars are able to break this degeneracy. We find that the impact of the initial mass function (IMF) of Pop III stars on the 21-cm signal results in an earlier change to a positive signal if the IMF slope is ∼−1.2. Measuring the 21-cm signal at z ≳ 10 with next generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array will be able to investigate the contribution from Pop III and Pop II stars to the global SFR.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208243","stars: Population II;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;dark ages, reionization, first stars;diffuse radiation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Recent measurements of the emissivity profiles of accretion discs as well as reverberation time lags between the primary X-ray continuum and the reflection suggest that this corona is situated at a low height above the disc and extends radially, tens of gravitational radii over the disc surface, hence should also Compton scatter the reflected X-rays. We find that the detection of blurred reflection from as close in as the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of maximally rotating black holes is consistent with such coronae, but requires that the corona be patchy, consisting perhaps of a number of isolated flares throughout the region. Considering only the requirement that it be possible to detect reflection from the ISCO, we find that at any given moment, the covering fraction of the inner part of the accretion disc by the corona needs to be less than 85 per cent, although the detection of ‘reflection-dominated’ spectra in which the total reflected flux exceeds that seen in the continuum requires covering fractions as low as 50 or 25 per cent.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208235","accretion, accretion discs;black hole physics;radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;galaxies: active;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

While the detection of common proper motion led to the interpretation as Jovian-mass companion, later non-detections in the infrared raised doubts. Recent astrometric measurements indicate a belt crossing or highly eccentric orbit for the object, if a companion, making the planetary interpretation potentially even more problematic. In this study we discuss the possibility of Fomalhaut b being a background object with a high proper motion. By analysing the available photometric and astrometric data of the object, we show that they are fully consistent with a neutron star: neutron stars are faint, hot (blue), and fast moving. Neutron stars with an effective temperature of the whole surface area being 112 000–126 500 K (with small to negligible extinction) at a distance of roughly 11 pc (best fit) would be consistent with all observables, namely with the photometric detections in the optical, with the upper limits in the infrared and X-rays, as well as with the astrometry (consistent with a distances of 11 pc or more and high proper motion as typical for neutron stars) and non-detection of pulsation (not beamed). We consider the probability of finding an unrelated object or even a neutron star nearby and mostly co-aligned in proper motion with Fomalhaut A and come to the conclusion that this is definitely well possible.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208261","stars: individual: Fomalhaut;stars: neutron;planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We demonstrate that the molecular cloud does not cover the background source completely. The partial coverage reveals itself as a residual flux at the bottom of the saturated H2 absorption lines. This amounts to about (2.22 ± 0.54) per cent of the continuum and does not depend on the wavelength. This value is small and it explains why this effect has not been detected in previous studies of this quasar spectrum. However, it is robustly detected and is significantly higher than the zero-flux level at the bottom of the saturated lines of the Lyα forest, (−0.21 ± 0.22) per cent. The presence of the residual flux could be caused by unresolved quasar multicomponents, by light scattered by dust and/or by jet–cloud interaction. The H2 absorption system is very well described by a two-component model without the inclusion of additional components when we take partial coverage into account. The derived total column densities in the H2 absorption components A and B are log N(H2)(cm−2) = 18.10 ± 0.02 and 17.82 ± 0.02, respectively. HD molecules are present only in component B. Given the column density, log N(HD) = 13.33 ± 0.02, we find N(HD)/2N(H2) = (1.48 ± 0.10) × 10− 5, significantly lower than previous estimations. We argue that it is crucial to take into account the partial coverage effects in any analysis of H2 bearing absorption systems, in particular when studying the physical state of the high-redshift interstellar medium.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208239","ISM: clouds;quasars: individual: Q 0528−250;cosmology: observations","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We propose a model where the optical radiation is modulated by the oscillating X-ray flux resulting in varying irradiation of the outer parts of the accretion disc. The proposed QPO mechanism inevitably takes place in the systems with sufficiently small ratio of the outer disc radius to the QPO period. We show that, unlike in the case of the aperiodic variability, it is not possible to obtain the optical QPO profiles from those observed in the X-rays through the transfer function, because of different X-ray signals seen by the disc and by the observer. We demonstrate that with the increasing QPO frequency, occurring at the rising phase of the X-ray outburst, the rms should be constant for sufficiently low frequencies, then to increase reaching the peak and finally to drop substantially when the QPO period becomes comparable to the light-crossing time to the outer disc. We predict that the QPO rms in this model should increase towards shorter wavelengths and this fact can be used to distinguish it from other QPO mechanisms.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208259","accretion, accretion discs;black hole physics;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

If other stars possess extrasolar analogues to the Solar Oort cloud, the orbits of comets in such clouds will be scrambled by white dwarf natal kicks. Although most comets will be unbound, some will be placed on low angular momentum orbits vulnerable to sublimation or tidal disruption. The dusty debris from these comets will manifest itself as an IR excess temporarily visible around newborn white dwarfs; examples of such discs may already have been seen in the Helix Nebula, and around several other young white dwarfs. Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope may distinguish this hypothesis from alternatives such as a dynamically excited Kuiper Belt analogue. Although competing hypotheses exist, the observation that ≳15 per cent of young white dwarfs possess such discs, if interpreted as indeed being cometary in origin, provides indirect evidence that low-mass gas giants (thought necessary to produce an Oort cloud) are common in the outer regions of extrasolar planetary systems. Hydrogen abundances in the atmospheres of older white dwarfs can, if sufficiently low, also be used to place constraints on the joint parameter space of natal kicks and exo-Oort cloud models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208251","accretion, accretion discs;comets: general;white dwarfs;infrared: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

If not corrected, it leads to a systematic bias in the estimation of cluster masses from X-ray and Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) observations assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, and affects interpretation of measurements of the SZ power spectrum and observations of cluster outskirts from ongoing and upcoming large cluster surveys. Recently, Shi & Komatsu developed an analytical model for predicting the radius, mass, and redshift dependence of the non-thermal pressure contributed by the kinetic random motions of intracluster gas sourced by the cluster mass growth. In this paper, we compare the predictions of this analytical model to a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation. As different mass growth histories result in different non-thermal pressure, we perform the comparison on 65 simulated galaxy clusters on a cluster-by-cluster basis. We find an excellent agreement between the modelled and simulated non-thermal pressure profiles. Our results open up the possibility of using the analytical model to correct the systematic bias in the mass estimation of galaxy clusters. We also discuss tests of the physical picture underlying the evolution of intracluster non-thermal gas motions, as well as a way to further improve the analytical modelling, which may help achieve a unified understanding of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208289","methods: analytical;methods: numerical;galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium;cosmology: observations","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that star formation (SF) in the WDM model is reduced and delayed by 1–2 Gyr relative to the CDM model, independently of the details of SF and feedback. Independent of the dark matter (DM) model, but proportionally to the SF efficiency, gas outflows lower the central mass density through ‘dynamical heating’, such that all realizations have circular velocities <20 km s−1 at 500 pc, in agreement with local kinematic constraints. As a result of dynamical heating, older stars are less centrally concentrated than younger stars, similar to stellar population gradients observed in nearby dwarf galaxies. Introducing an important diagnostic of SF and feedback models, we translate our simulations into artificial colour–magnitude diagrams and star formation histories (SFHs) in order to directly compare to available observations. The simulated galaxies formed most of their stars in many ∼10 Myr long bursts. The CDM galaxy has a global SFH, H i abundance and Fe/H and alpha-elements distribution well matched to current observations of dwarf galaxies.

We simultaneously fit the primary and secondary O − C curves of each system for the light-traveltime effect (LTTE), as well as dynamical perturbations caused by the tertiary on different time-scales. For the first time, we include those contributions of three-body interactions which originate from the eccentric nature of the inner binary. These effects manifest themselves both on the period of the triple system, P2, and on the longer ‘apse-node’ time-scale. We demonstrate that consideration of the dynamically forced rapid apsidal motion yields an efficient and independent tool for the determination of the binary orbit's eccentricity and orientation, as well as the 3D configuration of the triple. Modelling the forced apsidal motion also helps to resolve the degeneracy between the shapes of the LTTE and the dynamical delay terms on the P2 time-scale, due to the strong dependence of the apsidal motion period on the triple's mass ratio. This can lead to the independent determination of the binary and tertiary masses without the need for independent radial velocity measurements. Through the use of our analytic method for fitting O − C curves, we have obtained robust solutions for system parameters for the 10 most ideal triples of our sample, and only somewhat less robust, but yet acceptable, fits for the remaining systems. Finally, we study the results of our 26 system parameter fits via a set of distributions of various physically important parameters, including mutual inclination angle, and mass and period ratios.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208279","methods: analytical;binaries: close;binaries: eclipsing","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here, we continue this research with a detailed study of their past and future motion during previous and next orbital periods under the perturbing action of our Galactic environment. At all stages of our dynamical study, we precisely propagate in time the observational uncertainties of cometary orbits. For the first time in our calculations, we fully take into account individual perturbations from all known stars or stellar systems that closely (less than 3.5 pc) approach the Sun during the cometary motion in the investigated time interval of several million years. This is done by means of a direct numerical integration of the N-body system comprising of a comet, the Sun and 90 potential stellar perturbers. We show a full review of various examples of individual stellar action on cometary motion. We conclude that perturbations from all known stars or stellar systems do not change the overall picture of the past orbit evolution of long-period comets. Their future motion might be seriously perturbed during the predicted close approach of Gliese 710 star but we do not observe significant energy changes. The importance of stellar perturbations is tested on the whole sample of 108 comets investigated by us so far and our previous results, obtained with only Galactic perturbations included, are fully confirmed. We present how our results can be used to discriminate between dynamically new and old near-parabolic comets and discuss the relevance of the so-called Jupiter–Saturn barrier phenomenon. Finally, we show how the Oort spike in the 1/a-distribution of near-parabolic comets is built from both dynamically new and old comets. We also point out that C/2007 W1 seems to be the first serious candidate for interstellar provenance.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208278","comets: general;Oort Cloud","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Cosmological constraints from the CFHTLenS shear measurements using a new, accurate, and flexible way of predicting non-linear mass clustering","R. E. Angulo; S. Hilbert",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","448","1","364","375","We explore the cosmological constraints from cosmic shear using a new way of modelling the non-linear matter correlation functions. The new formalism extends the method of Angulo & White, which manipulates outputs of N-body simulations to represent the 3D non-linear mass distribution in different cosmological scenarios. We show that predictions from our approach for shear two-point correlations at 1–300 arcmin separations are accurate at the ∼10 per cent level, even for extreme changes in cosmology. For moderate changes, with target cosmologies similar to that preferred by analyses of recent Planck data, the accuracy is close to ∼5 per cent. We combine this approach with a Monte Carlo Markov chain sampler to explore constraints on a Λ cold dark matter model from the shear correlation functions measured in the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We obtain constraints on the parameter combination σ8(Ωm/0.27)0.6 = 0.801 ± 0.028. Combined with results from cosmic microwave background data, we obtain marginalized constraints on σ8 = 0.81 ± 0.01 and Ωm = 0.29 ± 0.01. These results are statistically compatible with previous analyses, which supports the validity of our approach. We discuss the advantages of our method and the potential it offers, including a path to model in detail (i) the effects of baryons, (ii) high-order shear correlation functions, and (iii) galaxy–galaxy lensing, among others, in future high-precision cosmological analyses.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208296","gravitational lensing: weak;methods: numerical;cosmological parameters;cosmology: observations;cosmology: theory;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The new exact solution is derived by constructing the non-spherical Green's function in terms of the oblate spheroidal wavefunction. We then apply the exact solution to a generic object whose parameter values are guided by the observations of the rapidly rotating star α Eridani with its eccentricity $\mathcal {E}_{\alpha }= 0.7454$, the most oblate star known. The internal structure and gravitational field of the object are computed from its assumed rotation rate and size. We also compare the exact solution to the three-dimensional numerical solution based on a finite-element method taking full account of rotation-induced shape change and find excellent agreement between the exact solution and the finite-element solution with about 0.001 per cent discrepancy.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208266","planets and satellites: gaseous planets;planets and satellites: interiors;stars: interiors","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The afterglow of a relativistic shock breakout and low-luminosity GRBs","R. Barniol Duran; E. Nakar; T. Piran; R. Sari",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","448","1","417","428","The prompt emission of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (llGRBs) indicates that these events originate from a relativistic shock breakout. In this case, we can estimate, based on the properties of the prompt emission, the energy distribution of the ejecta. We develop a general formalism to estimate the afterglow produced by synchrotron emission from the forward shock resulting from the interaction of this ejecta with the circumburst matter. We assess whether this emission can produce the observed radio and X-ray afterglows of the available sample of four llGRBs. All four radio afterglows can be explained within this model, providing further support for shock breakouts being the origin of llGRBs. We find that in one of the llGRBs (GRB 031203), the predicted X-ray emission, using the same parameters that fit the radio, can explain the observed one. In another one (GRB 980425), the observed X-rays can be explained if we allow for a slight modification of the simplest model. For the last two cases (GRBs 060218 and 100316D), we find that, as is the case for previous attempts to model these afterglows, the simplest model that fits the radio emission underpredicts the observed X-ray afterglows. Using general arguments, we show that the most natural location of the X-ray source is, like the radio source, within the ejecta–external medium interaction layer but that emission is due to a different population of electrons or to a different emission process.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208276","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;methods: analytical;gamma-ray burst: general;gamma-ray burst: individual: GRB 980425, 031203, 060218, 100316D","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We examine this connection by performing a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, exploring a range of parameters based on the galaxy formation model developed in Vogelsberger et al. We examine the effects of AGN feedback, wind mass loading, wind specific energy, and wind metal-loading on the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies with Mhalo > 1011 M⊙. Note that while the V13 model was tuned to match observations including the stellar mass function, no explicit tuning was done for the CGM. The wind energy per unit outflow mass has the most significant effect on the CGM enrichment. High-energy winds launch metals far beyond the virial radius. AGN feedback also has a significant effect, but only at z < 3. We compare to high-redshift Hi and Civ observations. All our simulations produce the observed number of Damped Lyman α Absorbers. At lower column density, several of our simulations produce enough Lyman Limit Systems (LLS) 100 kpc from the galaxy, but in all cases the LLS abundance falls off with distance faster than observations, with too few LLS at 200 kpc. Further, in all models the Civ abundance drops off too sharply with distance, with too little Civ 100–200 kpc from the galaxy. Higher energy wind models produce more extended Civ but also produce less stars, in tension with star formation rate density observations. This highlights the fact that circumgalactic observations are a strong constraint on galactic feedback models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208268","galaxies: formation;intergalactic medium","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We apply this technique to Kepler light curves for 414 binary systems that were identified as having anticorrelated O−C curves for the mid-times of the primary and secondary eclipses, or in the case of non-eclipsing systems, their light-curve minima. This phase tracking approach extracts more information about starspot and binary system behaviour than may be easily obtained from the O−C curves. We confirm the hypothesis of Tran et al. that we can successfully follow the rotational motions of spots on the surfaces of the stars in these binaries. In ∼34 per cent of the systems, the spot rotation is retrograde as viewed in the frame rotating with the orbital motion, while ∼13 per cent show significant prograde spot rotation. The remaining systems show either little spot rotation or erratic behaviour, or sometimes include intervals of both types of behaviour. We discuss the possibility that the relative motions of spots are related to differential rotation of the stars. It is clear from this study that the motions of the starspots in at least 50 per cent of these short-period binaries are not exactly synchronized with the orbits.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208287","binaries: close;binaries: general;stars: rotation;starspots","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By imposing completeness thresholds identical to that of the ALFALFA (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA) survey, and by compiling a mass-, redshift- and environment-matched control sample from the public ALFALFA.40 data release, we calculate gas fraction offsets (Δfgas) for the post-mergers, relative to the control sample. We find that the post-mergers have H i gas fractions that are consistent with undisturbed galaxies. However, due to the relative gas richness of the ALFALFA.40 sample, from which we draw our control sample, our measurements of gas fraction enhancements are likely to be conservative lower limits. Combined with comparable gas fraction measurements by Fertig et al. in a sample of galaxy pairs, who also determine gas fraction offsets consistent with zero, we conclude that there is no evidence for significant neutral gas consumption throughout the merger sequence. From a suite of 75 binary merger simulations we confirm that star formation is expected to decrease the post-merger gas fraction by only 0.06 dex, even several Gyr after the merger. Moreover, in addition to the lack of evidence for gas consumption from gas fraction offsets, the observed H i detection fraction in the complete sample of post-mergers is twice as high as the controls, which suggests that the post-merger gas fractions may actually be enhanced. We demonstrate that a gas fraction enhancement in post-mergers, relative to a stellar mass-matched control sample, would indeed be the natural result of merging randomly drawn pairs from a parent population which exhibits a declining gas fraction with increasing stellar mass.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208260","Galaxies: interactions;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: peculiar","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For a given LSS-GAC plate, the spectra are first processed with a set of nominal spectral response curves (SRCs) and used to derive initial stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature Teff, surface gravity log g and metallicity [Fe/H]) as well as dust reddening E(B − V) of all targeted stars. For each of the 16 spectrographs, several F-type stars with good signal-to-noise ratios are selected as flux standard stars for further, iterative spectral flux calibration. Comparison of spectrophotometric colours, deduced from the flux-calibrated spectra, with the photometric measurements yield average differences of 0.02 ± 0.07 and −0.04 ± 0.09 mag for (g − r) and (g − i), respectively. The relatively large negative offset in (g − i) is because we have opted not to correct for the telluric bands, most notably the atmospheric A band in the wavelength range of the i band. Comparison of LSS-GAC multi-epoch observations of duplicate targets indicates that the algorithm has achieved an accuracy of about 10 per cent in relative flux calibration for the wavelength range 4000–9000 Å. The shapes of SRCs deduced for individual LAMOST spectrographs vary by up to 30 per cent for a given night, and larger for different nights, indicating that the derivation of SRCs for the individual plates is essential to achieve accurate flux calibration for the LAMOST spectra.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208234","techniques: spectroscopic;Galaxy: disk;Galaxy: general;surveys","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Cross-sections for planetary systems interacting with passing stars and binaries","G. Li; F. C. Adams",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","448","1","344","363","Most planetary systems are formed within stellar clusters, and these environments can shape their properties. This paper considers scattering encounters between solar systems and passing cluster members, and calculates the corresponding interaction cross-sections. The target solar systems are generally assumed to have four giant planets, with a variety of starting states, including circular orbits with the semimajor axes of our planets, a more compact configuration, an ultracompact state with multiple mean motion resonances, and systems with massive planets. We then consider the effects of varying the cluster velocity dispersion, the relative importance of binaries versus single stars, different stellar host masses, and finite starting eccentricities of the planetary orbits. For each state of the initial system, we perform an ensemble of numerical scattering experiments and determine the cross-sections for eccentricity increase, inclination angle increase, planet ejection, and capture. This paper reports results from over 2 million individual scattering simulations. Using supporting analytic considerations, and fitting functions to the numerical results, we find a universal formula that gives the cross-sections as a function of stellar host mass, cluster velocity dispersion, starting planetary orbital radius, and final eccentricity. The resulting cross-sections can be used in a wide variety of applications. As one example, we revisit constraints on the birth aggregate of our Solar system due to dynamical scattering and find N ≲ 104 (consistent with previous estimates).","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208277","planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Tanaka",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","448","1","666","680","This work presents the results from our near-infrared spectroscopy of narrow-band-selected Hα emitters (HAEs) in two rich overdensities (PKS 1138−262 at z = 2.2 and USS 1558−003 at z = 2.5) with the Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope. These protoclusters are promising candidates for the most massive class of galaxy clusters seen today (Paper I). The confirmed HAEs in the protoclusters at z > 2 show high excitation levels as characterized by much higher [O iii]/Hβ or [O iii]/Hα line ratios than those of general galaxies at low-z. Such a high excitation level may not only be driven by high specific star formation rates and lower gaseous metallicities, but also be contributed by some other effects. We investigate the environmental dependence of gaseous metallicities by comparing the HAEs in the protoclustrers with those in the general field at similar redshifts. We find that the gaseous metallicities of protocluster galaxies are more chemically enriched than those of field galaxies at a given stellar mass in the range of M⋆ ≲ 1011 M⊙. This can be attributed to many processes, such as intrinsic (or nature) effects, external (or nurture) effects, and/or some systematic sampling effects. The intrinsic (nature) effect leads to the advanced stage of ‘downsizing’ galaxy evolution in protoclusters. On the other hand, the external (nurture) effects include the recycling of chemically enriched gas due to the higher pressure of intergalactic medium and/or stripping of outer gas in the reservoir in protoclusters. We also find that the offset of the mass–metallicity relation in dense environment becomes larger at higher redshifts. This can be naturally understood by the fact that the inflow/outflow rates in star-forming galaxies are much higher at higher redshifts. Therefore, the environmental dependence of such ‘feeding’ and ‘feedback’ mechanisms in galaxy formation is probably playing major roles in producing the offset of the mass–metallicity relation for the protocluster galaxies at z > 2.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208297","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The light curves showed significant and rapid variation in source flux during entire observation. We did not find any signature of pulsations in the light curves. However, a quasi-periodic oscillation at ∼20 mHz was detected in the power density spectrum of the source. The 1–70 keV spectrum was fitted with various continuum models. However, we found that the partially absorbed high-energy cut-off power law and Negative and Positive power law with Exponential cut-off (NPEX) models described the source spectrum well. Iron emission lines at 6.4 and 7.1 keV were detected in the source spectrum. An absorption-like feature at ∼39 keV was detected in the residuals while fitting the data with NPEX model. Considering the feature as cyclotron absorption line, the surface magnetic field of the neutron star was estimated to be ∼3.4 × 1012 G. To understand the cause of rapid variation in the source flux, time-resolved spectroscopy was carried out by dividing the observation into 20 narrow segments. The results obtained from the time-resolved spectroscopy are interpreted as the accretion of inhomogeneously distributed matter in the stellar wind of the supergiant companion star as the cause of observed flux variation in 4U 1700−37. A sharp increase in column density after ∼0.63 orbital phase indicates the presence of an accretion wake that blocks the continuum and produces the eclipse like low-flux segment.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208286","binaries: eclipsing;stars: individual: 4U 1700−37;stars: individual: HD 153919;stars: neutron","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The analysis consisted of both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 μm ratios to Hα and 24 μm emission, which trace the light from star-forming regions, and 3.6 μm emission, which traces the light from the older stellar populations of the galaxies.

In one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at ≤160 μm (and in rare cases potentially at ≤350 μm) originates from dust heated by star-forming regions. In another subset, we found that the emission at ≥250 μm (and sometimes at ≥160 μm) originates from dust heated by the older stellar population. In the rest of the sample, either the results are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contribute equally to the global dust heating. The observed variations in dust heating mechanisms do not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emission and radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dust temperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability in dust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu1841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208233","galaxies: ISM;galaxies: spiral;infrared: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Primordial star formation under the influence of far ultraviolet radiation: 1540 cosmological haloes and the stellar mass distribution","S. Hirano; T. Hosokawa; N. Yoshida; K. Omukai; H. W. Yorke",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","448","1","568","587","We perform a large set of cosmological simulations of early structure formation and follow the formation and evolution of 1540 star-forming gas clouds to derive the mass distribution of primordial stars. The star formation in our cosmological simulations is characterized by two distinct populations, the so-called Population III.1 stars and primordial stars formed under the influence of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation (Population III.2D stars). In this work, we determine the stellar masses by using the dependences on the physical properties of star-forming cloud and/or the external photodissociating intensity from nearby primordial stars, which are derived from the results of 2D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar feedback. The characteristic mass of the Pop III stars is found to be a few hundred solar masses at z ∼ 25, and it gradually shifts to lower masses with decreasing redshift. At high redshifts z > 20, about half of the star-forming gas clouds are exposed to intense FUV radiation and thus give birth to massive Pop III.2D stars. However, the local FUV radiation by nearby Pop III stars becomes weaker at lower redshifts, when typical Pop III stars have smaller masses and the mean physical separation between the stars becomes large owing to cosmic expansion. Therefore, at z < 20, a large fraction of the primordial gas clouds host Pop III.1 stars. At z ≲ 15, the Pop III.1 stars are formed in relatively cool gas clouds due to efficient radiative cooling by H2 and HD molecules; such stars have masses of a few × 10 M⊙. Since the stellar evolution and the final fate are determined by the stellar mass, Pop III stars formed at different epochs play different roles in the early universe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208294","methods: numerical;stars: formation;stars: luminosity function, mass function;stars: Population III;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To do so, we compare two simulations – with and without feedback – both evolved with the moving mesh code arepo. The feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation project, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback from supermassive black holes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as well as the net, inflow of this ‘smooth mode’ gas at all redshifts, regardless of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the temperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z = 2. However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvir decreases substantially, from more than 80 per cent to less than 50 per cent, while the rates of both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this boundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of 2 across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z < 1. (d) The amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy – the ‘halo transit time’ – increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of ≃2–3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible implications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208280","methods: numerical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Although one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) models have been generally successful in interpreting the high-energy emission observed in other BL Lac objects, they are problematic for UHBLs, necessitating very large Doppler factors and/or extremely high minimum Lorentz factors of the emitting leptonic population. In this context, we have investigated alternative scenarios where hadronic emission processes are important, using a newly developed (lepto-)hadronic numerical code to systematically explore the physical parameters of the emission region that reproduces the observed spectra while avoiding the extreme values encountered in pure SSC models. Assuming a fixed Doppler factor δ = 30, two principal parameter regimes are identified, where the high-energy emission is due to: (1) proton-synchrotron radiation, with magnetic fields B ∼ 1–100 G and maximum proton energies Ep; max ≲ 1019 eV; and (2) synchrotron emission from p–γ-induced cascades as well as SSC emission from primary leptons, with B ∼ 0.1–1 G and Ep; max ≲ 1017 eV. This can be realized with plausible, sub-Eddington values for the total (kinetic plus magnetic) power of the emitting plasma, in contrast to hadronic interpretations for other blazar classes that often warrant highly super-Eddington values.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208245","astroparticle physics;radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;relativistic processes;BL Lacertae objects: general;BL Lacertae objects: individual: 1ES 0229+200;BL Lacertae objects: individual: 1ES 0347−121","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Reconciling Planck cluster counts and cosmology? Chandra/XMM instrumental calibration and hydrostatic mass bias","H. Israel; G. Schellenberger; J. Nevalainen; R. Massey; T. H.

Their masses may be underestimated if it is assumed that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium, by an amount bhyd ∼ (20 ± 10) per cent suggested by simulations. We have previously found consistency between a sample of observed Chandra X-ray masses and independent weak lensing measurements. Unfortunately, uncertainties in the instrumental calibration of Chandra and XMM–Newton observatories mean that they measure different temperatures for the same gas. In this paper, we translate that relative instrumental bias into mass bias, and infer that XMM–Newton masses of ∼1014 M⊙ ( ≳ 5 × 1014 M⊙) clusters are unbiased (∼35 per cent lower) compared to weak lensing masses. For massive clusters, Chandra's calibration may thus be more accurate. The opposite appears to be true at the low-mass end. We observe the mass bias to increase with cluster mass, but presence of Eddington bias precludes firm conclusions at this stage. Nevertheless, the systematic Chandra − XMM–Newton difference is important because Planck's detections of massive clusters via the Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) effect are calibrated via XMM–Newton observations. The number of detected SZ clusters are inconsistent with Planck's cosmological measurements of the primary cosmic microwave background. Given the Planck cluster masses, if an (unlikely) uncorrected ∼20 per cent calibration bias existed, this tension would be eased, but not resolved.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208290","gravitational lensing weak;galaxies: clusters: general;cosmology: observations;X-rays: galaxies: clusters","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These candidates are selected with infrared colours sensitive to T dwarf characteristics of methane absorptions and of cool atmospheres. The 1.6-μm methane feature is diagnosed by on–off imaging using an H-band and an intermediate-band methane filter, calibrated to a set of known brown dwarfs of M, L, and T types in the field. Another methane feature at 3.3 μm is traced with the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) [3.6] − [4.5] colour. For cool atmospheres, the H − [4.5] and K − [4.5] colours are utilized. With an additional criterion of mid-infrared brightness to eliminate extragalactic interlopers, a total of 28 T dwarf candidates have been identified. A comprehensive assessment was conducted to estimate the level of contamination of our sample by young stellar variability, by extragalactic sources sharing the same colour behaviour, or by foreground T dwarfs. Though extragalactic sources may contribute up to about half of the false positives, our candidates show close spatial association with the dark cloud, rather than randomly distributed as a background population would have been. Furthermore, even though our candidates are not selected a priori by a colour–magnitude relation, they mostly follow the 1 Myr isochrones, ascertaining their youth. Our selection methodology provides guidance to search for T dwarfs in other star-forming regions. Our candidate list, when comparing with those in the literature, which often rely on a single criterion on cool temperature or methane, is more conservative but should be more secure for follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of a T dwarf sample at the early evolutionary stage.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208247","brown dwarfs;stars: pre-main sequence;ISM: individual objects: L1688","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These clouds host very young stellar clusters where massive star formation takes place. Eventually, some of the stars are ejected from the clusters, becoming runaway stars. These stars move supersonically through the cloud and develop bowshocks where particles can be accelerated up to relativistic energies. As a result, the bowshocks present non-thermal emission, and inject relativistic protons in the cloud. These protons diffuse in the GMC interacting with the matter. We present a model for the non-thermal radiation generated by protons and secondary pairs accelerated in the bowshocks of massive runaway stars within young GMCs. We solve the transport equation for primary protons and secondary pairs as the stars move through the cloud. We present non-thermal emissivity maps in radio and in gamma-rays as a function of time. We obtain X-ray luminosities of the order of ∼1032 erg s−1 and gamma-ray luminosities ∼1034 erg s−1.

In this paper, we extend these results to a three-dimensional model of magnetized Keplerian shear flows. Keeping the kinetic Reynolds number and the magnetic Prandtl number fixed, we investigate two different intermittent regimes by varying the plasma beta parameter. The first regime is characterized by turbulent patterns interrupted by the recurrent emergence of a large-scale coherent structure known as two-channel flow, where the state of the system can be described by a single Fourier mode. The second regime is dominated by the turbulence with sporadic emergence of coherent structures with shapes that are reminiscent of a perturbed channel flow. By computing the Fourier power and phase spectral entropies in three dimensions, we show that the large-scale coherent structures are characterized by a high degree of amplitude-phase synchronization.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208242","accretion, accretion discs;MHD;turbulence;methods: statistical","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that we can learn regularized astrophysical time series using particle filters. Motivated by this result, we proceed by working on raw, irregular light curves. Accurately modelling the underlying dynamics as a continuous autoregressive stochastic process, calibrated using an MCMC we find that the scale variable, τ, is in fact first-order stable across 55 MACHO quasar light curves and thus not correlated with the black hole mass.

"Mass-loss on the red giant branch: the value and metallicity dependence of Reimers’ η in globular clusters","I. McDonald; A. A.

The scaling factors from Reimers and Schröder and Cuntz are used to measure the efficiency of RGB mass-loss for typical stars in 56 well-studied Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The median values among clusters are, respectively, $\eta _{\rm R} = 0.477 \pm 0.070 ^{+0.050}_{-0.062}$ and $\eta _{\rm SC} = 0.172 \pm 0.024 ^{+0.018}_{-0.023}$ (standard deviation and systematic uncertainties, respectively). Over a factor of 200 in iron abundance, η varies by ≲30 per cent, thus mass-loss mechanisms on the RGB have very little metallicity dependence. Any remaining dependence is within the current systematic uncertainties on cluster ages and evolution models. The low standard deviation of η among clusters (≈14 per cent) contrasts with the variety of HB morphologies. Since η incorporates cluster age, this suggests that age accounts for the majority of the ‘second parameter problem’, and that a Reimers-like law provides a good mass-loss model. The remaining spread in η correlates with cluster mass and density, suggesting helium enrichment provides the third parameter explaining HB morphology of GCs. We close by discussing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) mass-loss, finding that the AGB tip luminosity is better reproduced and η has less metallicity dependence if GCs are more co-eval than generally thought.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208274","stars: evolution;stars: horizontal branch;stars: mass-loss;stars: winds, outflows;globular clusters: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that the total mass-loss at inner radii scales roughly linearly with total mass of stars formed, and that the mass loading factor at the virial radius can be several times its value at inner radii because of the swept up hot halo gas. The temperature distribution of the outflowing material in the inner region (∼10 kpc) is bimodal in nature, peaking at 105 K and 106.5 K, responsible for optical and X-ray emission, respectively. The contribution of cold/warm gas with temperature ≤105.5 K to the outflow rate within 10 kpc is ≈0.3–0.5. The warm mass loading factor, η3e5 (T ≤ 3 × 105 K) is related to the mass loading factor at the virial radius (ηv) as ηv ≈ 25 η3e5 (SFR/M⊙ yr−1)−0.15 for a baryon fraction of 0.1 and a starburst period of 50 Myr. We also discuss the effect of multiple bursts that are separated by both short and long periods. The outflow speed at the virial radius is close to the sound speed in the hot halo, ≲ 200 km s−1. We identify two ‘sequences’ of outflowing cold gas at small scales: a fast (≈500 km s−1) sequence, driven by the unshocked free-wind; and a slow sequence (≈± 100 km s−1) at the conical interface of the superwind and the hot halo.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208267","hydrodynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Neither the effect of the magnetically mediated interaction between the star and the disc is well understood. The Mg ii multiplet is a fundamental tracer of TTSs atmospheres and outflows, and is the strongest feature in the near-ultraviolet spectrum of TTSs. The International Ultraviolet Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope data archives provide a unique set to study the main physical compounds contributing to the line profile and to derive the properties of the line formation region. The Mg ii profiles of 44 TTSs with resolution 13 000–30 000 are available in these archives. In this work, we use this data set to measure the main observables: flux, broadening, asymmetry, terminal velocity of the outflow, and the velocity of the discrete absorption components. For some few sources repeated observations are available and variability has been studied. There is a warm wind that at sub-au scales absorbs the blue wing of the Mg ii profiles. The main result found in this work is the correlation between the line broadening, Mg ii flux, terminal velocity of the flow and accretion rate. Both outflow and magnetospheric plasma contribute to the Mg ii flux. The flux–flux correlation between Mg ii and C iv or He ii is confirmed; however, no correlation is found between the Mg ii flux and the UV continuum or the H2 emission.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208244","line: profiles;stars: jets;stars: pre-main-sequence;stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be;stars: winds, outflows;ultraviolet: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The shift occurs because the relative velocity is non-zero only within the sound horizon and thus adds to the correlation function asymmetrically about the BAO peak. We further show that in configuration space the relative velocity has a localized, distinctive signature in the three-point galaxy correlation function (3PCF). In particular, we find that a multipole decomposition is a favourable way to isolate the relative velocity in the 3PCF, and that there is a strong signature in the l = 1 multipole for triangles with two sides around the BAO scale. Finally, we investigate a further compression of the 3PCF to a function of only one triangle side that preserves the localized nature of the relative velocity signature while also nicely separating linear from non-linear bias. We expect that this scheme will substantially lessen the computational burden of finding the relative velocity in the 3PCF. The relative velocity's 3PCF signature can be used to correct the shift induced in the galaxy–galaxy correlation function so that no systematic error due to this effect is introduced into the BAO as used for precision cosmology.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208236","cosmology: theory;distance scale;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such objects would represent the seeds out of which z ≳ 6 supermassive black holes grow. We numerically investigate the radiation–hydrodynamic evolution governing the growth of such seeds via accretion of primordial gas within their parent dark matter halo of virial temperature Tvir ∼ 104 K. We find that the accretion on to a direct collapse black hole of initial mass M0 = 105 M⊙ occurs at an average rate $\skew3\dot{M}_{\bullet } \simeq 1.35 \, \skew3\dot{M}_{\rm Edd} \simeq 0.1 \, \mathrm{M_{{\odot }} \, yr^{-1}}$, is intermittent (duty cycle ≲ 50 per cent) and lasts ≈142 Myr; the system emits on average at super-Eddington luminosities, progressively becoming more luminous as the density of the inner mass shells, directly feeding the central object, increases. Finally, when ≈90 per cent of the gas mass has been accreted (in spite of an average super-Eddington emission) on to the black hole, whose final mass is ∼7 × 106 M⊙, the remaining gas is ejected from the halo due to a powerful radiation burst releasing a peak luminosity Lpeak ∼ 3 × 1045 erg s−1.

NGC 2276 is a remarkable galaxy, as it displays a disturbed morphology at many wavelengths. This is possibly due to gravitational interaction with the central elliptical galaxy of the group. Previous ROSAT and XMM–Newton observations resulted in the detection of extended hot gas emission and of a single very bright (∼1041 erg s−1) ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) candidate. Here, we report on a study of the X-ray sources of NGC 2276 based on Chandra data taken in 2004. Chandra was able to resolve 16 sources, 8 of which are ULXs, and to reveal that the previous ULX candidate is actually composed of a few distinct objects. We construct the luminosity function of NGC 2276, which can be interpreted as dominated by high-mass X-ray binaries, and estimate the star formation rate (SFR) to be ∼5–15 M⊙ yr−1, consistent with the values derived from optical and infrared observations.

In this paper, we revisit the axisymmetric perturbation theory and the resulting growth of structure by taking the realistic thickness of the disc into account. In the unstable regime, which corresponds for thick discs to a Toomre parameter below the critical value Q0, crit = 0.696, we find a fastest growing perturbation wavelength that is always a factor 1.93 times larger than in the classical razor-thin disc approximation. This result is independent of the adopted disc scaleheight and by this independent of temperature and surface density. In order to test the analytical theory, we compare it with a high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of an isothermal gravitationally unstable gas disc with the typical vertical  sech2 density profile and study its break up into rings that subsequently fragment into dense clumps. In the first phase, rings form, that organize themselves discretely, with distances corresponding to the local fastest growing perturbation wavelength. We find that the disc scaleheight has to be resolved initially with five or more grid cells in order to guarantee proper growth of the ring structures, which follow the analytical prediction. These rings later on contract to a thin and dense line, while at the same time accreting more gas from the inter-ring region. It is these dense, circular filaments, that subsequently fragment into a large number of clumps. Contrary to what is typically assumed, the clump sizes are therefore not directly determined by the fastest growing wavelength.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208285","hydrodynamics;instabilities;methods: numerical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that the PAH emission in NGC 2403 is better correlated with emission at 250 μm from dust heated by the diffuse interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and that the 8/250-μm surface brightness ratio is well correlated with the stellar surface brightness as measured at 3.6 μm. This implies that the PAHs in NGC 2403 are intermixed with cold large dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and that the PAHs are excited by the diffuse ISRF. In M83, the PAH emission appears more strongly correlated with 160 μm emission originating from large dust grains heated by star-forming regions. However, the PAH emission in M83 is low where the 24-μm emission peaks within star-forming regions, and enhancements in the 8/160-μm surface brightness ratios appear offset relative to the dust and the star-forming regions within the spiral arms. This suggests that the PAHs observed in the 8 μm band are not excited locally within star-forming regions but either by light escaping non-axisymmetrically from star-forming regions or locally by young, non-photoionizing stars that have migrated downstream from the spiral density waves. The results from just these two galaxies show that PAHs may be excited by different stellar populations in different spiral galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208250","galaxies: individual: M83;galaxies: individual: NGC 2403;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: spiral;infrared: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We examine the gap formation by a planet with a new formulation of one-dimensional viscous discs which takes into account the deviation from Keplerian disc rotation due to the steep gradient of the surface density. This formulation enables us to naturally include the Rayleigh stable condition for the disc rotation. It is found that the derivation from Keplerian disc rotation promotes the radial angular momentum transfer and makes the gap shallower than in the Keplerian case. For deep gaps, this shallowing effect becomes significant due to the Rayleigh condition. In our model, we also take into account the propagation of the density waves excited by the planet, which widens the range of the angular momentum deposition to the disc. The effect of the wave propagation makes the gap wider and shallower than the case with instantaneous wave damping. With these shallowing effects, our one-dimensional gap model is consistent with the recent hydrodynamic simulations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208284","accretion, accretion discs;planets and satellites: formation;protoplanetary discs","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our sample corresponds to optical counterparts of X-ray sources detected from observations with the XMM–Newton satellite, which revealed dozens of possible low-mass young stars not yet known in this region. A sample of 58 young star candidates were selected based on optical spectral features, mainly Hα and lithium lines, observed with multiobjects spectroscopy performed by the Gemini South telescope. Among the candidates, we find 41 confirmed T Tauri and 15 very likely young stars. Based on the Hα emission, the T Tauri stars were distinguished between classical (17 per cent) and weak-lined (83 per cent), but no significant difference was found in the age and mass distribution of these two classes. The characterization of the sample was complemented by near- and mid-infrared data, providing an estimate of ages and masses from the comparison with pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. While half of the young stars have an age of 1–2 Myr or less, only a small fraction (∼25 per cent) shows evidence of IR excess revealing the presence of circumstellar discs. This low fraction is quite rare compared to most young star-forming regions, suggesting that some external factor has accelerated the disc dissipation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208271","stars: pre-main-sequence;ISM: individual objects: Sh 2-296","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By using the bright member galaxies of a large sample of rich clusters identified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we obtain the bright end of composite luminosity functions of cluster galaxies, and study their dependence on cluster dynamical states. After a redshift-evolution correction of absolute magnitude, the luminosity function of member galaxies can be well fitted by a Schechter function when the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are excluded. The absolute magnitudes of BCGs follow a Gaussian function with a characteristic width of about 0.36 mag. We find that the luminosity function of galaxies in more relaxed clusters has a fainter characteristic absolute magnitude (M*), and these clusters have fewer bright non-BCG member galaxies but a brighter BCG. Our results suggest the co-evolution of galaxy population with a cluster dynamical state and support the hierarchical formation scenario of the BCGs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208254","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: luminosity function","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We investigate the broad-band modelling of four SGRBs with evidence for energy injection in their X-ray light curves, applying a physically motivated model in which a newly formed magnetar injects energy into a forward shock as it loses angular momentum along open field lines. By performing an order of magnitude search for the underlying physical parameters in the blast wave, we constrain the characteristic break frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum against their manifestations in the available multiwavelength observations for each burst. The application of the magnetar energy injection profile restricts the successful matches to a limited family of models that are self-consistent within the magnetic dipole spin-down framework. We produce synthetic light curves that describe how the radio signatures of these SGRBs ought to have looked given the restrictions imposed by the available data, and discuss the detectability of these signatures with present-day and near-future radio telescopes. Our results show that both the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the upgraded Very Large Array are now sensitive enough to detect the radio signature within two weeks of trigger in most SGRBs, assuming our sample is representative of the population as a whole. We also find that the upcoming Square Kilometre Array will be sensitive to depths greater than those of our lower limit predictions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208262","gamma-ray burst: general;stars: magnetars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Capture and evolution of dust in planetary mean-motion resonances: a fast, semi-analytic method for generating resonantly trapped disc images","A. Shannon; A. J. Mustill; M.

Such resonantly trapped grains are observed in the Solar system. In extrasolar systems, the exozodiacal light produced by dust grains is expected to be a major obstacle to future missions attempting to directly image terrestrial planets. The patterns made by resonantly trapped dust, however, can be used to infer the presence of planets, and the properties of those planets, if the capture and evolution of the grains can be modelled. This has been done with N-body methods, but such methods are computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness when considering large, slowly evolving grains, and for extrasolar systems with unknown planets and parent bodies, where the possible parameter space for investigation is large. In this work, we present a semi-analytic method for calculating the capture and evolution of dust grains in resonance, which can be orders of magnitude faster than N-body methods. We calibrate the model against N-body simulations, finding excellent agreement for Earth to Neptune mass planets, for a variety of grain sizes, initial eccentricities, and initial semimajor axes. We then apply the model to observations of dust resonantly trapped by the Earth. We find that resonantly trapped, asteroidally produced grains naturally produce the ‘trailing blob’ structure in the zodiacal cloud, while to match the intensity of the blob, most of the cloud must be composed of cometary grains, which owing to their high eccentricity are not captured, but produce a smooth disc.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208295","Earth;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;zodiacal dust;circumstellar matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have used these JHK light curves, along with OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) V and I light curves, to examine the variability of a sample of luminous red giants in the SMC which show prominent long secondary periods (LSPs). The origin of the LSPs is currently unknown. In oxygen-rich stars, we found that while most broad-band colours (e.g. V − I) get redder when an oxygen-rich star dims during its LSP cycle, the J − K colour barely changes and sometimes becomes bluer. We interpret the J − K colour changes as being due to increasing water vapour absorption during declining light caused by the development of a layer of dense cool gas above the photosphere. This result and previous observations which indicate the development of a chromosphere between minimum to maximum light suggest that the LSP phenomenon is associated with the ejection of matter from the stellar photosphere near the beginning of light decline. We explore the possibility that broad-band light variations from the optical to the near-infrared regions can be explained by either dust absorption by ejected matter or large spots on a rotating stellar surface. However, neither model is capable of explaining the observed light variations in a variety of colour–magnitude diagrams. We conclude that some other mechanism is responsible for the light variations associated with LSPs in red giants.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208272","circumstellar matter;infrared: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We match these data using the nmagic made-to-measure method, starting with N-body models for barred discs in different dark matter haloes. We determine the total mass in the bulge volume of the RCGs measurement ( ± 2.2 × ±1.4 × ±1.2 kpc) with unprecedented accuracy and robustness to be 1.84 ± 0.07 × 1010 M⊙. The stellar mass in this volume varies between 1.25 and 1.6 × 1010 M⊙, depending on the amount of dark matter in the bulge. We evaluate the mass-to-light and mass-to-clump ratios in the bulge and compare them to theoretical predictions from population synthesis models. We find a mass-to-light ratio in the K band in the range 0.8–1.1. The models are consistent with a Kroupa or Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), but a Salpeter IMF is ruled out for stellar ages of 10 Gyr. To match predictions from the Zoccali IMF derived from the bulge stellar luminosity function requires ∼40 per cent or ∼ 0.7 × 1010 M⊙ dark matter in the bulge region. The BRAVA data together with the RCGs 3D density imply a low pattern speed for the Galactic B/P bulge of Ωp = 25-30 km s− 1 kpc− 1. This would place the Galaxy among the slow rotators ($\mathcal {R}\ge 1.5$). Finally, we show that the Milky Way's B/P bulge has an off-centred X structure, and that the stellar mass involved in the peanut shape accounts for at least 20 per cent of the stellar mass of the bulge, significantly larger than previously thought.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208299","methods: numerical;Galaxy: bulge;Galaxy: centre;Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics;Galaxy: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, we study the effects of rotation on propagation in the meridional (latitudinal) direction, where the Coriolis force changes from its maximum at the poles to zero at the equator. We find that the zero Coriolis force at the equator, while affecting the structure of the flame, does not prevent its propagation from one hemisphere to another. We also observe structural differences between the flame propagating towards the equator and that propagating towards the pole, the second being faster. In the light of the recent discovery of the low spin frequency of burster IGR J17480-2446 rotating at 11 Hz (for which Coriolis effects should be negligible), we also extend our simulations to slow rotation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208269","hydrodynamics;methods: numerical;stars: neutron;X-rays: bursts","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using 2D spherical particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate particle acceleration in the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere as a function of the injected plasma multiplicity and magnetization. We observe a clear transition from a highly charge-separated magnetosphere for low plasma injection with little current and spin-down power, to a nearly force-free solution for high plasma multiplicity characterized by a prominent equatorial current sheet and high spin-down power. We find significant magnetic dissipation in the current sheet, up to 30 per cent within 5 light-cylinder radii in the high-multiplicity regime. The simulations unambiguously demonstrate that the dissipated Poynting flux is efficiently channelled to the particles in the sheet, close to the Y-point within about 1-2 light-cylinder radii from the star. The mean particle energy in the sheet is given by the upstream plasma magnetization at the light cylinder. The study of particle orbits shows that all energetic particles originate from the boundary layer between the open and the closed field lines. Energetic positrons always stream outwards, while high-energy electrons precipitate back towards the star through the sheet and along the separatrices, which may result in auroral-like emission. Our results suggest that the current sheet and the separatrices may be the main source of high-energy radiation in young pulsars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208292","acceleration of particles;magnetic reconnection;methods: numerical;pulsars: general;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Oscillatory convective modes are very non-adiabatic g− modes and they are present in luminous stars, such as red giants with log L/L⊙ ≳ 3. Finite amplitudes for these modes are confined to the outermost non-adiabatic layers, where the radiative energy flux is more important than the convective energy flux. The periods of oscillatory convection modes increase with luminosity, and the growth times are comparable to the oscillation periods. The LSPs of red giants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are observed to lie on a distinct period–luminosity sequence called sequence D. This sequence D period–luminosity relation is roughly consistent with the predictions for dipole oscillatory convective modes in asymptotic giant branch models if we adopt a mixing length of 1.2 pressure scaleheight (α = 1.2). However, the effective temperature of the red-giant sequence of the LMC is consistent to models with α = 1.9, which predict periods too short by a factor of 2.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196799","convection;stars: AGB and post-AGB;stars: late-type;stars: low-mass;stars: oscillations","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The scheme is able to handle both short and long stopping times and reproduces the short friction time limit, which is not properly handled in other implementations. We apply novel tests to verify its accuracy and limitations, including multidimensional tests that have not been previously applied to the drag-coupled dust problem and which are particularly relevant to self-gravitating protoplanetary discs. Our tests demonstrate several key requirements for accurate simulations of gas–dust mixtures. First, in standard SPH particle jitter can degrade the dust solution, even when the gas density is well reproduced. The use of integral gradients, a Wendland kernel and a large number of neighbours can control this, albeit at a greater computational cost. Secondly, when it is necessary to limit the artificial viscosity we recommend using the Cullen & Dehnen switch, since the alternative, using α ∼ 0.1, can generate a large velocity noise up to σv ≲ 0.3cs in the dust particles. Thirdly, we find that an accurate dust density estimate requires >400 neighbours, since, unlike the gas, the dust particles do not feel regularization forces. This density noise applies to all particle-based two-fluid implementations of dust, irrespective of the hydro solver and could lead to numerically induced fragmentation. Although our tests show accurate dusty gas simulations are possible, care must be taken to minimize the contribution from numerical noise.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196749","hydrodynamics;methods: numerical;planets and satellites: formation;protoplanetary discs;dust, extinction","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We apply a contour-based map analysis technique and identify in the stellar surface density map 244 distinct star-forming structures at various levels of significance. These stellar complexes are found to be organized in a hierarchical fashion with 95 per cent being members of three dominant super-structures located along the star-forming ring. The size distribution of the identified structures and the correlation between their radii and numbers of stellar members show power-law behaviours, as expected from scale-free processes. The self-similar distribution of young stars is further quantified from their autocorrelation function, with a fractal dimension of ∼1.7 for length-scales between ∼20 pc and 2.5 kpc. The young stellar radial distribution sets the extent of the star-forming ring at radial distances between 1 and 2.5 kpc. About 60 per cent of the young stars belong to the detected stellar structures, while the remaining stars are distributed among the complexes, still inside the ring of the galaxy. The analysis of the time-dependent clustering of young populations shows a significant change from a more clustered to a more distributed behaviour in a time-scale of ∼60 Myr. The observed hierarchy in stellar clustering is consistent with star formation being regulated by turbulence across the ring. The rotational velocity difference between the edges of the ring suggests shear as the driving mechanism for this process.

It is shown that the outburst occurred in a symbiotic binary system – an extremely rare configuration for a classical nova outburst to occur in but appropriate for the eruption of a recurrent nova of the T CrB class. We estimate the spectral class of secondary as M5III ± (two sub-classes). The maximum magnitude versus rate of decline relations give an unacceptably large value of 37.5 kpc for the distance. The spectra are typical of the He/N class of novae with strong He I and H lines. The profiles are broad and flat topped with full width at zero intensities approaching 9000–10 000 km s−1 and also have a sharp narrow component superposed which is attributable to emission from the giant's wind. Hot shocked gas, accompanied by X-rays and γ-rays, is expected to form when the high-velocity ejecta from the nova ploughs into the surrounding giant wind. Although X-ray emission was observed no γ-ray emission was reported. It is also puzzling that no signature of a decelerating shock is seen in the NIR, seen in similar systems like RS Oph, V745 Sco and V407 Cyg, as rapid narrowing of the line profiles. The small outburst amplitude and the giant secondary strongly suggest that Nova Sco 2014 could be a recurrent nova.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196775","line: identification;techniques: photometric;techniques: spectroscopic;stars: individual: Nova Scorpii 2014;novae, cataclysmic variables","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Parameterizing the light-curve shape through rise and decline time-scales shows that the two are highly correlated. Magnetar-powered models can reproduce the correlation, with the diversity in rise and decline rates driven by the diffusion time-scale. Circumstellar interaction models can exhibit a similar rise–decline relation, but only for a narrow range of densities, which may be problematic for these models. We find that SLSNe are approximately 3.5 mag brighter and have light curves three times broader than SNe Ibc, but that the intrinsic shapes are similar. There are a number of SLSNe with particularly broad light curves, possibly indicating two progenitor channels, but statistical tests do not cleanly separate two populations. The general spectral evolution is also presented. Velocities measured from Fe II are similar for SLSNe and SNe Ibc, suggesting that diffusion time differences are dominated by mass or opacity. Flat velocity evolution in most SLSNe suggests a dense shell of ejecta. If opacities in SLSNe are similar to other SNe Ibc, the average ejected mass is higher by a factor 2–3. Assuming κ = 0.1 cm2 g−1, we estimate a mean (median) SLSN ejecta mass of 10 M⊙ (6 M⊙), with a range of 3–30 M⊙. Doubling the assumed opacity brings the masses closer to normal SNe Ibc, but with a high-mass tail. The most probable mechanism for generating SLSNe seems to be the core collapse of a very massive hydrogen-poor star, forming a millisecond magnetar.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196764","supernovae: general;supernovae: individual: LSQ14bdq;supernovae: individual: LSQ14mo;supernovae: individual: SN 2013hx","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To shed light into this, we present the results from the MAGellanic Inter-Cloud II (MAGIC II) project aimed at probing the stellar populations in 10 large fields located perpendicular to the main ridge-line of H I in the Inter-Cloud region. We secured these observations of the stellar populations in between the MCs using the WFI (Wide Field Imager) camera on the 2.2 m telescope in La Silla. Using colour–magnitude diagrams, we trace stellar populations across the Inter-Cloud region. In good agreement with MAGIC I, we find significant intermediate-age stars in the Inter-Cloud region as well as young stars of a similar age to the last pericentre passage in between the MCs (∼200 Myr ago). We show here that the young, intermediate-age and old stars have distinct spatial distributions. The young stars correlate well with the H I gas suggesting that they were either recently stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) or formed in situ. The bulk of intermediate-age stars are located mainly in the Bridge region where the H I column density is higher, but they are more spread out than the young stars. They have very similar properties to stars located ∼2 kpc from the SMC centre, suggesting that they were tidally stripped from this region. Finally, the old stars extend to some 8 kpc from the SMC supporting the idea that all galaxies have a large extended metal-poor stellar halo.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196804","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: interactions;Local Group;Magellanic Clouds","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As a use case we apply our method to CFHTLS galaxies. The ordinal classification algorithm treats distinct redshift bins as ordered values, which improves the quality of photometric redshift PDFs, compared with non-ordinal classification architectures. We also propose a new single value point estimate of the galaxy redshift, which can be used to estimate the full redshift PDF of a galaxy sample. This method is competitive in terms of accuracy with contemporary algorithms, which stack the full redshift PDFs of all galaxies in the sample, but requires orders of magnitude less storage space. The methods described in this paper greatly improve the log-likelihood of individual object redshift PDFs, when compared with a popular neural network code (ANNZ). In our use case, this improvement reaches 50 per cent for high-redshift objects (z ≥ 0.75). We show that using these more accurate photometric redshift PDFs will lead to a reduction in the systematic biases by up to a factor of 4, when compared with less accurate PDFs obtained from commonly used methods. The cosmological analyses we examine and find improvement upon are the following: gravitational lensing cluster mass estimates, modelling of angular correlation functions and modelling of cosmic shear correlation functions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196790","catalogues;surveys;galaxies: distances and redshifts","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Their host galaxies therefore represent a unique class of objects tracing star formation across the observable Universe. Indeed, recently accumulated evidence shows that GRB hosts do not differ substantially from general population of galaxies at high (z > 2) redshifts. However, it has been long recognized that the properties of z < 1.5 hosts, compared to general star-forming population, are unusual. To better understand the reasons for the supposed difference in LGRB hosts properties at z < 1.5, we obtained Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-Shooter spectra of six hosts lying in the redshift range of 0.8 < z < 1.3. Some of these hosts have been observed before, yet we still lack well-constrained information on their characteristics such as metallicity, dust extinction and star formation rate (SFR). We search for emission lines in the VLT/X-Shooter spectra of the hosts and measure their fluxes. We perform a detailed analysis, estimating host average extinction, SFRs, metallicities and electron densities where possible. Measured quantities of our hosts are compared to a larger sample of previously observed GRB hosts at z < 2. SFRs and metallicities are measured for all the hosts analysed in this paper and metallicities are well determined for four hosts. The mass–metallicity relation, the fundamental metallicity relation and SFRs derived from our hosts occupy similar parameter space as other host galaxies investigated so far at the same redshift. We therefore conclude that GRB hosts in our sample support the found discrepancy between the properties of low-redshift GRB hosts and the general population of star-forming galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196792","gamma-ray burst: general;galaxies: abundances;galaxies: distances and redshifts","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It has been suggested that multiple scatterings of SN photons by CS dust may explain the non-standard reddening law. In this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of SN photons by CS dust in the infrared (IR) wavelength regime. This effect allows the observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size and the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared (NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived even under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated with the CS dust-scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar reddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe Ia. For SNe Ia in general, the environment at the interstellar scale appears to be responsible for the non-standard extinction law. Furthermore, deeper limits can be obtained using the standard nature of SN Ia NIR light curves. In this application, an upper limit of $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-8}{-}10^{-7} \,\mathrm{M}_{{\odot }}$ yr−1 (for the wind velocity of ∼10 km s−1) is obtained for a mass-loss rate from a progenitor up to ∼0.01 pc, and $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-7}{-}10^{-6} \,\mathrm{M}_{{\odot }}$ yr−1 up to ∼0.1 pc.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196754","Circumstellar matter;stars: mass-loss;supernovae: general;dust, extinction","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This work releases the survey data and demonstrates the utility of scripts that perform automated spectral line fitting on broad-band line data. We describe the line-fitting procedure, evaluate the performance of the method, and provide access to all data and scripts. The scripts are used to characterize the spectra at the positions of three H II regions, each with recombination line emission and molecular line absorption. Towards the most line-dense of the three regions characterized in this work, we detect ∼500 spectral line components of which ∼90 per cent are confidently assigned to H and He recombination lines and to 53 molecular species and their isotopologues. The data reveal extremely sub-thermally excited molecular gas absorbing against the continuum background at two primary velocity components. Based on the line radiation over the full spectra, the molecular abundances and line excitation in the absorbing components appear to vary substantially towards the different positions, possibly indicating that the two gas clouds are located proximate to the star-forming cores instead of within the envelope of Sgr B2. Furthermore, the spatial distributions of species including CS, OCS, SiO, and HNCO indicate that the absorbing gas components likely have high UV-flux. Finally, the data contain line-of-sight absorption by ∼15 molecules observed in translucent gas in the Galactic Centre, bar, and intervening spiral arm clouds, revealing the complex chemistry and clumpy structure of this gas.

The metal-rich sample of DLAs at zabs ∼ 2 probes metallicities as high as the Galactic disc and the most metal-rich dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), permitting an analysis of many elements typically observed in DLAs (Fe, Zn, Cr, Mn, Si, and S) in comparison to stellar abundances observed in the Galaxy and its satellites (in particular dSphs). Our main conclusions are: (1) non-solar [Zn/Fe] abundances in metal-poor Galactic stars and in dSphs over the full metallicity range probed by DLAs, suggest that Zn is not a simple proxy for Fe in DLAs and therefore not a suitable indicator of dust depletion. After correcting for dust depletion, the majority of DLAs have subsolar [Zn/Fe] similar to dSphs; (2) at [Fe/H] ∼ −0.5, a constant [Mn/Fe]∼−0.5 and near-solar [α/Fe] (requiring an assumption about dust depletion) are in better agreement with dwarf galaxies than Galactic disc stars; (3) [α/Zn] is usually solar or subsolar in DLAs. However, although low ratios of [α/Fe] are usually considered more ‘dwarf-like’ than ‘Milky Way-like’, subsolar [Zn/Fe] in Local Group dwarfs leads to supersolar [α/Zn] in the dSphs, in contrast with the DLAs. Therefore, whilst DLAs exhibit some similarities with the Local Group dwarf population, there are also notable differences.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196796","stars: abundances;galaxies: abundances;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: ISM;quasars: absorption lines","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The conserved quantity can restrict the number of non-degenerate equilibria in the gravitational potential of an asteroid. It is concluded that the number of non-degenerate equilibria in the gravitational field of an asteroid varies in pairs and is an odd number. In addition, the conserved quantity can also restrict the kinds of bifurcations of relative equilibria in the gravitational potential of an asteroid when the parameter varies. Furthermore, studies have shown that there exist transcritical bifurcations, quasi-transcritical bifurcations, saddle–node bifurcations, saddle–saddle bifurcations, binary saddle–node bifurcations, supercritical pitchfork bifurcations, and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations for the relative equilibria in the gravitational potential of asteroids. It is found that for the asteroid 216 Kleopatra, when the rotation period varies as a parameter, the number of relative equilibria changes from 7 to 5 to 3 to 1, and the bifurcations for the relative equilibria are saddle–node bifurcations and saddle–saddle bifurcations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196781","methods: analytical;celestial mechanics;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;minor planets, asteroids: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The emitters were selected by a combination of photometric redshift and colour–colour selections, as well as spectroscopic follow-up, including recent spectroscopic observations using DEIMOS and MOSFIRE on the Keck Telescopes and FMOS on Subaru.

We find that this gas is highly concentrated towards the central 100 pc and that its morphology is often symmetrical. Lanes of warm H2 gas are observed only in three cases (NGC 1068, NGC 1386 and Circinus) for which the morphology is much wider and extended than the dust filaments. We conclude that there is no one-to-one correlation between dust and warm gas. This indicates that, if the dust filaments and lanes of warm gas are radial streaming motions of fuelling material, they must represent two different phases of accretion: the dust filaments represent a colder phase than the gas close to the nucleus (within ∼100 pc). We predict that the morphology of the nuclear dust at these scales should resemble that of the cold molecular gas (e.g. CO at 10–40 K), as we show for CenA and NGC 1566 by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations, whereas the inner H2 gas traces a much warmer phase of material identified with warmer (40–500 K) molecular gas such as CO(6–5) or HCN (as shown by ALMA for NGC 1068 and NGC 1097).

The uncertainty of the measurement is dominated by the sky subtraction.

We assign H2 masses to gas particles in the simulations in post-processing using two different prescriptions that depend on the local dust-to-gas ratio and the interstellar radiation field. Both result in H2 galaxy mass functions that agree well with observations in the local and high-redshift Universe. The simulations reproduce the observed scaling relations between the mass of H2 and the stellar mass, star formation rate and stellar surface density. Towards high redshifts, galaxies in the simulations display larger H2 mass fractions and lower H2 depletion time-scales, also in good agreement with observations. The comoving mass density of H2 in units of the critical density, $\Omega _{\rm H_2}$, peaks at z ≈ 1.2–1.5, later than the predicted peak of the cosmic star formation rate activity, at z ≈ 2. This difference stems from the decrease in gas metallicity and increase in interstellar radiation field with redshift, both of which hamper H2 formation. We find that the cosmic H2 budget is dominated by galaxies with $M_{\rm H_2}>10^9\,\rm M_{{\odot }}$, star formation rates $>\,\!\!10\,\rm M_{{\odot }}\,\rm yr^{-1}$ and stellar masses Mstellar > 1010 M⊙, which are readily observable in the optical and near-IR.

If one of those is a neutron star the merger will also emit electromagnetic radiation via three possible channels: gamma-ray bursts and their (possibly orphan) afterglows, Li-Paczynski Macronovae and radio flares. This accompanying electromagnetic radiation is vitally important in confirming the GW detections. It could also reveal a wealth of information regarding the merger and will open a window towards multimessenger astronomy. Identifying and characterizing these counterparts is therefore of utmost importance. In this work, we explore late time radio flares emitted by the dynamically ejected outflows. We build upon previous work and consider the effect of the outflow's non-trivial geometry. Using an approximate method, we estimate the radio light-curves for several ejected matter distributions obtained in numerical simulations. Our method provides an upper limit to the effect of non-sphericity. Together with the spherical estimates, the resulting light curves bound the actual signal. We find that while non-spherical geometries can in principle lead to an enhanced emission, in most cases they result in an increase in the time-scale compared with a corresponding spherical configuration. This would weaken somewhat these signals and might decrease the detection prospects.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196777","gravitational waves;hydrodynamics;binaries: general;gamma-ray burst: general;stars: neutron;radio continuum: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We attempt to keep the method as general as possible, so that it may plausibly be applied to a wide range of modified theories, although tests against simulations are restricted to a subclass of f (R) models at this stage. We show that rescaling allows the power spectrum of matter to be reproduced at the ∼3 per cent level in both real and redshift space up to k = 0.1h Mpc−1 if we change the box size and alter the particle displacement field; this limit can be extended to k = 1h Mpc−1 if we additionally alter halo internal structure. We simultaneously develop an algorithm that can be applied directly to a halo catalogue, in which case the halo mass function and clustering can be reproduced at the ∼5 per cent level.

The outburst was first detected by Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) in 2011 June as an unknown, long-lived (order of days) gamma-ray transient source. We show that its position is consistent with the nucleus of a faint galaxy for which we establish a likely redshift of z = 0.89 based on a single emission line that we interpret as the blended [O II] λ3727 doublet. At this redshift, the peak X-ray/gamma-ray luminosity exceeded 1047 erg s−1, while a spatially coincident optical transient source had i′ ∼ 22 (Mg ∼ −21.4 at z = 0.89) during early observations, ∼20 d after the Swift trigger. These properties place Swift J1112.2−8238 in a very similar region of parameter space to the two previously identified members of this class, Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+0516. As with those events the high-energy emission shows evidence for variability over the first few days, while late-time observations, almost 3 yr post-outburst, demonstrate that it has now switched off. Swift J1112.2−8238 brings the total number of such events observed by Swift to three, interestingly all detected by Swift over a ∼3 month period (<3 per cent of its total lifetime as of 2015 March). While this suggests the possibility that further examples may be uncovered by detailed searches of the BAT archives, the lack of any prime candidates in the years since 2011 means these events are undoubtedly rare.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196762","galaxies: nuclei;gamma-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Correlated supernova (SN) events create converging ‘superbubbles’ in the halo gas. Where these collide, the density increases, driving cooling filaments of low-metallicity gas that feed the disc. At our current numerical resolution (∼20 pc; mgas = 4 × 104 M⊙) we are only able to resolve the most dramatic events; however, as we increase the numerical resolution, we find that the filaments persist for longer, driving continued late-time star formation. This suggests that SN-driven accretion could act as an efficient mechanism for extracting cold gas from the hot halo, driving late-time star formation in disc galaxies. We show that such filament feeding leads to a peak star formation rate of ∼3 M⊙ yr−1, consistent with estimates for the Milky Way (MW). The filaments we resolve extend to ∼50 kpc, reaching column densities of N ∼ 1018 cm−2. We show that such structures can plausibly explain the broad dispersion in Mg II absorption seen along sightlines to quasars. Our results suggest a dual role for stellar feedback in galaxy formation, suppressing hot-mode accretion while promoting cold-mode accretion along filaments. Finally, since the filamentary gas has higher angular momentum than that coming from hot-mode accretion, we show that this leads to the formation of substantially larger gas discs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196743","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: starburst;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The difference in the statistical clustering signal along and across the LOS encodes important information about the geometry of the Universe, its expansion rate and the rate of growth of structure within it. Because the LOS varies across a survey, the standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) based methods of measuring the anisotropic power spectrum (APS) cannot be used for surveys with wide observational footprint, other than to measure the monopole moment. We derive a simple analytic formula to quantify the bias for higher order Legendre moments, and we demonstrate that it is scale independent for a simple survey model, and depends only on the observed area. We derive a similar numerical correction formula for recently proposed alternative estimators of the APS that are based on summing over galaxies rather than using an FFT, and can therefore incorporate a varying LOS. We demonstrate that their bias depends on scale but not on the observed area. For a quadrupole the bias is always less than 1 per cent for $k > 0.01\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{{\rm \tt {-}}1}$ at z > 0.32.

We explicitly compute these two timescales in a generic situation to show that resonances are easily achieved. During an outburst of a transient black hole candidate, the accretion rate of the Keplerian disc as well as the geometry of the Comptonizing cloud change very rapidly. During some period, a resonance condition between the cooling timescale (predominantly by Comptonization) and the infall timescale of the Comptonizing cloud is roughly satisfied. This leads to low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) of the Compton cloud and the consequent oscillation of hard X-rays. In this paper, we explicitly follow black hole candidate H1743−322 during its 2010 outburst. We compute the Compton cooling time and infall time over several days and show that QPOs take place when these two roughly agree within ∼50 per cent, i.e., the resonance condition is generally satisfied. We also confirm that for the sharper LFQPOs (i.e. higher Q-factors) the ratio of the two timescales is very close to 1.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196789","accretion, accretion discs;radiation: dynamics;shock waves;stars: black holes;stars: individual: H1743−322;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Since the claimed emission lines lie around 3.5 keV, we focus on galaxies and galaxy groups (masking the central regions), since these objects emit very little radiation above ∼2 keV and offer a clean background against which to detect emission lines. We develop a formalism for maximizing the signal-to-noise of decaying dark matter emission lines by weighing each X-ray event according to the expected dark matter profile. In total, we examine 81 and 89 galaxies with Chandra and XMM–Newton, respectively, totalling 15.0 and 14.6 Ms of integration time. We find no significant evidence of any emission lines, placing strong constraints on the mixing angle of sterile neutrinos with masses between 4.8 and 12.4 keV. In particular, if the 3.57 keV feature from Bulbul et al. were due to 7.1 keV sterile neutrino emission, we would have detected it at 4.4σ and 11.8σ in our two samples. The most conservative estimates of the systematic uncertainties reduce these constraints to 4.4σ and 7.8σ, or letting the line energy vary between 3.50 and 3.60 keV reduces these constraints to 2.7σ and 11.0σ, respectively.

In general, heat from the core should be stable on time-scales <104 yr, while continuing accretion may produce variations on a range of time-scales. While some quiescent neutron stars (e.g. Cen X-4, Aql X-1) have shown variations in their thermal components on a range of time-scales, several others, particularly those in globular clusters with no detectable non-thermal hard X-rays (fit with a power law), have shown no measurable variations. Here, we constrain the spectral variations of 12 low-mass X-ray binaries in three globular clusters over ∼10 years. We find no evidence of variations in 10 cases, with limits on temperature variations below 11 per cent for the seven qLMXBs without power-law components, and limits on variations below 20 per cent for three other qLMXBs that do show non-thermal emission. However, in two qLMXBs showing power-law components in their spectra (NGC 6440 CX 1 and Terzan 5 CX 12) we find marginal evidence for a 10 per cent decline in temperature, suggesting the presence of continuing low-level accretion. This work adds to the evidence that the thermal X-ray component in quiescent neutron stars without power-law components can be explained by heat deposited in the core during outbursts. Finally, we also investigate the correlation between hydrogen column density (NH) and optical extinction (AV) using our sample and current models of interstellar X-ray absorption, finding NH(cm−2) = (2.81 ± 0.13) × 1021AV.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196798","accretion, accretion discs;stars: neutron;globular clusters: individual: Terzan 5;globular clusters: individual: NGC 6440;globular clusters: individual: NGC 6266;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

All host brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with X-ray cavity systems produced by radio AGN. We find high elemental abundances projected preferentially along the cavities of 16 clusters. The metal-rich plasma was apparently lifted out of the BCGs with the rising X-ray cavities (bubbles) to altitudes between twenty and several hundred kiloparsecs. A relationship between the maximum projected altitude of the uplifted gas (the ‘iron radius’) and jet power is found with the form $R_{\rm Fe} \propto P_{\rm jet}^{0.45}$. The estimated outflow rates are typically tens of solar masses per year but exceed 100 M⊙ yr− 1 in the most powerful AGN. The outflow rates are 10–20 per cent of the cooling rates, and thus alone are unable to offset a cooling inflow. Nevertheless, hot outflows effectively redistribute the cooling gas and may play a significant role at regulating star formation and AGN activity in BCGs and presumably in giant elliptical galaxies. The metallicity distribution overall can be complex, perhaps due to metal-rich gas returning in circulation flows or being blown around in the hot atmospheres. Roughly 15 per cent of the work done by the cavities is expended lifting the metal-enriched gas, implying their nuclear black holes have increased in mass by at least ∼107–109 M⊙. Finally, we show that hot outflows can account for the broad, gas-phase metallicity distribution compared to the stellar light profiles of BCGs, and we consider a possible connection between hot outflows and cold molecular gas flows discovered in recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196795","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: active;X-rays: galaxies: clusters","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

While this approach has been reasonably successful, it is known that galaxies must be described by at least two parameters, as can be seen from the two-parameter Fundamental Plane on which massive early-type galaxies lie. In this paper, we derive a connection between initial dark matter density perturbations in the early Universe and present-day virialized dark matter haloes by assuming simple spherical collapse combined with conservation of mass and energy. We find that z = 0 halo concentration, or alternatively the inner slope of the halo density profile α, is monotonically and positively correlated with the collapse redshift of the halo. This is qualitatively similar to the findings of some previous works based on numerical simulations, with which we compare our results. We then describe how the halo mass and concentration (or inner slope α) can be used as two halo parameters in combination with two parameters of early-type galaxies to create an improved abundance matching scheme. In a forthcoming paper, we will show an application of this scheme to galaxies on the Fundamental Plane.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196787","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes;cosmology: theory;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The accuracy of a centre-of-mass approach to image shift measurement depends on the parameters applied in thresholding the recorded image; however, there exists no analytical prediction for these parameters for extended objects. Motivated by this we present a new method for exploring the parameter space of image shift measurement algorithms, and apply this to optimize the parameters of the algorithm. Using a thresholded, windowed centre of mass, we are able to improve centroid accuracy compared to the typical parabolic fitting approach by a factor of 3 in a signal-to-noise regime typical for solar AO. Exploration of the parameters occurs after initial image cross-correlation with a reference image, so does not require regeneration of correlation images. The results presented employ methods which can be used in real-time to estimate the error on centroids, allowing the system to use real data to optimize parameters, without needing to enter a separate calibration mode. This method can also be applied outside of solar AO to any field which requires the tracking of an extended object.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196756","atmospheric effects;instrumentation: adaptive optics;methods: data analysis;techniques: image processing;sun: granulation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This results in the formation of high-pressure water ice, separating the planetary crust from the liquid ocean and, thus, also from the atmosphere. Therefore, instead of a carbonate–silicate cycle like on the Earth, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is governed by the capability of the ocean to dissolve carbon dioxide (CO2). In our study, we focus on the CO2 cycle between the atmosphere and the ocean which determines the atmospheric CO2 content. The atmospheric amount of CO2 is a fundamental quantity for assessing the potential habitability of the planet's surface because of its strong greenhouse effect, which determines the planetary surface temperature to a large degree. In contrast to the stabilizing carbonate–silicate cycle regulating the long-term CO2 inventory of the Earth atmosphere, we find that the CO2 cycle feedback on ocean planets is negative and has strong destabilizing effects on the planetary climate. By using a chemistry model for oceanic CO2 dissolution and an atmospheric model for exoplanets, we show that the CO2 feedback cycle can severely limit the extension of the habitable zone for ocean planets.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196750","astrobiology;planets and satellites: atmospheres;planets and satellites: oceans;planets and satellites: terrestrial planets","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This method combines N-body cosmological simulations and semi-analytic techniques to extract realistic initial conditions for galaxy mergers. These are then evolved using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, which include dark matter, stars, cold gas in the disc and hot gas in the halo. We show that the satellite mass accretion is not as effective as previously thought, as there is substantial stellar stripping before the final merger. The fraction of stellar disc mass transferred to the bulge is quite low, even in the case of a major merger, mainly due to the dispersion of part of the stellar disc mass into the halo. We confirm the findings of Hopkins et al., that a gas-rich disc is able to survive major mergers more efficiently. The enhanced star formation associated with the merger is not localized to the bulge of galaxy, but a substantial fraction takes place in the disc too. The inclusion of the hot gas reservoir in the galaxy model contributes to reducing the efficiency of bulge formation. Overall, our findings suggest that mergers are not as efficient as previously thought in transforming discs into bulges. This possibly alleviates some of the tensions between observations of bulgeless galaxies and the hierarchical scenario for structure formation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196805","methods: numerical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Tides or dark matter sub-haloes: Which ones are more attractive?","S. Ploeckinger",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","452","4","3742","3751","Young tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) are observed in the tidal debris of gas-rich interacting galaxies. In contrast to what is generally assumed to be the case for isolated dwarf galaxies, TDGs are not embedded in their own dark matter (DM) sub-halo. Hence, they are more sensitive to stellar feedback and could be disrupted on a short time-scale. Detailed numerical and observational studies demonstrate that isolated DM-dominated dwarf galaxies can have lifetimes of more than 10 Gyr. For TDGs that evolve in a tidal field with compressing accelerations equal to the gravitational acceleration within a DM sub-halo typical of an isolated dwarf galaxy, a similar survival time is expected. The tidal acceleration profile depends on the virial mass of the host galaxy and the distance between the TDG and its host. We analytically compare the tidal compression to the gravitational acceleration due to either cuspy or cored DM sub-haloes of various virial masses. For example, the tidal field at a distance of 100 kpc to a host halo of 1013 M⊙ can be as stabilizing as a 109 M⊙ DM sub-halo. By linking the tidal field to the equivalent gravitational field of a DM sub-halo, we can use existing models of isolated dwarfs to estimate the survivability of TDGs. We show that part of the unexpectedly high dynamical masses inferred from observations of some TDGs can be explained by tidal compression and hence TDGs require to contain less unobservable matter to understand their rotation curves.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196738","methods: analytical;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: evolution","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Transition of accretion flow from Keplerian phase to advective phase as a dynamical system","S. R. Rajesh; S. B. R. Chandran",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","452","4","3346","3356","A model for the transition of Keplerian accretion flow to advective phase is proposed. The advective fluid particle in the Keplerian accretion background is modelled using two-phase hydrodynamics. The hydrodynamic equations for the advective phase is reduced to a non-linear dynamical system. For small fluctuation of advective nature for sufficiently small time, a linearized dynamical system in density and radial velocity is obtained. The fluctuation is found to be linearly growing for suitable choice of the values of free parameters. The linear growth is studied as a function of the angular Mach number of the background Keplerian accretion flow. The other parameters of the dynamical system are the radial Mach number of the Keplerian accretion flow, viscosity parameters and gas constants of the Keplerian phase as well as the advective phase and the angular velocity profile of the advective fluid particle. The location of the transition region between Keplerian accretion flow and advective accretion flow is parametrized by the radial Mach number and the angular Mach number of the Keplerian accretion flow. The Keplerian accretion flow is found to be linearly unstable against transition to advective phase only if the radial Mach number greater than or of the order of 10−3. Since radial velocity has no dynamical relevance in Keplerian accretion flow (radial Mach number is very small, and the radial velocity comes only as a drift velocity in the equation of continuity), this means that such a transition is possible only at much inner part of the accretion disc. Appreciable linear growth of the advective fluctuation is possible only if the viscosity parameter of the advective phase has high or intermediate value. This could severely restrict the plausible branches of global solution of the inner advective accretion disc.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196752","accretion, accretion discs;hydrodynamics;instabilities","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By combining with other publicly available intensity data, we achieve the most precise spectrum of the AME measured to date in an individual region, with 13 independent data points between 10 and 50 GHz being dominated by this emission. The four QUIJOTE data points provide the first independent confirmation of the downturn of the AME spectrum at low frequencies, initially unveiled by the COSMOlogical Structures On Medium Angular Scales experiment in this region. Our polarisation maps, which have an angular resolution of ≈1° and a sensitivity of ≈ 25 μK beam−1, are consistent with zero polarisation. We obtain upper limits on the polarisation fraction of Π < 6.3 and <2.8 per cent (95 per cent C.L.), respectively, at 12 and 18 GHz (ΠAME < 10.1 and <3.4 per cent with respect to the residual AME intensity), a frequency range where no AME polarisation observations have been reported to date. The combination of these constraints with those from other experiments confirm that all the magnetic dust models based on single-domain grains, and most of those considering randomly oriented magnetic inclusions, predict higher polarisation levels than is observed towards regions with AME. Also, neither of the two considered models of electric dipole emission seems to be compatible with all the observations together. More stringent constraints of the AME polarisation at 10–40 GHz are necessary to disentangle between different models, to which future QUIJOTE data will contribute.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196734","radiation mechanisms: general;ISM: individual objects: G159.6-18.5;diffuse radiation;radio continuum: ISM","","","","","2","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We create a map of DIB absorption covering about 5000 deg2 and measure correlations with various tracers of the interstellar medium: atomic and molecular hydrogen, dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). After recovering known correlations, we show that each DIB has a different dependence on atomic and molecular hydrogen: while they are all positively correlated with $N_{\rm {H\scriptscriptstyle I}}$, they exhibit a range of behaviours with $N_{\rm {H_2}}$ showing positive, negative or no correlation. We show that a simple parametrization involving only $N_{\rm {H\scriptscriptstyle I}}$ and $N_{\rm {H_2}}$ applied to all the DIBs is sufficient to reproduce a large collection of observational results reported in the literature: it allows us to naturally describe the relations between DIB strength and dust reddening (including the so-called skin effect), the related scatter, DIB pair-wise correlations and families, the affinity for σ/ζ-type environments and other correlations related to molecules. Our approach allows us to characterize DIB dependencies in a simple manner and provides us with a metric to characterize the similarity between different DIBs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196761","methods: statistical;surveys;ISM: lines and bands;ISM: molecules","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The 50 MHz JRO array is arranged in contiguous quarter-arrays (Q) each of which is comprised of 4 × 4 sub-arrays (M), which are referred to as square modules in the Ochs’ manual. In these observations the radar transmission was from two quarter-arrays sharing a common diagonal. Signal reception was via three, quarter-array (Q) receivers and three adjacent (M) module receivers all of the same polarization. This arrangement offered the usual Q–Q and M–M interferometric baseline-pairs as well as new Q–M baselines that were rotated ∼6° from the Q–Q and M–M baselines. For relatively high signal-to-noise ratio meteors, this arrangement yields ambiguity resolution to the horizon and confirms the existence of HARM events. We report results from 2014 August 4 to 5 observations that include interesting new HARM events and also suggest the meteoric origin of high-altitude, altitude-extended transient events we named ‘Dragons’ in our earlier report (Gao & Mathews 2015a).

Given the ambiguity in defining a planar configuration, it is unclear how to interpret the low incidence of the MW and M31 planes in ΛCDM. We investigate the prevalence of satellite planes around galactic mass haloes identified in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that planar structures are very common, and that ∼10 per cent of ΛCDM haloes have even more prominent planes than those present in the Local Group. While ubiquitous, the planes of satellite galaxies show a large diversity in their properties. This precludes using one or two systems as small-scale probes of cosmology, since a large sample of satellite systems is needed to obtain a good measure of the object-to-object variation. This very diversity has been misinterpreted as a discrepancy between the satellite planes observed in the Local Group and ΛCDM predictions. In fact, ∼10 per cent of ΛCDM galactic haloes have planes of satellites that are as infrequent as the MW and M31 planes. The look-elsewhere effect plays an important role in assessing the detection significance of satellite planes and accounting for it leads to overestimating the significance level by a factor of 30 and 100 for the MW and M31 systems, respectively.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196783","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: statistics;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this work I calculate the period of KL oscillations (tKL) exactly in the test particle limit at quadrupole order (TPQ). I explore the parameter space of all hierarchical triples at TPQ and show that except for triples on the boundary between libration and rotation, the period of KL oscillations does not vary by more than a factor of a few. The exact period may be approximated to better than 2 per cent for triples with mutual inclinations between 60° and 120° and initial eccentricities less than ∼0.3. In addition, I derive an analytic expression for the period of octupole-order oscillations due to the ‘eccentric KL mechanism’ (EKM). I show that the time-scale for EKM oscillations is proportional to $\epsilon _{\mathrm {oct}}^{-1/2}$, where ϵoct measures the strength of octupole perturbations relative to quadrupole perturbations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196779","celestial mechanics;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;binaries: close","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have used the Green Bank Telescope and the K-Band Focal Plane Array to map the ammonia (NH3) (1,1) and (2,2) inversion emission at a resolution of 30 arcsec in 8 arcmin regions towards the positions of embedded massive star formation. We have identified a total of 115 distinct clumps, approximately two-thirds of which are associated with an embedded massive young stellar object or compact H II region, while the others are classified as quiescent. There is a strong spatial correlation between the peak NH3 emission and the presence of embedded objects. We derive the spatial distribution of the kinetic gas temperatures, line widths, and NH3 column densities from these maps, and by combining these data with dust emission maps we estimate clump masses, H2 column densities and ammonia abundances. The clumps have typical masses of ∼1000 M⊙ and radii ∼0.5 pc, line widths of ∼2 km s−1 and kinetic temperatures of ∼16–20 K. We find no significant difference between the sizes and masses of the star-forming and quiescent subsamples; however, the distribution maps reveal the presence of temperature and line width gradients peaking towards the centre for the star-forming clumps while the quiescent clumps show relatively uniform temperatures and line widths throughout. Virial analysis suggests that the vast majority of clumps are gravitationally bound and are likely to be in a state of global free fall in the absence of strong magnetic fields. The similarities between the properties of the two subsamples suggest that the quiescent clumps are also likely to form massive stars in the future, and therefore provide an excellent opportunity to study the initial conditions of massive pre-stellar and protostellar clumps.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196759","stars: early-type;stars: formation;ISM: molecules;radio lines: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this work, we study variability properties of the band-limited noise component during the low-hard state for a sample of black hole X-ray binaries. We investigate the characteristic frequency and amplitude of the band-limited noise component and study covariance spectra. For observations that show a noise component with a characteristic frequency above 1 Hz in the hard energy band (4–8 keV), we found this very same component at a lower frequency in the soft band (1–2 keV). This difference in characteristic frequency is an indication that while both the soft and the hard band photons contribute to the same band-limited noise component, which likely represents the modulation of the mass accretion rate, the origin of the soft photons is actually further away from the black hole than the hard photons. Thus, the soft photons are characterized by larger radii, lower frequencies and softer energies, and are probably associated with a smaller optical depth for Comptonization up-scattering from the outer layer of the corona, or suggest a temperature gradient of the corona. We interpret this energy dependence within the picture of energy-dependent power density states as a hint that the contribution of the up-scattered photons originating in the outskirts of the Comptonizing corona to the overall emission in the soft band is becoming significant.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196767","black hole physics;binaries: close;X-rays: binaries;X-rays: individual: H 1743−322, GX 339−4, XTE J1650−500, XTE J1752−223, Swift J1753.5−0127","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The primary method of our approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs), constructed using Spitzer/IRAC (Infrared Array Camera) and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) and Herschel/SPIRE photometry, of 380 radio sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. From the fitted SEDs, we determine the relative AGN and star-forming contributions to their infrared emission. With the inclusion of other AGN diagnostics such as X-ray luminosity, Spitzer/IRAC colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming total infrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 GHz flux density, qIR, we determine whether the radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an AGN. The majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an AGN at some wavelength. Of the sources with AGN signatures, 58 per cent are hybrid systems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. This implies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their star formation have a high AGN fraction. Below a 1.4 GHz flux density of 1 mJy, along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from pure star-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20–65 per cent of the sources. This result suggests that hybrid sources have a significant contribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable AGN, to the observed flattening of the source counts at ∼1 mJy for the extragalactic radio source population.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196794","galaxies: active;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: nuclei;infrared: galaxies;radio continuum: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The shape of the circular velocity profiles of simulated galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass, but shows remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity. This is especially true for low-mass dark-matter-dominated systems, reflecting the expected similarity of the underlying CDM haloes. This is at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, which show a large diversity of rotation curve shapes, even at fixed maximum rotation speed. Some dwarfs have rotation curves that agree well with simulations, others do not. The latter are systems where the inferred mass enclosed in the inner regions is much lower than expected for CDM haloes and include many galaxies where previous work claims the presence of a constant density ‘core’. The ‘cusp versus core’ issue is thus better characterized as an ‘inner mass deficit’ problem than as a density slope mismatch. For several galaxies, the magnitude of this inner mass deficit is well in excess of that reported in recent simulations where cores result from baryon-induced fluctuations in the gravitational potential. We conclude that one or more of the following statements must be true: (i) the dark matter is more complex than envisaged by any current model; (ii) current simulations fail to reproduce the diversity in the effects of baryons on the inner regions of dwarf galaxies; and/or (iii) the mass profiles of ‘inner mass deficit’ galaxies inferred from kinematic data are incorrect.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196757","galaxies: haloes;galaxies: structure;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Laboratory experiments have already proved that when ices containing CH3OH are irradiated with high-energy photons or energetic particles, many chemical primary fragments are formed, due to the dissociation of C-H or O-H bonds. Are these hydrogen-containing molecules chemically stable in dark dust clouds? What is the behaviour of molecules like CH3OH in non-energy-induced processes? An understanding of the thermal reactions between methanol and radical species in their ground states at cryogenic temperatures is of primary importance in the astrochemical context. We experimentally show that the reaction between ground-state nitrogen atoms and CH3OH leads to dehydrogenation processes of methanol to form CH3O, H2CO and HCO chemical fragments via thermal chemistry initiated at temperatures below 10 K. These results underline the problem of the low chemical stability of some species formed and destroyed in interstellar media without any contribution of cosmic ray particles or high-energy photons.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196740","astrochemistry;methods: laboratory;techniques: spectroscopic;ISM: molecules","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The latest work specific to this topic consists of simple yet insightful two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations stressing the role of global flow. To explore how a time-varying disc shadow affects mass transfer, I generalize the geometry, employ a robust hydrodynamics solver, and use phase space analysis near the nozzle to include coriolis lift there. Without even exposing the nozzle, a warped disc's shadow can drive mass transfer cycles by shifting the equatorial edges of the irradiation patches in turns: drawing in denser ambient gas before sweeping it into the nozzle. Other important effects remain missing in two-dimensional models, which I discuss along with prospects for more detailed yet efficient models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196797","hydrodynamics;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We detect a highly significant signal (signal-to-noise-ratio ∼120), allowing us to study the properties of dark matter haloes over one and a half order of magnitude in mass, from M ∼ 1013–1014.5 h−1 M⊙.

We find that the density profiles of the haloes are well described by an NFW profile with concentrations that agree with predictions from numerical simulations. In addition, we constrain scaling relations between the mass and a number of observable group properties.

AUDS has collected 700 h of integration time in two fields with a combined area of 1.35 deg2. In this paper, we present data from 60 per cent of the total survey, corresponding to a sensitivity level of 80 μJy.

The origin of these tidal features is discussed, either coming from a satellite infall or caused by residuals of an ancient, gas-rich major merger. By modelling the formation of the peculiar features observed in the NGC 4013 halo, we investigate their origin. By using GADGET-2 with implemented gas cooling, star formation, and feedback, we have modelled the overall NGC 4013 galaxy and its associated halo features. A gas-rich major merger occurring 2.7–4.6 Gyr ago succeeds in reproducing the NGC 4013 galaxy properties, including all the faint stellar features, strong gas warp, boxy-shaped halo and vertical 3.6 μm luminosity distribution. High gas fractions in the progenitors are sufficient to reproduce the observed thin and thick discs, with a small bulge fraction, as observed. A major merger is able to reproduce the overall NGC 4013 system, including the warp strength, the red colour and the high stellar mass density of the loop, while a minor merger model cannot. Because the gas-rich model suffices to create a pseudo-bulge with a small fraction of the light, NGC 4013 is perhaps the archetype of a late-type galaxy formed by a relatively recent merger. Then late type, pseudo-bulge spirals are not mandatorily made through secular evolution, and the NGC 4013 properties also illustrate that strong warps in isolated galaxies may well occur at a late phase of a gas-rich major merger.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196768","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: individual: NGC 4013;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: spiral","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For a single formation event we are able to match analytical predictions of the memory they retain of each other (complementarity), finding that a large mass accretion rate (≳10−7 M⊙ yr−1) allows for delays on the order of the disc's viscous time-scale between chondrule formation and chondrite accretion. Further, we find older discs to be severely diminished of chondrules, with accretion rates ≲10−9 M⊙ yr−1 for nominal parameters. We then characterize the distribution of chondrule origins in both space and time, as functions of disc parameters and chondrule formation rates, in runs with continuous chondrule formation and both static and evolving discs. Our data suggest that these can account for the observed diversity between distinct chondrite classes, if some diversity in accretion time is allowed for.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196803","astrochemistry – meteorites, meteors, meteoroids;protoplanetary discs","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For that we employ trajectories from a relativistic BNSM model to represent the density–temperature evolutions in our parametric study. In the high-density environment, positron captures decrease the neutron richness at the high temperatures predicted by the hydrodynamic simulation. Circumventing the complexities of modelling three-dimensional neutrino transport, (anti)neutrino captures are parametrized in terms of prescribed neutrino luminosities and mean energies, guided by published results and assumed as constant in time. Depending sensitively on the adopted νe–$\bar{\nu }_{\rm e}$ luminosity ratio, neutrino processes increase Ye to values between 0.25 and 0.40, still allowing for a successful r-process compatible with the observed solar abundance distribution and a significant fraction of the ejecta consisting of r-process nuclei. If the νe luminosities and mean energies are relatively large compared to the $\bar{\nu }_{\rm e}$ properties, the mean Ye might reach values >0.40 so that neutrino captures seriously compromise the success of the r-process. In this case, the r-abundances remain compatible with the solar distribution, but the total amount of ejected r-material is reduced to a few per cent, because the production of iron-peak elements is favoured. Proper neutrino physics, in particular also neutrino absorption, have to be included in BNSM simulations before final conclusions can be drawn concerning r-processing in this environment and concerning observational consequences like kilonovae, whose peak brightness and colour temperature are sensitive to the composition-dependent opacity of the ejecta.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196765","dense matter;hydrodynamics;neutrinos;nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances;stars: neutron","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The dipolar magnetic field of this source, $B=6\,{\times\, 10^{12}}{\,{\rm G}}$ estimated from its spin-down rate, is in the observed range of magnetic fields for normal pulsars. The source is further characterized by a high pulse fraction and a single-peak profile. Using synthetic temperature distribution profiles, and fully accounting for the general-relativistic effects of light deflection and gravitational redshift, we generate synthetic X-ray spectra and pulse profiles that we fit to the observations. We find that asymmetric and symmetric surface temperature distributions can reproduce equally well the observed pulse profiles and spectra of SGR 0418. None the less, the modelling allows us to place constraints on the system geometry (i.e. the angles ψ and ξ that the rotation axis makes with the line of sight and the dipolar axis, respectively), as well as on the spot size and temperature contrast on the neutron star surface. After performing an analysis iterating between the pulse profile and spectra, as done in similar previous works, we further employed, for the first time in this context, a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach to extract constraints on the model parameters from the pulse profiles and spectra, simultaneously. We find that, to reproduce the observed spectrum and flux modulation: (a) the angles must be restricted to 65° ≲ ψ + ξ ≲ 125° or 235° ≲ ψ + ξ ≲ 295°; (b) the temperature contrast between the poles and the equator must be at least a factor of ∼6, and (c) the size of the hottest region ranges between 0.2 and 0.7 km (including uncertainties on the source distance).

We performed the first measurements of Kr, Fe, and recombination O abundance in this PN. The extremely small [Fe/H] implies that most Fe atoms are in the solid phase, considering into account the abundance of [Ar/H]. The Spitzer/IRS spectrum displays broad 16–24 μm and 30 μm features, as well as PAH bands at 6–9 and 10–14 μm. The unidentified broad 16–24 μm feature may not be related to iron sulphide (FeS), amorphous silicate, or PAHs. Using the spectral energy distribution model, we derived the luminosity and effective temperature of the central star, and the gas and dust masses. The observed elemental abundances and derived gas mass are in good agreement with asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis models for an initial mass of 1.90 M⊙ and a metallicity of Z = 0.004. We infer that respectively about 80, 50, and 90 per cent of the Mg, S, and Fe atoms are in the solid phase. We also assessed the maximum possible magnesium sulphide (MgS) and iron-rich sulphide (Fe50S) masses and tested whether these species can produce the band flux of the observed 30 μm feature. Depending on what fraction of the sulphur is in sulphide molecules such as CS, we conclude that MgS and Fe50S could be possible carriers of the 30 μm feature in this PN.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196780","ISM: abundances;dust, extinction;planetary nebulae: individual: Wray16-423","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such rare systems occur due to ‘bulls-eye’ encounters between two reasonably matched galaxies. The recessional velocity of about 840 km s−1 is low enough that it was detected in the Anglo-Australian Observatory/UK Schmidt Telescope Survey for Galactic H α emission. The distance is only ∼10 Mpc and the main galaxy shows a full ring of star-forming knots, 6.1 kpc in diameter surrounding a quiescent disc. The smaller assumed ‘bullet’ galaxy also shows vigorous star formation. The spectacular nature of the object had been overlooked because of its location in the Galactic plane and proximity to a bright star and even though it is the 60th brightest galaxy in the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) H I survey. The overall system has a physical size of ∼15 kpc, a total mass of M* = 6.6 × 109 M⊙ (stars + H I), a metallicity of [O/H]∼ −0.4, and a star formation rate of 0.2–0.5 M⊙ yr−1, making it a Magellanic-type system. Collisional ring galaxies therefore extend to much lower galaxy masses than commonly assumed. We derive a space density for such systems of 7 × 10− 5 Mpc− 3, an order of magnitude higher than previously estimated. This space density suggests Kathryn's Wheel is the nearest such system. We present discovery images, CTIO 4-m telescope narrow-band follow-up images and spectroscopy for selected emission components. Given its proximity and modest extinction along the line of sight, this spectacular system provides an ideal target for future high spatial resolution studies of such systems and for direct detection of its stellar populations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196739","galaxies: groups: general;galaxies: individual (ESO 179-13);galaxies: interactions;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Radio-loud AGN are classified as high-excitation and low-excitation radio galaxies using their emission lines and WISE 22-μm luminosity. AGN accretion and jet powers in these active galaxies are traced by [O III] emission-line and radio luminosity, respectively. Star formation rates (SFRs) and specific star formation rates (SSFRs) were derived using Herschel 250-μm luminosity and stellar mass measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey–Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics-John Hopkins University catalogue. In the past, star formation studies of AGN have mostly focused on high-redshift sources to observe the thermal dust emission that peaks in the far-infrared, which limited the samples to powerful objects. However, with Herschel we can expand this to low redshifts. Our stacking analyses show that SFRs and SSFRs of both radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN increase with increasing AGN power but that radio-loud AGN tend to have lower SFR. Additionally, radio-quiet AGN are found to have approximately an order of magnitude higher SSFRs than radio-loud AGN for a given level of AGN power. The difference between the star formation properties of radio-loud and -quiet AGN is also seen in samples matched in stellar mass.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196755","galaxies: active;infrared: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Data on individual galaxies are presented and the accuracy of the measured velocities is discussed. Dynamical properties of the cluster are derived. We obtain an improved mean redshift value z = 0.31665 ± 0.0008 and velocity dispersion $\sigma = 1893^{+73}_{-82}\ {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. A large velocity dispersion within the core radius and the shape of the infall pattern suggests that this part of the cluster is in a radial phase of relaxation with a very elongated radial filament spanning 12 000 km s−1. A radial foreground structure is detected within the central 0.5 h−1 Mpc radius, recognizable as a redshift group at the same central redshift value. We analyse the colour distribution for this archetype Butcher–Oemler galaxy cluster and identify the separate red and blue galaxy sequences. The latter subset contains 44 per cent of confirmed members of the cluster, reaching magnitudes as faint as Rf= 21.1 (1.0 mag fainter than previous studies).

The extragalactic background radiation contains all the energy generated by nuclear fusion in stars since the big bang. By resolving this background radiation into individual galaxies using the deepest far-infrared survey with the Herschel Space Observatory and a deep near-infrared/optical survey with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and using measurements of the Sérsic index of these galaxies derived from the HST images, we estimate that ≃83 per cent of the stellar mass-density formed over the history of the Universe occurred in LTGs.

Such parent population proved to be very elusive, and escaped direct detection in radio surveys so far. High-redshift blazars themselves seem to be failing in producing extended radio lobes, raising questions about the connection between such class and the vaster population of radio galaxies. We show that the interaction of the jet electrons with the intense cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation explains the lack of extended radio emission in high-redshift blazars and in their parent population, helping to explain the apparently missing misaligned counterparts of high-redshift blazars. On the other hand, the emission from the more compact and more magnetized hotspots are less affected by the enhanced CMB energy density. By modelling the spectral energy distribution of blazar lobes and hotspots, we find that most of them should be detectable by low-frequency deep radio observations, e.g. by LOw-Frequency ARray for radio astronomy and by relatively deep X-ray observations with good angular resolution, e.g. by the Chandra satellite. At high redshifts, the emission of a misaligned relativistic jet, being debeamed, is missed by current large sky area surveys. The isotropic flux produced in the hotspots can be below ∼1 mJy and the isotropic lobe radio emission is quenched by the CMB cooling. Consequently, even sources with very powerful jets can go undetected in current radio surveys, and misclassified as radio-quiet AGNs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196773","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;BL Lacertae objects: general;quasars: general;X-rays: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This can be explained in a Lagrangian framework, by identifying the specific long-wavelength correlations within the primordial Gaussian random field (GRF), which are relevant to spin acquisition. Tidal torque theory is revisited in the context of such anisotropic environments, biased by the presence of a filament within a wall. The point process of filament-type saddles represents it most efficiently. The constrained misalignment between the tidal and the inertia tensors in the vicinity of filament-type saddles simply explains the distribution of spin directions. This misalignment implies in particular an azimuthal orientation for the spins of more massive galaxies and a spin alignment with the filament for less massive galaxies. This prediction is found to be in qualitative agreement with measurements in GRFs and N-body simulations. It relates the transition mass to the geometry of the saddle, and accordingly predicts its measured scaling with the mass of non-linearity. Implications for galaxy formation and weak lensing are briefly discussed, as is the dual theory of spin alignments in walls.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196793","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;cosmology: theory;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use the same approach we have adopted for the 1:1 spin-orbit case with a peculiar attention to the role of Mercury's non-negligible eccentricity. The selected parameters are the polar moment of inertia, the Mercury's inclination and eccentricity and the precession rates of the perihelion and node. Our study produces a bound to both the latitudinal and longitudinal librations (of 0.1 rad) for a long but finite time (greatly exceeding the age of the Solar system). This is the so-called effective stability time.

The total sample is heterogeneous, including galaxies in an all-sky radio survey, hard X-ray-emitting sources, a type 2 quasar (QSR)identified as a X-ray source, a type 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) at high z (3.7), a very extended Lyα-emitting nebula, objects in a multi-band imaging survey for Lyman-break galaxies and in a slitless spectroscopic survey for Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs), etc. We also present UV line predictions for a sample of galaxies in the 0.0686 < z < 0.8829 range. For calculation of the line and continuum spectra, we use the code SUMA, which accounts consistently for photoionizing flux from an external source and shocks. Dust-reprocessed radiation is also calculated. The results show that calculated Lyα/Hβ values are generally higher than observed, except for a few starburst (SB)-dominated models. Some spectra are better reproduced by shock-dominated models. The sample of galaxies including the Lyα line shows neither peculiar gas physical conditions nor abnormal element abundances. The line profiles have complex full widths at half maximum (FWHM) with two main components, which translate into two types of emitting gas clouds. High T* values (>105 K), which indicate that SB stars are close to outburst, were found in a few objects. Traces of supernova events are suggested by a scandium emission line from the SST24 nebula and by shock-dominated models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196742","radiation mechanisms: general;shock waves;ISM: abundances;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: Seyfert;galaxies: starburst","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Comparison between the evolutionary yields of elements such as CNO and the corresponding observed chemical abundances is a powerful tool to shed light on evolutionary processes such as hot bottom burning (HBB) and third dredge-up (TDU). We found that the occurrence of HBB is needed to interpret the nitrogen-enriched (log (N/H) + 12 > 8) PNe. In particular, N-rich PNe with the lowest carbon content are nicely reproduced by AGB models of mass M ≥ 6 M⊙, whose surface chemistry reflects the pure effects of HBB. PNe with log (N/H) + 12 < 7.5 correspond to ejecta of stars that have not experienced HBB, with initial mass below ∼3 M⊙. Some of these stars show very large carbon abundances, owing to the many TDU episodes experienced. We found from our LMC PN sample that there is a threshold to the amount of carbon accumulated at AGB surfaces, log (C/H) + 12 < 9. Confirmation of this constraint would indicate that, after the C-star stage is reached, AGBs experience only a few thermal pulses, which suggests a rapid loss of the external mantle, probably owing to the effects of radiation pressure on carbonaceous dust particles present in the circumstellar envelope. The implications of these findings for AGB evolution theories and the need to extend the PN sample currently available are discussed.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196800","stars: abundances;stars: AGB and post-AGB;stars: carbon","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our results can fully explain recent observations of transition discs in the Chamaleon and Lupus star-forming regions from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey, which shows a higher median for the 70 μm (Herschel PACS 1) band of known transition objects compared with primordial discs. Our theoretical results hence support the suggestion that the 70 μm band may be a powerful diagnostic for the identification of transition discs from photometry data, provided that the inner hole is larger than tens of au, depending on spectral type. Furthermore, we show that a comparison of photometry in the K, 12 μm and 70 μm bands to model tracks can provide a rough, but quick estimate of the inner hole size of these objects, provided their inclination is below ∼85° and the inner hole size is again larger than tens of au.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196766","protoplanetary discs","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Since haloes generally align with their filaments, this introduces a bias in the measurement of the cosmic shear from weak lensing. It is therefore vitally important to understand why this difference arises. We explore the stability of different disc orientations within triaxial haloes. We show that, in the absence of gas, the disc orientation is most stable when its spin is along the minor axis of the halo. Instead when gas cools on to a disc, it is able to form in almost arbitrary orientation, including off the main planes of the halo (but avoiding an orientation perpendicular to the halo's intermediate axis). Substructure helps gasless galaxies reach alignment with the halo faster, but has less effect on galaxies when gas is cooling on to the disc. Our results provide a novel and natural interpretation for why red, gas poor galaxies are preferentially aligned with their halo, while blue, star-forming, galaxies have nearly random orientations, without requiring a connection between galaxies’ current star formation rate and their merger history.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196786","Galaxy: halo;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: fundamental parameters;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our regularization technique significantly reduces mesh noise that is attributed to changes in mesh topology and deviations from mesh regularity. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on various test problems, and note in particular improvements obtained in handling shear instabilities, mixing, and in angular momentum conservation. Calculations of adiabatic jets in which shear excites Kelvin–Helmholtz instability show reduction of mesh noise and entropy generation.

Here, we extend recently developed analytic models for turbulent fragmentation to follow the time-dependent hierarchical fragmentation of self-gravitating cores, until they reach effectively infinite density (and form stars). We show that turbulent fragmentation robustly predicts two key features of the initial mass function (IMF). First, a high-mass power-law scaling very close to the Salpeter slope, which is a generic consequence of the scale-free nature of turbulence and self-gravity. We predict the IMF slope (−2.3) is slightly steeper than the CMF slope (−2.1), owing to the slower collapse and easier fragmentation of large cores. Secondly, a turnover mass, which is set by a combination of the CMF turnover mass (a couple solar masses, determined by the ‘sonic scale’ of galactic turbulence, and so weakly dependent on galaxy properties), and the equation of state (EOS). A ‘soft’ EOS with polytropic index γ < 1.0 predicts that the IMF slope becomes ‘shallow’ below the sonic scale, but fails to produce the full turnover observed. An EOS, which becomes ‘stiff’ at sufficiently low surface densities Σgas ∼ 5000 M⊙ pc−2, and/or models, where each collapsing core is able to heat and effectively stiffen the EOS of a modest mass (∼0.02 M⊙) of surrounding gas, are able to reproduce the observed turnover.

We find that a vortex is destroyed by dust feedback when the total dust-to-gas mass ratio within the vortex is larger than 30–50 per cent, independent of the dust size. The dust distribution can still be asymmetric in some cases after the vortex has been destroyed. With smaller amounts of dust, a vortex can survive for at least 100 orbits, and the maximum dust surface density within the vortex can be more than 100 times larger than the gas surface density, potentially facilitating planetesimal formation. On the other hand, in these stable vortices, small (ts < Ω−1) and large (ts ≳ Ω−1) dust grains concentrate differently and affect the gas dynamics in different ways. The distribution of large dust is more elongated than that of small dust. Large dust (ts ≳ Ω−1) concentrates in the centre of the vortex and feedback leads to turn-over in vorticity towards the centre, forming a quiescent region within an anticyclonic vortex. Such a turn-over is absent if the vortex is loaded with small grains. We demonstrate that, in protoplanetary discs where both large and small dust grains are present and under the right condition, the concentration of large dust towards the vortex centre can lead to a quiescent centre, repelling the small dust and forming a small dust ring around the vortex centre. Such anticorrelations between small and large dust within vortices may explain the discrepancy between Atacama Large Millimeter Array and near-IR scattered light observations in the asymmetric region of transitional discs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208613","circumstellar matter;infrared: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Relevant environments include the cool interstellar medium (ISM) in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, early enriched clouds at the reionization and Pop-II star formation era, and in dense cold gas exposed to intense X-ray or cosmic ray sources. We focus on the behaviour for H2, CO, CH, OH, H2O and O2, at gas temperatures ∼100 K, characteristic of a cooled ISM at low metallicities. We consider shielded or partially shielded one-zone gas parcels, and solve the gas-phase chemical rate equations for the steady-state ‘metal-molecule abundances for a wide range of ionization parameters, ζ/n, and metallicties, Z ′. We find that the OH abundances are always maximal near the H-to-H2 conversion points, and that large OH abundances persist at very low metallicities even when the hydrogen is predominantly atomic. We study the OH/O2, C/CO and OH/CO abundance ratios, from large to small, as functions of ζ/n and Z ′. Much of the cold dense ISM for the Pop-II generation may have been OH-dominated and atomic rather than CO-dominated and molecular.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208628","cosmic rays;ISM: molecules;galaxies: abundances;dark ages, reionization, first stars;X-rays: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Its redshift is constrained by intergalactic absorption lines in the range 0.4 < z < 0.58. The MAGIC telescopes have monitored the source's activity since 2005. In early 2012, PG 1553+113 was found in a high state, and later, in April of the same year, the source reached its highest VHE flux state detected so far. Simultaneous observations carried out in X-rays during 2012 April show similar flaring behaviour. In contrast, the γ-ray flux at E < 100 GeV observed by Fermi-LAT is compatible with steady emission. In this paper, a detailed study of the flaring state is presented. The VHE spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fitted either by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. A simple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the PG 1553+113 VHE γ-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probability P = 2.6 × 10−6). The observed curvature is compatible with the extragalactic background light (EBL) imprint predicted by current generation EBL models assuming a redshift z ∼ 0.4. New constraints on the redshift are derived from the VHE spectrum. These constraints are compatible with previous limits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the optical lower limit, z = 0.4, based on the detection of Lyα absorption. Finally, we find that the synchrotron self-Compton model gives a satisfactory description of the observed multiwavelength spectral energy distribution during the flare.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208604","galaxies: active;BL Lacertae objects: general;BL Lacertae objects: individual: PG1553+113;cosmic background radiation;gamma-rays: galaxies;gamma-rays: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our survey was carried out at the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope Telescope in Chile and Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii covering both hemispheres. The data reveal that extended H2 emission is a good tracer of outflow activity, which is a signpost of accretion process on young massive stars. Almost half of the sample exhibit extended H2 emission and 74 sources (21 per cent) have polar morphology, suggesting collimated outflows. The polar-like structures are more likely to appear on radio-quiet sources, indicating these structures occur during the pre-UCH II phase. We also found an important fraction of sources associated with fluorescent H2 diffuse emission that could be due to a more evolved phase. The images also indicate only ∼23 per cent (80) of the sample is associated with extant (young) stellar clusters. These results support the scenario in which massive stars are formed by accretion discs, since the merging of low-mass stars would not produce outflow structures.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208659","stars: early-type;stars: formation;stars: massive;stars: pre-main-sequence;ISM: jets and outflows;infrared: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Nearby dwarfs show a wide diversity of SFHs; from ancient systems that completed their star formation (SF) ∼10 Gyr ago to young dwarfs that formed the majority of their stars in the past ∼5 Gyr to ‘two-component’ systems characterized by the overlap of old and young stars. As an ensemble, SF in nearby dwarfs dips to lower-than-average rates at intermediate times (4 < t/Gyr < 8), a feature caused in the simulation by cosmic reionization. Reionization heats the gas and drives it out of low-mass haloes, affecting especially systems with virial temperatures of ∼2 × 104 K at zreion. SF begins before zreion in systems above this threshold; its associated feedback compounds the effects of reionization, emptying the haloes of gas and leaving behind old stellar systems. In haloes below the threshold at zreion, reionization leads to a delay in the onset of SF that lasts until the halo grows massive enough to allow gas to cool and form stars, leading to a system with a prominent young stellar component. ‘Two-component’ systems may be traced to late accretion events that allow young stars to form in systems slightly above the threshold at zreion. The dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearby dwarfs might be the clearest signature of the imprint of cosmic reionization on the SFHs of dwarf galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208663","galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;Local Group;galaxies: stellar content;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Two systems comprising a hot subdwarf paired with a bright main-sequence/giant companion display short-period photometric variations possibly due to irradiation or stellar activity and are also short-period candidates. All except two candidates were drawn from a selection of subluminous stars in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ultraviolet sky survey.

The mass functions of the newly identified binaries imply minimum secondary masses ranging from 0.03 to 0.39 M⊙. Photometric time series suggest that, apart from GALEX J0805−1058 and J2205−3141, the companions are most likely white dwarfs. We update the binary population statistics: close to 40 per cent of hot subdwarfs have a companion. Also, we found that the secondary mass distribution shows a low-mass peak attributed to late-type dwarfs, and a higher mass peak and tail distribution attributed to white dwarfs and a few spectroscopic composites.

Assessing the role of the evolution is crucial to study the formation and evolution of massive haloes and to avoid biases in the calibration. We present a general method to infer the mass and the redshift dependence, and the time-evolving intrinsic scatter of the mass–observable relations. The procedure self-calibrates the redshift-dependent completeness function of the sample. The intrinsic scatter in the mass estimates used to calibrate the relation is considered too. We apply the method to the scaling of mass $M_\Delta$ versus line-of-sight galaxy velocity dispersion σv, optical richness, X-ray luminosity, LX, and Sunyaev–Zel'dovich signal. Masses were calibrated with weak lensing measurements. The measured relations are in good agreement with time and mass dependences predicted in the self-similar scenario of structure formation. The lone exception is the $L_\mathrm{X} {\rm -} M_\Delta$ relation, whose time evolution is negative in agreement with formation scenarios with additional radiative cooling and uniform preheating at high redshift. The intrinsic scatter in the $\sigma _\mathrm{v} {\rm -} M_\Delta$ relation is notably small, of the order of 14 per cent.

A 2 deg2 field capturing the Carina Arm around the young massive star cluster, Westerlund 2, is examined. The confirmed OB stars in this cluster are used to validate our identification method, based on selection from the (u − g, g − r) diagram for the region. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method combines VPHAS+ u, g, r, i with published J, H, K photometry in order to derive posterior probability distributions of the stellar parameters log (Teff) and distance modulus, together with the reddening parameters A0 and RV. The stellar parameters are sufficient to confirm OB status while the reddening parameters are determined to a precision of σ(A0) ∼ 0.09 and σ(RV) ∼ 0.08. There are 489 objects that fit well as new OB candidates, earlier than ∼B2. This total includes 74 probable massive O stars, 5 likely blue supergiants and 32 reddened subdwarfs. This increases the number of previously known and candidate OB stars in the region by nearly a factor of 10. Most of the new objects are likely to be at distances between 3 and 6 kpc.

Arm 1 appears to retain the original and poorly disturbed radial distribution. We trace the kinematics of the system up to 78 kpc using the Hα emission, which matches well that provided by the H I. We estimate that the gas existing at large galactocentric radii had a metallicity of 12+log(O/H) ∼ 8.1 before the interaction started around 400 Myr ago.

The largest filaments can reach up to Galactic scale as part of the spiral arm structure. However, such large-scale filaments are hard to identify systematically due to limitations in identifying methodology (i.e. as extinction features). We present a new approach to directly search for the largest, coldest, and densest filaments in the Galaxy, making use of sensitive Herschel Hi-GAL (Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey) data complemented by spectral line cubes. We present a sample of the nine most prominent Herschel filaments, including six identified from a pilot search field plus three from outside the field. These filaments measure 37–99 pc long and 0.6–3.0 pc wide with masses (0.5–8.3) × 104 M⊙, and beam-averaged (28 arcsec, or 0.4–0.7 pc) peak H2 column densities of (1.7–9.3)× 1022 cm− 2. The bulk of the filaments are relatively cold (17–21 K), while some local clumps have a dust temperature up to 25–47 K. All the filaments are located within ≲60 pc from the Galactic mid-plane. Comparing the filaments to a recent spiral arm model incorporating the latest parallax measurements, we find that 7/9 of them reside within arms, but most are close to arm edges. These filaments are comparable in length to the Galactic scaleheight and therefore are not simply part of a grander turbulent cascade.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208590","catalogues;stars: formation;ISM: clouds;ISM: structure;Galaxy: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We investigate the properties of this source from radio to γ-rays. The broad emission lines in the optical and ultraviolet bands and steep radio spectrum indicate a possible classification as an intermediate object between broad-line radio galaxies (BLRG) and steep spectrum radio quasars (SSRQ). On pc-scales PKS 0521−36 shows a knotty structure similar to misaligned AGN. The core dominance and the γ-ray properties are similar to those estimated for other SSRQ and BLRG detected in γ-rays, suggesting an intermediate viewing angle with respect to the observer. In this context the flaring activity detected from this source by Fermi-Large Area Telescope between 2010 June and 2012 February is very intriguing. We discuss the γ-ray emission of this source in the framework of the structured jet scenario, comparing the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the flaring state in 2010 June with that of a low state. We present three alternative models corresponding to three different choices of the viewing angles θv = 6°, 15°, and 20°. We obtain a good fit for the first two cases, but the SED obtained with θv = 15° if observed at a small angle does not resemble that of a typical blazar since the synchrotron emission should dominate by a large factor (∼100) the inverse Compton component. This suggests that a viewing angle between 6° and 15° is preferred, with the rapid variability observed during γ-ray flares favouring a smaller angle. However, we cannot rule out that PKS 0521−36 is the misaligned counterpart of a synchrotron-dominated blazar.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208657","galaxies: active;galaxies: individual: PKS 0521−36;galaxies: nuclei;quasars: general;gamma-rays: galaxies;gamma-rays: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Calcium-rich gap transients: tidal detonations of white dwarfs?","P. H. Sell; T. J. Maccarone; R. Kotak; C. Knigge; D. J. Sand",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","4","4198","4206","We hypothesize that at least some of the recently discovered class of calcium-rich gap transients are tidal detonation events of white dwarfs (WDs) by black holes (BHs) or possibly neutron stars. We show that the properties of the calcium-rich gap transients agree well with the predictions of the tidal detonation model. Under the predictions of this model, we use a follow-up X-ray observation of one of these transients, SN 2012hn, to place weak upper limits on the detonator mass of this system that include all intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). As these transients are preferentially in the stellar haloes of galaxies, we discuss the possibility that these transients are tidal detonations of WDs caused by random flyby encounters with IMBHs in dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. This possibility has been already suggested in the literature but without connection to the calcium-rich gap transients. In order for the random flyby cross-section to be high enough, these events would have to be occurring inside these dense stellar associations. However, there is a lack of evidence for IMBHs in these systems, and recent observations have ruled out all but the very faintest dwarf galaxies and globular clusters for a few of these transients. Another possibility is that these are tidal detonations caused by three-body interactions, where a WD is perturbed towards the detonator in isolated multiple star systems. We highlight a number of ways this could occur, even in lower mass systems with stellar-mass BHs or neutron stars. Finally, we outline several new observational tests of this scenario, which are feasible with current instrumentation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208652","accretion, accretion discs;binaries: close;white dwarfs;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: star clusters: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

There are leading candidates for what the dark matter could be (e.g. weakly interacting massive particles, or axions), but no compelling observational or experimental evidence exists to support these particular candidates, nor any beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that might produce such candidates. This suggests that other dark matter candidates, including ones that might arise in the Standard Model, should receive increased attention. Here we consider a general class of dark matter candidates with characteristic masses and interaction cross-sections characterized in units of grams and cm2, respectively – we therefore dub these macroscopic objects as Macros. Such dark matter candidates could potentially be assembled out of Standard Model particles (quarks and leptons) in the early Universe. A combination of Earth-based, astrophysical, and cosmological observations constrain a portion of the Macro parameter space. A large region of parameter space remains, most notably for nuclear-dense objects with masses in the range 55–1017 g and 2 × 1020–4 × 1024 g, although the lower mass window is closed for Macros that destabilize ordinary matter.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208595","dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The statistical analysis of a sample of 735 stars based on seven chemical abundances with the method of Maximum Parsimony (cladistics) yields the most promising results: seven groups are found, distributed along three branches with distinct chemical, spatial and kinematical properties. A progressive chemical evolution can be traced from one group to the next, but also within groups, suggestive of an inhomogeneous chemical enrichment of the initial interstellar matter. The adjustment of stellar evolution models shows that the groups with metallicities [Fe/H] > −1.5 are Helium enriched, thus presumably of second generation. The spatial concentration of the groups increases with chemical evolution, except for two groups, which stand out in their other properties as well. The amplitude of rotation decreases with chemical evolution, except for two of the three metal-rich groups, which rotate fastest, as predicted by recent hydrodynamical simulations. The properties of the groups are interpreted in terms of star formation in gas clouds of different origins. In conclusion, our multivariate analysis has shown that metallicity alone cannot segregate the different populations of ω Centauri.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208599","methods: statistical;stars: AGB and post-AGB;stars: evolution;globular clusters: individual: ω Centauri (NGC 5139)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The latter is customarily defined specifying the functions ϵ(θ) (the energy emitted per jet unit solid angle) and Γ(θ) (the Lorentz factor of the emitting material); the apparent structure is instead defined by us as the isotropic equivalent energy Eiso(θv) as a function of the viewing angle θv. We show how to predict the apparent structure of a jet given its intrinsic structure. We find that a Gaussian intrinsic structure yields a power-law apparent structure: this opens a new viewpoint on the Gaussian (which can be understood as a proxy for a realistic narrow, well-collimated jet structure) as a possible candidate for a quasi-universal GRB jet structure. We show that such a model (a) is consistent with recent constraints on the observed luminosity function of GRBs; (b) implies fewer orphan afterglows with respect to the standard uniform model; (c) can break out the progenitor star (in the collapsar scenario) without wasting an unreasonable amount of energy; (d) is compatible with the explanation of the Amati correlation as a viewing angle effect; (e) can be very standard in energy content, and still yield a very wide range of observed isotropic equivalent energies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208593","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;relativistic processes;gamma-ray burst: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We utilize point spread function photometry to optimally photometer sources in the crowded regions of the galaxy, and benefit from GALEX's increased sensitivity compared to UIT. We match our detections with data from the Local Group Galaxies Survey to create a catalogue with photometry spanning from the far-UV through the optical for a final list of 24 738 sources.

We also present an additional 3000 sources that have no matching optical counterpart. We compare all of our sources to a catalogue of known WR stars in M33 and find that we recover 114 of 206 stars with spatially-coincident UV point sources.

KAT-7 is a pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array precursor MeerKAT, under construction. The short baselines and low system temperature of the telescope make it very sensitive to large-scale, low-surface-brightness emission. The KAT-7 observations detected 33 per cent more flux than previous Very Large Array observations, mainly in the outer parts and in the halo for a total H I mass of 2.1 ± 0.1 × 109 M⊙. H I can be found at large distances perpendicular to the plane out to projected distances of ∼9–10 kpc away from the nucleus and ∼13–14 kpc at the edge of the disc. A novel technique, based on interactive profile fitting, was used to separate the main disc gas from the anomalous (halo) gas. The rotation curve (RC) derived for the H I disc confirms that it is declining in the outer parts, as seen in previous optical Fabry–Perot measurements. As for the anomalous component, its RC has a very shallow gradient in the inner parts and turns over at the same radius as the disc, kinematically lagging by 100 km s−1. The kinematics of the observed extra-planar gas is compatible with an outflow due to the central starburst and galactic fountains in the outer parts. However, the gas kinematics shows no evidence for inflow. Analysis of the near-IR WISE data, shows clearly that the star formation rate is compatible with the starburst nature of NGC 253.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208631","techniques: interferometric;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: individual: NGC 253;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: starburst","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The large mass ratio between the innermost planet and the others means that these excitations can be of substantial amplitude and can have dramatic consequences for the system organization. Such evolution can potentially explain the large observed mutual inclination between the innermost and outermost planets in the system, and implies that tidal heating could have substantially modified the structure of planet e, and possibly reduced its mass by Roche lobe overflow. Similar inner secular resonances may be found in many multiple planet systems and suggest that many of the innermost planets in these systems could have suffered similar evolutions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208660","planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;planet–star interactions","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The sample includes 11 previously known clusters and we report the discovery of seven ECs on WISE images, thus complementing our recent list of 437 new clusters. The main goal is to use such clusters to shed new light on the Galactic structure by tracing the spiral arms with cluster distances. Our results favour a four-armed spiral pattern tracing three arms, Sagitarius–Carina, Perseus, and the Outer arm. The Sagitarius–Carina spiral arm is probed in the borderline of the third and fourth quadrants at a distance from the Galactic Centre of d1 ∼ 6.4 kpc adopting R⊙ = 7.2 kpc, or d2 ∼ 7.2 kpc for R⊙ = 8.0 kpc.

Dolidze 25, Bochum 2, and Camargo 445 are located in the Outer arm that extends along the second and third Galactic quadrants with a distance from the Galactic Centre in the range of d1 = 12.5–14.5 kpc or d2 = 13.5–15.5 kpc. We find further evidence that in the Galaxy ECs are predominantly located within the thin disc and along spiral arms.

We found a slope of 1.4–1.9, in agreement with self-similar predictions, with an intrinsic scatter of 20 ± 10 per cent. The absolute calibration of the relation cannot be ascertained due to systematic differences of ∼20–40 per cent in mass estimates reported by distinct groups. Due to the scatter, the slope of the conditional scaling relation, to be used in cosmological studies of number counts, is shallower, ∼1.1–1.6. The regression methods employed account for intrinsic scatter in the mass measurements too.

We analyse archival Hubble Space Telescope images of two nearby ‘compact’ irregular galaxies (NGC 4190 and NGC 5204), which were selected solely on the basis of their dynamical properties and their proximity. We derive their recent star formation histories by fitting colour–magnitude diagrams of resolved stellar populations, and find that the star formation properties of both galaxies are consistent with those of known starburst dwarfs.

Here we present long-slit spectroscopy revealing that such regions do have line emission, but that it is low-level, spatially smooth and almost ubiquitous. The relative strengths of the H α and the spectrally adjacent [N II] lines in the regions are completely discrepant from those associated with star formation regions, and more closely match expectations for ‘LINER’ regions. We quantify the total line emission from these extended, kpc-scale regions, and determine the spurious contribution it would make to the determined star formation rate of these galaxies if interpreted as normal H α emission.

We compute a grid of evolutionary sequences from the main sequence to ∼3000 K on the white dwarf cooling curve, passing through all intermediate stages. During the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch no third dredge-up episodes are considered and thus the photospheric C/O ratio is below unity for sequences with metallicities larger than Z = 0.0001. We consider initial metallicities from Z = 0.0001 to 0.04, accounting for stellar populations in the galactic disc and halo, with initial masses below ∼3 M⊙. We found a clear dependence of the shape of the initial-to-final mass relation with the progenitor metallicity, where metal-rich progenitors result in less massive white dwarf remnants, due to an enhancement of the mass-loss rates associated with high metallicity values. By comparing our theoretical computations with semi-empirical data from globular and old open clusters, we found that the observed intrinsic mass spread can be accounted for by a set of initial-to-final mass relations characterized by different metallicity values. Also, we confirm that the lifetime spent before the white dwarf stage increases with metallicity. Finally, we estimate the mean mass at the top of the white dwarf cooling curve for three globular clusters NGC 6397, M4 and 47 Tuc, around 0.53 M⊙, characteristic of old stellar populations. However, we found different values for the progenitor mass, lower for the metal-poor cluster, NGC 6397, and larger for the younger and metal-rich cluster 47 Tuc, as expected from the metallicity dependence of the initial-to-final mass relation","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208626","stars: evolution;stars: interiors;white dwarfs","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The most simple explanation is that these stellar systems harbour multiple generations of stars with an age difference of a few hundred million years. However, while an eMSTO has been detected in a large number of clusters with ages between ∼1–2 Gyr, several studies of young clusters in both MCs and in nearby galaxies do not find any evidence for a prolonged star formation history, i. e. for multiple stellar generations. These results have suggested alternative interpretation of the eMSTOs observed in intermediate-age star clusters. The eMSTO could be due to stellar rotation mimicking an age spread or to interacting binaries. In these scenarios, intermediate-age MC clusters would be simple stellar populations, in close analogy with younger clusters. Here, we provide the first evidence for an eMSTO in a young stellar cluster. We exploit multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometry to study the ∼300-Myr old star cluster NGC 1856 in the Large Magellanic Cloud and detected a broadened MSTO that is consistent with a prolonged star formation which had a duration of about 150 Myr. Below the turn-off, the main sequence (MS) of NGC 1856 is split into a red and blue component, hosting 33 ± 5 and 67 ± 5 per cent of the total number of MS stars, respectively. We discuss these findings in the context of multiple-stellar-generation, stellar-rotation, and interacting-binary hypotheses.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208614","stars: Population II;stars: rotation;globular clusters: general;globular clusters: individual: NGC1856;Magellanic Clouds","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These methods recover the mass at a specific radius where the mass estimate is expected to be least sensitive to the anisotropy of stellar orbits. One uses the total luminosity-weighted velocity dispersion and evaluates the mass at a 3D half-light radius r1/2, i.e. it depends on the global galaxy properties. Another approach estimates the mass from the velocity dispersion at a radius R2 where the surface brightness declines as R−2, i.e. it depends on the local properties. We evaluate the accuracy of the two methods for analytical models, simulated galaxies and real elliptical galaxies that have already been modelled by the Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition technique. Both estimators recover an almost unbiased circular speed estimate with a modest rms scatter (≲10 per cent). Tests on analytical models and simulated galaxies indicate that the local estimator has a smaller rms scatter than the global one. We show by examination of simulated galaxies that the projected velocity dispersion at R2 could serve as a good proxy for the virial galaxy mass. For simulated galaxies the total halo mass scales with σp(R2) as $ M_{\rm vir} [\mathrm{M}_{{\odot }}\,h^{-1}] \approx 6\times 10^{12}({{\sigma _{\rm p}(R_2)}\over{200\, \rm km\, s^{-1}}})^{4}$ with rms scatter ≈40 per cent.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208616","galaxies: Kinematics and Dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Perren",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","4","3771","3777","The age calibration of the Washington δT1 index is mainly used to estimate ages of star clusters older than 1 Gyr and no age–metallicity degeneracy effect is considered. We have profusely exploited synthetic T1 versus C − T1 colour magnitude diagrams to explore the intrinsic behaviour of the δT1 index. The analysis shows that δT1 varies with age and metal content as well. In general, the dependence on age weakens for ages greater than ∼6 Gyr, and is even less sensitive to age as the metallicity decreases. For ages younger than ∼5 Gyr, δT1 shows a strong correlation with both age and metallicity. The δC index – defined as δT1 for the C passband – is also a combined measurement of age and metallicity. We introduce a new age–metallicity diagnostic diagram, δT1 versus δC − δT1, which can unambiguously provide age and metallicity estimates, simultaneously. The new procedure can be used to derive ages from 1 up to 13 Gyr and metallicities [Fe/H] from −2.0 up to +0.5 dex, and is independent of the cluster reddening and distance modulus. It solves the constraints found in the δT1 index and surpasses the performance of the standard giant branch metallicity method. All these features make the diagnostic diagram a powerful tool for estimating accurate ages as well as metallicities.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208633","techniques: photometric","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The 13CO in six ETGs is sufficiently bright to create images. In these six sources, we do not detect any significant radial gradient in the 13CO/12CO ratio between the nucleus and the outlying molecular gas. Using the 12CO channel maps as 3D masks to stack the 13CO emission, we are able to detect 15/17 galaxies to >3σ (and 12/17 to at least 5σ) significance in a spatially integrated manner. Overall, ETGs show a wide distribution of 13CO/12CO ratios, but Virgo cluster and group galaxies preferentially show a 13CO/12CO ratio about two times larger than field galaxies, although this could also be due to a mass dependence, or the CO spatial extent (RCO/Re). ETGs whose gas has a morphologically settled appearance also show boosted 13CO/12CO ratios. We hypothesize that this variation could be caused by (i) the extra enrichment of gas from molecular reprocessing occurring in low-mass stars (boosting the abundance of 13C to 12C in the absence of external gas accretion), (ii) much higher pressure being exerted on the mid-plane gas (by the intracluster medium) in the cluster environment than in isolated galaxies, or (iii) all but the densest molecular gas clumps being stripped as the galaxies fall into the cluster. Further observations of 13CO in dense environments, particularly of spirals, as well as studies of other isotopologues, should be able to distinguish between these hypotheses.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208617","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Frequency modulation caused by binary orbital motion manifests itself as a multiplet with equal spacing of the orbital frequency in the Fourier transform. The amplitudes and phases of the peaks in these multiplets reflect the orbital properties, hence the orbital parameters can be extracted by analysing such precise photometric data alone. We derive analytically the theoretical relations between the multiplet properties and the orbital parameters, and present a method for determining these parameters, including the eccentricity and the argument of periapsis, from a quintuplet or a higher order multiplet. This is achievable with the photometry alone, without spectroscopic radial velocity measurements. We apply this method to Kepler mission data of KIC 8264492, KIC 9651065, and KIC 10990452, each of which is shown to have an eccentricity exceeding 0.5.

The amplitude of gas density fluctuations on different scales is measured in a set of radial annuli. It varies from 7 to 12 per cent on scales of ∼10–30 kpc within radii of 30–220 kpc from the cluster centre. Using a statistical linear relation between the observed amplitude of density fluctuations and predicted velocity, the characteristic velocity of gas motions on each scale is calculated. The typical amplitudes of the velocity outside the central 30 kpc region are 90–140 km s−1 on ∼20–30 kpc scales and 70–100 km s−1 on smaller scales ∼7–10 kpc. The velocity power spectrum (PS) is consistent with cascade of turbulence and its slope is in a broad agreement with the slope for canonical Kolmogorov turbulence. The gas clumping factor estimated from the PS of the density fluctuations is lower than 7–8 per cent for radii ∼30–220 kpc from the centre, leading to a density bias of less than 3–4 per cent in the cluster core. Uncertainties of the analysis are examined and discussed. Future measurements of the gas velocities with the Astro-H, Athena and Smart-X observatories will directly measure the gas density–velocity perturbation relation and further reduce systematic uncertainties in this analysis.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208651","turbulence;methods: observational;methods: statistical;techniques: image processing;galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium;X-rays: galaxies: clusters","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We match and combine these surveys to investigate a wide area in latitude and longitude, |b| ≤ 9° and |l| ≤ 40°.

One of the peculiarities of this source is the presence of regular outbursts with a recurrence period between 600 and 730 d that has been observed since the discovery of the source in 1969. We report on a comparative study of the spectral and timing behaviour of three consecutive outbursts that occurred in 2006, 2008 and 2010. We have analysed all the data collected by INTEGRAL and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) during these three years of activity. We show that, in spite of having a similar spectral and timing behaviour in the energy range between 3 and 30 keV, these three outbursts show pronounced differences above 30 keV. In fact, the 2010 outburst extends at high energies without any detectable cut-off until 150–200 keV, while the two previous outbursts that occurred in 2006 and 2008 are not detected at all above 30 keV. Thus, in spite of a very similar accretion disc evolution, these three outbursts exhibit totally different characteristics of the Compton electron corona, showing a softening in their evolution rarely observed before in a low-mass X-ray binary hosting a black hole. We argue the possibility that the unknown perturbation that causes the outbursts to be equally spaced in time could be at the origin of this particular behaviour. Finally, we describe several possible scenarios that could explain the regularity of the outbursts, identifying the most plausible, such as a third body orbiting around the binary system.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208585","black hole physics;methods: data analysis;binaries: close;stars: black holes;X-rays: binaries;X-rays: individual: 4U1630-472","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These sources can be uniform or 2D Gaussians on the sky with transverse linear gradients in rotation measure (RM), or cylinders or spheroids with an azimuthal magnetic field. At high frequencies, the spectra of all these models can be approximated by the spectrum of a Gaussian source; this is independent of whether the magnetic field is large scale or small scale. A sinc spectrum in polarized flux density is not a unique signature of a volume where synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. A turbulent Faraday screen with a large field coherence length produces a spectrum which is similar to the spectrum of a partial coverage model. At low and intermediate frequencies, such a Faraday screen produces a significantly higher polarized signal than Burn's depolarization model, as shown by a random walk model of the polarization vectors. We calculate RM spectra for four frequency windows. Sources are strongly depolarized at low frequencies, but RMs can be determined accurately if the sensitivity of the observations is sufficient. Finally, we show that RM spectra can be used to differentiate between turbulent foreground models and partial coverage models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208588","magnetic fields;polarization;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: jets;galaxies: magnetic fields","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

And yet, they are observed to live about 10–100 times longer, i.e. the SFR per freefall time (SFRff) is only a few per cent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must counteract the quick global collapse. Turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback have been proposed as regulating agents, but it is still unclear which of these processes is the most important and what their relative contributions are. Here, we run high-resolution simulations including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields and jet/outflow feedback. We confirm that clouds collapse on a mean freefall time, if only gravity is considered, producing stars at an unrealistic rate. In contrast, if turbulence, magnetic fields and feedback are included step-by-step, the SFR is reduced by a factor of 2–3 with each additional physical ingredient. When they all act in concert, we find a constant SFRff = 0.04, currently the closest match to observations, but still about a factor of 2–4 higher than the average. A detailed comparison with other simulations and with observations leads us to conclude that only models with turbulence producing large virial parameters, and including magnetic fields and feedback can produce realistic SFRs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208667","MHD;turbulence;stars: formation;ISM: clouds;ISM: jets and outflows;ISM: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the use of the radio lobe luminosity in the denominator (essentially to try and factor out the intrinsic power of the central engine) has been criticized and other proxies for the intrinsic engine power have been proposed. These include the optical continuum luminosity, and the luminosity of the narrow-line region. Each is plausible, but so far none has been shown to be clearly better than the others. In this paper, we evaluate four different measures of core dominance using a new sample of 126 radio-loud quasars, carefully selected to be as free as possible of orientation bias, together with high-quality Very Large Array images and optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that normalizing the radio core luminosity by the optical continuum luminosity yields a demonstrably superior orientation indicator. In addition, by comparing the equivalent widths of broad emission lines in our orientation-unbiased sample to those of sources in the MOJAVE programme, we show that the beamed optical synchrotron emission from the jets is not a significant component of the optical continuum for the sources in our sample. We also discuss future applications of these results.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208658","quasars: emission lines;quasars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The relative spatial distribution of the H I and CO components is consistent with a photodissociation region. We have identified and characterized four main and distinct molecular clouds that create this structure. Cold dust is coincident with the dense gas shown in the CO measurements. We have found several young stellar object candidates that lie along the regions with the highest gas column density, and suggest that they are spatially correlated with the shell.

Estimates of the steady-state strength of the large-scale and turbulent magnetic fields from mean-field and fluctuation dynamo models are used together with galaxy properties predicted by semi-analytic models of galaxy formation for a population of spiral galaxies. We find that the field strength is mostly controlled by the evolving gas content of the galaxies. Thus, because of the differences in the implementation of the star formation law, feedback from supernovae and ram-pressure stripping, each of the galaxy formation models considered predicts a distribution of field strengths with unique features.

After controlling for the known dependences of $\dot{M}_*$ and Md on age, $\dot{M}_*$ on stellar mass and Md on the presence of stellar or substellar companions, we find that the normal T Tauri stars show a trend of $\dot{M}_*$ increasing with Md. The transition discs tend to have higher average disc masses than normal T Tauri stars as well as lower accretion rates than normal T Tauri stars of the same disc mass. These results are most consistent with the interpretation that the transition discs have formed objects massive enough to alter the accretion flow, i.e. single or multiple giant planets. Several Ophiuchus T Tauri stars that are not known transition disc systems also have very low accretion rates for their disc masses. We speculate on the possible nature of these sources.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208618","planets and satellites: formation;protoplanetary discs;circumstellar matter;stars: formation;stars: pre-main-sequence","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use a sample of hot Jupiter hosting stars, focusing on the HD 179949, HD 189733 and τ Boo systems. Our results indicate two time-scales over which radio emission variability may occur at magnetized hot Jupiters. The first is the synodic period of the star–planet system. The origin of variability on this time-scale is the relative motion between the planet and the interplanetary plasma that is corotating with the host star. The second time-scale is the length of the magnetic cycle. Variability on this time-scale is caused by evolution of the stellar field. At these systems, the magnitude of planetary radio emission is anticorrelated with the angular separation between the subplanetary point and the nearest magnetic pole. For the special case of τ Boo b, whose orbital period is tidally locked to the rotation period of its host star, variability only occurs on the time-scale of the magnetic cycle. The lack of radio variability on the synodic period at τ Boo b is not predicted by previous radio emission models, which do not account for the co-rotation of the interplanetary plasma at small distances from the star.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208649","planet–star interactions;planetary systems;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Compared with NFBs, FBs have larger mean jet power, Rc and Rv, while having smaller mean redshift, black hole mass and broad-line luminosity. These results support the fact that the beaming effect is the main reason for differences between FBs and NFBs, and that FBs are likely to have a more powerful jet. For both FBs and NFBs, there are significant correlations between the jet power and the accretion rate (traced by the broad-emission line luminosity), and between the jet power and the black hole mass. For FBs, the black hole mass does not have a significant influence on jet power, while for NFBs, both the accretion rate and black hole mass contribute to the jet power.

The e-folding times change around the time of the state transition, from typically ≈12 d at the end of the soft state to ≈7 d at the beginning of the hard state. This factor ∼2 change in the decay time-scale is expected if there is a change from radiatively efficient emission in the soft state to radiatively inefficient emission in the hard state, overlying an exponential decay in the mass accretion rate.

When taking into account the limits of both the N-body and the Vlasov codes, namely collective effects due to the particle shot noise in the first case and diffusion and possible non-linear instabilities due to finite resolution of the phase-space grid in the second case, we find a spectacular agreement between both methods, even in regions of phase-space where non-trivial physical instabilities develop.

The sound speed is a better albeit not always correct description of the cold flows’ velocity. Using these calculations as a first order approximation for the gas inflow velocities vinflow = 0.9 vvir is given.

One of the techniques consists in rebuilding their shape in tetrahedral polyhedron. This method is well suited to determine the shape and estimate certain physical features of asteroids. However, a large computational effort is necessary depending on the quantity of triangular faces chosen. Another method is based on a representation of the central body in terms of mascons (discrete spherical masses). The main advantage of the method is its simplicity which makes the calculation faster. Nevertheless, the errors are non-negligible when the attraction expressions are calculated near the surface of the body. In this work, we carry out a study to develop a new code that determines the centre of mass of each tetrahedron of a shaped polyhedral source and evaluates the gravitational potential function and its first- and second-order derivatives. We performed a series of tests and compared the results with the classical polyhedron method. We found good agreement between our determination of the attraction expressions close to the surface, and the same determination by the classical polyhedron method. However, this agreement does not occur inside the body. Our model appears to be more accurate in representing the potential very close to the body's surface when we divide the tetrahedron in three parts. Finally, we have found that in terms of CPU time requirements, the execution of our code is much faster compared with the polyhedron method.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208623","gravitation;methods: numerical;celestial mechanics;minor planets, asteroids: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Absorption features from the mass donor star were not detected. Instead the spectra display prominent broad double-peaked H α emission and weaker He I emission lines. From the H α peak-to-peak separation, we constrain the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star to K2 > 789 km s−1. Further analysis through radial velocity and equivalent width measurements indicates that the H α line is free of variability due to S-wave components or disc eclipses. From our data and previous observations during outburst, we conclude that long-term radial velocity changes ascribed to a precessing disc were of low amplitude or not present. This implies that the centroid position of the line should closely represent the systemic radial velocity, γ. Using the derived γ = −150 km s−1 and the best available limits on the source distance, we infer that the black hole is moving towards the plane in its current Galactic orbit unless the proper motion is substantial. Finally, the depth of the central absorption in the double-peaked profiles adds support for Swift J1357.2−0933 as a high-inclination system.

We show that the CIB-lensing bispectrum has a considerable strength and that it can be detected with high significance in the Planck high-frequency maps. We also present forecasts of the contamination on different shapes of the primordial non-Gaussianity fnl parameter produced by the CIB-lensing bispectrum and by the extragalactic point sources bispectrum in the Planck high-resolution CMB anisotropy maps. The local, equilateral and orthogonal shapes are considered for ‘raw’ single-frequency (i.e. without applying any component separation technique) and foreground-reduced Planck temperature maps. The CIB-lensing correlation seems to mainly affect orthogonal shapes of the bispectrum – with $\Delta f_{\rm nl}^{\rm (ort)} =-21$ and −88 for the 143 and 217 GHz bands, respectively – while point sources mostly impact equilateral shapes, with $\Delta f_{\rm nl}^{\rm (eq)} =160, 54$ and 60 at 100, 143 and 217 GHz. However, the results indicate that these contaminants do not induce any relevant bias on Planck fnl estimates when foreground-reduced maps are considered: using SEVEM for the component separation, we obtain $\Delta f_{\rm nl}^{\rm (ort)} =10.5$ due to the CIB-lensing and $\Delta f_{\rm nl}^{\rm (eq)}=30.4$ due to point sources, corresponding to 0.3σ and 0.45σ in terms of the Planck 2013 fnl uncertainty. The component separation technique is, in fact, able to partially clean the extragalactic source contamination and the bias is reduced for all the shapes.

Through this we aim to derive insight into where within the AGN the X-ray, γ-ray and VHE emission is produced. We have analysed all available INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI (Imager on Board INTEGRAL Spacecraft/INTEGRAL Soft Gamma-Ray Imager) data on M87, spanning almost 10 years, to set an upper limit to the average hard X-ray flux of f(20-60 keV) ≲ 3 × 10−12  erg cm−2 s−1, using several techniques beyond the standard analysis which are also presented here. We also analysed hard X-ray data from Suzaku/PIN taken late 2006 November, and we report the first hard X-ray detection of M87 with a flux of f(20-60 keV) = 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1. In addition we analyse data from Fermi/Large Area Telescope, INTEGRAL/Joint European Monitor in X-rays, and Suzaku/X-ray Imaging Spectrometer. We collected historical radio/IR/optical and VHE data and combined them with the X-ray and γ-ray data, to create broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the average low-flux state and the flaring state. The resulting SEDs are modelled by applying a single-zone SSC model with a jet angle of θ = 15°. We also show that modelling the core emission of M87 using a single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model does represent the SED, suggesting that the core emission is dominated by a BL Lac-type AGN core. Using SED modelling we also show that the hard X-ray emission detected in 2006 is likely due to a flare of the jet knot HST-1, rather than being related to the core.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208664","galaxies: active;galaxies: individual: M87;gamma rays: galaxies;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Orientation and rotational parameters of asteroid 4179 Toutatis: new insights from Chang′e-2's close flyby","Y. Zhao; J. Ji; J. Huang; S. Hu; X. Hou; Y. Li; W. Ip",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","4","3620","3632","In this paper, we investigate the rotational dynamics of the ginger-shaped near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis, which was closely observed by Chang′e-2 at a distance of 770 ± 120 m from the asteroid's surface during the outbound flyby on 2012 December 13. A sequence of high-resolution images was acquired during the flyby mission. In combination with ground-based radar observations collected over the last two decades, we analyse these flyby images and determine the orientation of the asteroid at the flyby epoch. The 3–1–3 Euler angles of the conversion matrix from the J2000 ecliptic coordinate system to the body-fixed frame are evaluated to be −20 $_{.}^{\circ}$1 ± 1°, 27 $_{.}^{\circ}$6 ± 1° and 42 $_{.}^{\circ}$2 ± 1°, respectively. The least-squares method is utilized to determine the rotational parameters and spin state of Toutatis. The characteristics of the spin-state parameters and angular momentum variations are extensively studied using numerical simulations, which confirm those reported by Takahashi, Busch & Scheeres (2013, AJ, 146, 95). The large amplitude of the precession of Toutatis is assumed to be responsible for its tumbling attitude as observed from Earth. The angular momentum orientation of Toutatis is determined to be described by $\lambda _{\rm H} = 180 {^{\circ}_{.}} 2^{+0{^{\circ}_{.}} 2}_{-0{^{\circ}_{.}} 3}$ and $\beta _{\rm H} = -54{^{\circ}_{.}} 75^{+0{^{\circ}_{.}} 15}_{-0{^{\circ}_{.}} 10}$, implying that it has remained nearly unchanged for two decades. Furthermore, using Fourier analysis to explore the change in the orientation of the axes of Toutatis, we reveal that the two rotational periods are 5.38 and 7.40 d, respectively, consistent with the results of the earlier investigation. Hence, our investigation provides a clear understanding of the state of the rotational dynamics of Toutatis.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208600","minor planets, asteroids: individual: Toutatis;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;planets and satellites: interiors","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here, we investigate the feasibility of such an experiment for z > 5 galaxies. We construct the $L_{\rm C\,\small {II}} {\rm -} M_{\rm h}$ relation from observations and simulations, then generate mock [C II] intensity maps by applying this relation to halo catalogues built from large scale N-body simulations. Maps of the extragalactic far-infrared (FIR) continuum, referred to as ‘foreground’, and CO rotational transition lines and [C I] fine-structure lines referred to as ‘contamination’, are produced as well. We find that, at 316 GHz (corresponding to $z_{\rm C\,\small {II}} = 5$), the mean intensities of the extragalactic FIR continuum, [C II] signal, all CO lines from J = 1 to 13 and two [C I] lines are ∼3 × 105, ∼1200, ∼800, and ∼100 Jy sr−1, respectively. We discuss a method that allows us to subtract the FIR continuum foreground by removing a spectrally smooth component from each line of sight, and to suppress the CO/[C I] contamination by discarding pixels that are bright in contamination emission. The z > 5 [C II] signal comes mainly from haloes in the mass range 1011–12 M⊙; as this mass range is narrow, intensity mapping is an ideal experiment to investigate these early galaxies. In principle such signal is accessible to a ground-based telescope with a 6 m aperture, 150-K system temperature, a 128 × 128 pixels FIR camera in 5000-h total integration time; however, it is difficult to perform such an experiment by using currently available telescopes.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208666","galaxies: high-redshift;dark ages, reionization, first stars;diffuse radiation;radio lines: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The close agreement that we find between the two sets of effective collision strengths demonstrates the continued robustness of the ICFT method. On the other hand, a comparison of this data with previous 238-level CI/CC ICFT effective collision strengths shows that the results for excitation up to n = 4 levels are systematically and increasingly underestimated over a wide range of temperatures by R-matrix calculations whose CC expansion extends only to n = 4 (98-levels). Thus, we find to be false a recent conjecture that the ICFT approach may not be completely robust. The conjecture was based upon a comparison of 98-level CI/CC Dirac R-matrix effective collision strengths for Al 9+ with those from the 238-level CI/CC ICFT R-matrix calculations. The disagreement found recently is due to a lack of convergence of the CC expansion in the 98-level CI/CC Dirac work. The earlier 238-level CI/CC ICFT work has a superior target to the 98-level CI/CC Dirac one and provides more accurate atomic data.

Fujisawa",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","4","4016","4024","We have succeeded in obtaining magnetized equilibrium states with differential rotation and differential toroidal magnetic fields. If an internal toroidal field of a protoneutron star is wound up from the initial poloidal magnetic field by differential rotation, the distribution of the toroidal magnetic field is determined by the profile of this differential rotation. However, the distributions of the toroidal fields in all previous magnetized equilibrium studies do not represent the magnetic winding by the differential rotation of the star. In this paper, we investigate a formulation of a differential toroidal magnetic field that represents the magnetic field wound up by differential rotation. We have developed two functional forms of differential toroidal fields which correspond to a v-constant and a j-constant field in analogy to differential rotations. As the degree of the differential becomes very high, the toroidal magnetic field becomes highly localized and concentrated near the rotational axis. Such a differential toroidal magnetic field would suppress the low-T/|W| instability more efficiently even if the total magnetic field energy is much smaller than that of a non-differential toroidal magnetic field.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208654","stars: magnetic field;stars: neutron;stars: rotation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The suppression of direct collapse black hole formation by soft X-ray irradiation","K. Inayoshi; T. L. Tanaka",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","4","4350","4363","The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei is one of the major unsolved problems in astrophysics. One hypothesis is that they grew from ≳ 105 M⊙ black holes that formed in the ‘direct collapse’ of massive gas clouds that have low concentrations of both metals and molecular hydrogen (H2). Such clouds could form in the early (z ≳ 10) Universe if pre-galactic gas is irradiated by H2-photodissociating, far-ultraviolet (FUV) light from a nearby star-forming galaxy. In this work, we re-examine the critical FUV flux Jcrit that is required to keep H2 photodissociated and lead to direct collapse. We submit that the same galaxies that putatively supply the extraordinary FUV fluxes required for direct collapse should also produce copious amounts of soft X-rays, which work to offset H2 photodissociation by increasing the ionization fraction and promoting H2 formation. Accounting for this effect increases the value of Jcrit by a factor of at least 3–10, depending on the brightness temperature of FUV radiation. This enhancement of Jcrit suppresses the abundance of potential direct collapse sites at z > 10 by several orders of magnitude. Recent studies – without accounting for the soft X-rays from the FUV source galaxies – had already arrived at large values of Jcrit that implied that direct collapse may occur too rarely to account for the observed abundance of high-redshift quasars. Our results suggest that Jcrit should be even higher than previously estimated, and pose an additional challenge for the direct collapse scenario via strong FUV radiation to explain the high-redshift quasar population.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208637","black hole physics;galaxies: formation;quasars: supermassive black holes;cosmology: theory;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We employ three models to study the systematic effects of extinction, the assumed extinction law, and metallicity on the Cepheid distance to NGC 4258. We find a correction to the Cepheid colours consistent with a greyer extinction law in NGC 4258 compared to the Milky Way (RV = $4.9_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$), although we believe this is indicative of other systematic effects. If we combine our Cepheid sample with previously known Cepheids, we find a significant metallicity adjustment to the distance modulus of γ1 = −0.61 ± 0.21 mag dex−1 for the Zaritsky et al. metallicity scale, as well as a weak trend of Cepheid colours with metallicity. Conclusions about the absolute effect of metallicity on Cepheid mean magnitudes are limited by the available data on the metallicity gradient in NGC 4258, but our Cepheid data require at least some metallicity adjustment to make the Cepheid distance consistent with independent distances to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC 4258.

"Supermassive black hole formation at high redshifts via direct collapse in a cosmological context","J. Choi; I. Shlosman; M. C. Begelman",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","4","4411","4423","We study the early stage of the formation of seed supermassive black holes via direct collapse in dark matter (DM) haloes, in the cosmological context. We perform high-resolution zoom-in simulations of such collapse at high z. Using the adaptive mesh refinement code ENZO, we resolve the formation and growth of a DM halo, until its virial temperature reaches ∼104 K, atomic cooling turns on, and collapse ensues. We demonstrate that direct collapse proceeds in two stages, although they are not well separated. The first stage is triggered by the onset of atomic cooling, and leads to rapidly increasing accretion rate with radius, from $\dot{M}\sim 0.1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot }\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ at the halo virial radius to few M⊙ yr−1, around the scale radius Rs ∼ 30 pc of the NFW DM density profile. The second stage of the collapse commences when the gas density takes precedence over the DM density. This is associated with the gas decoupling from the DM gravitational potential. The ensuing collapse approximates that of an isothermal sphere with $\dot{M}{(r)}\sim$ const. We confirm that the gas loses its angular momentum through non-axisymmetric perturbations and gravitational torques, to overcome the centrifugal barrier. During the course of the collapse, this angular momentum transfer process happens on nearly all spatial scales, and the angular momentum vector of the gas varies with position and time. Collapsing gas also exhibits supersonic turbulent motions which suppress gas fragmentation, and are characterized by density PDF consisting of a lognormal part and a high-density power-law tail.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208586","methods: numerical;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;cosmology: theory;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Haloes are selected from the theoretically expected LG mass function and two different density profiles are assumed, a standard universal cuspy model and a mass-dependent profile which accounts for the effects of baryons in modifying the dark matter distribution within galaxies. The resulting relations between stellar and halo mass are compared with expectations from abundance matching. Using a universal cuspy profile, the ensemble of LG galaxies is fit in relatively low-mass haloes, leaving ‘dark’ many massive haloes of Mhalo ≳ 1010 M⊙: this reflects the ‘too-big-to-fail’ problem and results in a Mstar–Mhalo relation that differs from abundance matching predictions. Moreover, the star formation efficiency of isolated LG galaxies increases with decreasing halo mass when adopting a cuspy model. By contrast, using the mass-dependent density profile, dwarf galaxies with Mstar ≳ 106 M⊙ are assigned to more massive haloes, which have a central cored distribution of dark matter: the ‘too-big-to-fail’ problem is alleviated, the resultant Mstar–Mhalo relation follows abundance matching predictions down to the completeness limit of current surveys, and the star formation efficiency of isolated members decreases with decreasing halo mass, in agreement with theoretical expectations. Finally, the cusp/core space of LG galaxies is presented, providing a framework to understand the non-universality of their density profiles.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208635","galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes;Local Group","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We recover four main features in the NICI images of the HD 141569 disc discovered in previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging: (1) an inner ring/spiral feature. Once deprojected, this feature does not appear circular. (2) An outer ring which is considerably brighter on the western side compared to the eastern side, but looks fairly circular in the deprojected image. (3) An additional arc-like feature between the inner and outer ring only evident on the east side. In the deprojected image, this feature appears to complete the circle of the west side inner ring and (4) an evacuated cavity from 175 au inwards. Compared to the previous HST imaging with relatively large coronagraphic inner working angles (IWA), the NICI coronagraph allows imaging down to an IWA of 0.3 arcsec. Thus, the inner edge of the inner ring/spiral feature is well resolved and we do not find any additional disc structures within 175 au. We note some additional asymmetries in this system. Specifically, while the outer ring structure looks circular in this deprojection, the inner bright ring looks rather elliptical. This suggests that a single deprojection angle is not appropriate for this system and that there may be an offset in inclination between the two ring/spiral features. We find an offset of 4 ± 2 au between the inner ring and the star centre, potentially pointing to unseen inner companions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208636","circumstellar matter;infrared: stars","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Observational studies have historically selected samples of galaxies using a physical quantity, such as stellar mass, either above a constant limit or at a constant cumulative number density. Investigation into the efficacy of these selection methods has not been fully explored. Using a set of four semi-analytical models based on the output of the Millennium Simulation, we find that selecting galaxies at a constant number density (in the range −4.3 < log  n [Mpc−3 h3] < −3.0) is superior to a constant stellar mass selected sample, although it still has significant limitations. Recovery of the average stellar mass, stellar mass density and average star formation rate is highly dependent on the choice of number density but can all be recovered to within <50 per cent at the commonly employed choice of log  n [Mpc−3 h3] = −4.0, corresponding to log M⊙ h−1 ∼ 11.2 at z = 0, but this increases at lower mass limits. We show that there is a large scatter between the location of a given galaxy in a rank ordering based on stellar mass between different redshifts. We find that the inferred velocity dispersion may be a better tracer of galaxy properties, although further investigation is warranted into simulating this property. Finally, we find that over large redshift ranges selection at a constant number density is more effective in tracing the progenitors of modern galaxies than vice versa.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208632","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The ACFs are a powerful tool that significantly narrows the 3D parameter space allowed by LAE Lyα and UV luminosity functions (LFs) alone. With this work, we simultaneously constrain the escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc = 0.05–0.5, the mean fraction of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) $\langle \chi _{\rm H\,\small {I}} \rangle$ ≲ 0.01 and the dust-dependent ratio of the escape fractions of Lyα and UV continuum photons fα/fc = 0.6–1.2.

We also show that galaxies with a critical stellar mass of M* = 108.5(109.5) M⊙ produce enough luminosity to stay visible as LBGs (LAEs). Finally, the fraction of time during the past 100 Myr prior to z = 6.6 a galaxy spends as an LBG or as an LBG with Lyα emission increases with the UV magnitude (and the stellar mass M*); considering observed (dust and IGM attenuated) luminosities, the fraction of time a galaxy spends as an LBG (LAE) increases from 65–100 per cent (≃ 0–100 per cent) as MUV decreases from MUV = −18.0 to −23.5 (M* increases from 108–1010.5 M⊙).

We find no optical or infrared counterpart to this event in pre-existing survey data or in an observation taken by the Simultaneous-3color InfraRed Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS) instrument at the Infrared Survey Facility ∼2.1 yr after the transient, providing limiting magnitudes of J > 18.1, H > 17.6 and Ks > 16.3.

In this paper, we describe the design of the survey, the observations and the data analysis techniques developed. We then present early results from two OSIRIS pointings centred on the cores of the A901a and A902 clusters. AGN and star-forming (SF) objects are identified using the $[\mathrm{N}\,\small {II}]\,/\,\mathrm{H}\,\alpha$ versus WH α diagnostic diagram. The AGN hosts are brighter, more massive, and possess earlier type morphologies than SF galaxies. Both populations tend to be located towards the outskirts of the high-density regions we study. The typical H α luminosity of these sources is significantly lower than that of field galaxies at similar redshifts, but greater than that found for A1689, a rich cluster at z ∼ 0.2. The H α luminosities of our objects translate into star formation rates (SFRs) between ∼0.02 and 6 M⊙ yr−1. Comparing the relationship between stellar mass and H α-derived SFR with that found in the field indicates a suppression of star formation in the cores of the clusters. These findings agree with previous investigations of this multicluster structure, based on other star formation indicators, and demonstrate the power of tuneable filters for this kind of study.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208596","galaxies: clusters: individual: general;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The acoustic feature in the large-scale correlation function of galaxies imprinted by sound waves in the early Universe has been successfully used as a ‘standard ruler’ to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. The standard ruler can be improved if a process known as density field reconstruction is employed. In this paper, we develop the Zeldovich formalism to compute the correlation function of biased tracers in both real and redshift space using the simplest reconstruction algorithm with a Gaussian kernel and compare to N-body simulations. The model qualitatively describes the effects of reconstruction on the simulations, though its quantitative success depends upon how redshift-space distortions are handled in the reconstruction algorithm.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208621","gravitation;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: statistics;cosmological parameters;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Planetary systems and real planetary nebulae from planet destruction near white dwarfs","E. Bear; N. Soker",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","4","4233","4239","We suggest that tidal destruction of Earth-like and icy planets near a white dwarf (WD) might lead to the formation of one or more low-mass – Earth-like and lighter – planets in tight orbits around the WD. The formation of the new WD planetary system starts with a tidal breakup of the parent planet to planetesimals near the tidal radius of about 1 R⊙. Internal stress forces keep the planetesimal from further tidal breakup when their radius is less than about 100 km. We speculate that the planetesimals then bind together to form new sub-Earth daughter-planets at a few solar radii around the WD. More massive planets that contain hydrogen supply the WD with fresh nuclear fuel to reincarnate its stellar-giant phase. Some of the hydrogen will be inflated in a large envelope. The envelope blows a wind to form a nebula that is later (after the entire envelope is lost) ionized by the hot WD. We term this glowing ionized nebula that originated from a planet a real planetary nebula (RPN). This preliminary study of daughter-planets from a planet and the RPN scenarios are of speculative nature. More detailed studies must follow to establish whether the suggested scenarios can indeed take place.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208662","planetary systems;planets and satellites: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To discuss the ambipolar role in a disc structure, a toroidal magnetic field has been applied. Also, to describe the disc structure, a self-similar assumption in the radial direction has been considered, turning the equations into a set of ordinary differential equations about the θ coordinate, which can be solved with numerical methods. In addition, an α viscosity prescription and advective factor f have been used in the equations. The f factor is the fraction of the dissipated energy that is advected as stored entropy. The present study has shown that although disc parameters behave almost similarly, the presence of ambipolar diffusion makes the disc thinner. It has also been found that the magnetic field does not vanish through the disc surface, and remains almost the same in the inflow/outflow region.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208648","accretion, accretion discs;diffusion","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We focus our analysis on simulations of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). In the first part of the paper, we derive the science requirements on star/galaxy separation, for measurement of the cosmological parameters with the gravitational weak lensing and large-scale structure probes. These requirements are dictated by the need to control both the statistical and systematic errors on the cosmological parameters, and by point spread function calibration. We formulate the requirements in terms of the completeness and purity provided by a given star/galaxy classifier. In order to achieve these requirements at faint magnitudes, we propose a new method for star/galaxy separation in the second part of the paper. We first use principal component analysis to outline the correlations between the objects parameters and extract from it the most relevant information. We then use the reduced set of parameters as input to an Artificial Neural Network. This multiparameter approach improves upon purely morphometric classifiers (such as the classifier implemented in SExtractor), especially at faint magnitudes: it increases the purity by up to 20 per cent for stars and by up to 12 per cent for galaxies, at i-magnitude fainter than 23.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu1410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231477","gravitational lensing: weak;methods: data analysis;surveys;cosmology: observations;dark energy;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We observed four transits, two at continuum wavelengths outside the potassium feature, at 6792 and 8844 Å, and two probing the potassium feature in the line wing at 7582.0 Å and the line core at 7664.9 Å using a 12 Å filter width (R ∼ 650). The planet-to-star radius ratios in the continuum are found to be Rpl/R⋆ = 0.1176 ± 0.0013 at 6792 Å and Rpl/R⋆ = 0.1168 ± 0.0022 at 8844 Å, significantly lower than the two observations in the potassium line: Rpl/R⋆ = 0.1248 ± 0.0014 in the line wing at 7582.0 Å and Rpl/R⋆ = 0.1268 ± 0.0012 in the line core at 7664.9 Å. With a weighted mean of the observations outside the potassium feature Rpl/R⋆ = 0.1174 ± 0.0010, the potassium is detected as an increase in the radius ratio of ΔRpl/R⋆ = 0.0073 ± 0.0017 at 7582.0 Å and ΔRpl/R⋆ = 0.0094 ± 0.0016 at 7664.9 Å (a significance of 4.3σ and 6.1σ, respectively). We hypothesize that the strong detection of potassium is caused by a large scaleheight, which can be explained by a high temperature at the base of the upper atmosphere. A lower mean molecular mass caused by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen by the extreme ultraviolet flux from the host star may also partly explain the amplitude of our detection.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231535","techniques: photometric;stars: individual: HAT-P-1b;planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Considering the radial profiles of the radius and number density of clouds in a spherical broad-line region (BLR), we derive new formulae connecting the jet-emitting position Rjet to the time lag τob between broad-line and jet emission variations, and the BLR radius. Also, formulae are derived for a disc-like BLR and a spherical shell BLR. The model-independent flux randomization/random subset selection method is used to estimate τob. For 3C 120, positive lags of about 0.3 yr are found between the 15 GHz emission and the Hβ, Hγ and He ii λ4686 lines, including broad-line data in a newly published paper, indicating that the line variations lead the 15 GHz ones. Each of the broad-line light curves corresponds to a radio outburst. Rjet = 1.1–1.5 parsec (pc) is obtained for 3C 120. For 3C 273, a common feature of negative time lags is found in the cross-correlation functions between light curves of radio emission and the Balmer lines, as well as Lyα λ1216 and C iv λ1549 lines. Rjet = 1.0–2.6 pc is obtained for 3C 273. The estimated Rjet is comparable for 3C 120 and 3C 273, and the gamma-ray-emitting positions will be within ∼1–3 pc from the central engines. Comparisons show that the cloud number density and radius radial distributions and the BLR structures have only negligible effects on Rjet.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231515","galaxies: active;galaxies: individual: 3C 120;galaxies: individual: 3C 273;galaxies: jets;quasars: emission lines;radio continuum: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Two separate monitoring campaigns were carried out using the Very Large Array (VLA) and upgraded VLA.

While it was not possible to measure time delays from these data, χ2-based and structure function tests found evidence for variability in a majority of the light curves. B0712 and B1030 had particularly strong variations, exhibiting linear flux trends. These results suggest that most of these systems should be targeted with follow-up monitoring campaigns, especially B0712 and B1030.

Such modelling needs the spatial distribution of density, chemical abundances, and temperature, that can be provided by chemodynamical simulations (ChDS) of dwarf galaxies. We perform multicomponent photoionization modelling of the ionized gas using 2D ChDSs of dwarf galaxies. We calculate emissivity maps for important nebular emission lines. Their intensities are used to derive the chemical abundance of oxygen by the so-called Te- and R23-methods. Some disagreements are found between oxygen abundances calculated with these methods and the ones coming from the ChDSs. We investigate the fraction of ionizing radiation emitted in the star-forming region which is able to leak out the galaxy. The time- and direction-averaged escape fraction in our simulation is 0.35–0.4. Finally, we have calculated the total Hαluminosity of our model galaxy using Kennicutt's calibration to derive the star formation rate. This value has been compared to the ‘true’ rate in the ChDSs. The Hα-based star formation rate agrees with the true one only at the beginning of the simulation. Minor deviations arise later on and are due in part to the production of high-energy photons in the warm–hot gas, in part to the leakage of energetic photons out of the galaxy. The effect of artificially introduced thin dense shells (with thicknesses smaller than the ChDSs spatial resolution) is investigated, as well.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231503","radiative transfer;H ii regions;galaxies: abundances;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Various non-gravitational effects, the action of the solar electromagnetic radiation in the form of the Poynting–Robertson (PR) effect, the action of the solar wind and the interstellar gas flow are considered. The most relevant is the action of the non-radial solar wind. The non-radial component of the wind causes spiralling of dust particles from the Sun, while the other non-gravitational effects cause spiralling towards the Sun. The effect of the interstellar gas flow is of comparable importance to the PR effect. The effect of the radial solar wind with the κ-distribution is of comparable importance to the simultaneous action of the interstellar gas flow and the PR effect, if the long-term evolution of dust grains in the E–K belt zone is studied without the action of the planet Neptune. The gravity of Neptune stabilizes the dust grains in the belt when the radial solar wind is in action. Grains larger than about 40 μm can be captured into mean-motion orbital resonances with Neptune. If the non-radial solar wind plays a role, then no capture in the mean-motion orbital resonances exists and the gravity of Neptune decreases the mean lifetime of interplanetary dust particles in the E–K belt zone to 60–80 per cent in comparison with the action of the non-gravitational non-collisional effects alone. The simultaneous action of the above discussed non-gravitational effects plays a dominant role among non-gravitational effects. The action of collisions is less important at least for dust grains under the size of 40 μm.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231508","celestial mechanics;interplanetary medium;meteorites, meteors, meteoroids","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Kim",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","1","807","814","We propose a method using the redshift dependence of the Alcock–Paczynski (AP) test and volume effect to measure the cosmic expansion history. The galaxy two-point correlation function as a function of angle, ξ(μ), is measured at different redshifts. Assuming an incorrect cosmological model to convert galaxy redshifts to distances, the shape of ξ(μ) appears anisotropic due to the AP effect, and the amplitude is shifted by the change in comoving volume. Due to the redshift dependence of the AP and volume effect, both the shape and amplitude of ξ(μ) exhibit redshift dependence. Similar to Li et al. (2014), we find that the redshift-space distortions (RSD) caused by galaxy peculiar velocities, although significantly distorting ξ(μ), exhibit much less redshift evolution compared to the AP and volume effects. By focusing on the redshift dependence of ξ(μ), we can correctly recover the cosmological parameters despite the contamination of RSD. The method is tested by using the Horizon Run 3 N-body simulation, from which we made a series of 1/8-sky mock surveys having eight million physically self-bound haloes and sampled to have roughly a uniform number density in z = 0–1.5. We find the AP effect results in tight, unbiased constraints on the density parameter and dark energy equation of state, with 68.3% CL intervals δΩm ∼ 0.03 and δw ∼ 0.1, and the volume effect leads to much tighter constraints of δΩm ∼ 0.007 and δw ∼ 0.035.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231523","cosmological parameters;dark energy;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This particularly applies to the fundamental pinch and kink modes – they become completely suppressed in a wide range of long wavelengths that are known to become most pernicious to jet stability when the evolution enters the non-linear regime.

"Multipolar electromagnetic fields around neutron stars: exact vacuum solutions and related properties","J. Pétri",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","1","714","742","The magnetic field topology in the surrounding of neutron stars is one of the key questions in pulsar magnetospheric physics. A very extensive literature exists about the assumption of a dipolar magnetic field but very little progress has been made in attempts to include multipolar components in a self-consistent way. In this paper, we study the effect of multipolar electromagnetic fields anchored in the star. We give exact analytical solutions in closed form for any order l and apply them to the retarded point quadrupole (l = 2), hexapole (l = 3) and octopole (l = 4), a generalization of the retarded point dipole (l = 1). We also compare the Poynting flux from each multipole and show that the spin-down luminosity depends on the ratio R/rL, R being the neutron star radius and rL the light-cylinder radius. Therefore the braking index also depends on R/rL. As such multipole fields possess very different topology, most importantly smaller length scales compared to the dipolar field, especially close to the neutron star, we investigate the deformation of the polar caps induced by these multipolar fields. Such fields could have a strong impact on the interpretation of the pulsed radio emission suspected to emanate from these polar caps as well as on the inferred geometry deduced from the high-energy light-curve fitting and on the magnetic field strength. Discrepancies between the two-pole caustic model and our new multipole caustic model are emphasized with the quadrupole field. To this respect, we demonstrate that working with only a dipole field can be very misleading.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231513","magnetic fields;methods: analytical;stars: neutron;pulsars: general;stars: rotation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One mechanism may be magnetohydromagnetic forces and other processes acting on flare loops as seen in the Sun. The other mechanism may be forced local acoustic oscillations due to the high-energy particle impulse generated by the flare (known as ‘sunquakes’ in the Sun). We analyse short-cadence Kepler data of 257 flares in 75 stars to search for QPP in the flare decay branch or post-flare oscillations which may be attributed to either of these two mechanisms. About 18 per cent of stellar flares show a distinct bump in the flare decay branch of unknown origin. The bump does not seem to be a highly damped global oscillation because the periods of the bumps derived from wavelet analysis do not correlate with any stellar parameter. We detected damped oscillations covering several cycles (QPP), in seven flares on five stars. The periods of these oscillations also do not correlate with any stellar parameter, suggesting that these may be a due to flare loop oscillations. We searched for forced global oscillations which might result after a strong flare. To this end, we investigated the behaviour of the amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in eight stars before and after a flare. However, no clear amplitude change could be detected. We also analysed the amplitudes of the self-excited pulsations in two δ Scuti stars and one γ Doradus star before and after a flare. Again, no clear amplitude changes were found. Our conclusions are that a new process needs to be found to explain the high incidence of bumps in stellar flare light curves, that flare loop oscillations may have been detected in a few stars and that no conclusive evidence exists as yet for flare induced global acoustic oscillations (starquakes).","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231543","stars: activity;stars: flare","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Near-infrared and optical imaging data are used to extract surface brightness and colour profiles of the host galaxy and the wide polar structure in A0136-0801. The host galaxy dominates the light emission in all bands; the polar structure is more luminous in the optical bands and is three times more extended than the main spheroid. The average stellar population in the spheroid is redder than in the polar structure and we use their (B − K) versus (J − K) colours to constraint the ages of these populations using stellar population synthesis models. The inferred ages are 3–5 Gyr for the spheroid and 1–3 Gyr for the polar structure. We then use long slit spectra along the major axis of the polar structure to derive the emission line ratios and constrain the oxygen abundance, metallicity and star formation rate in this component. We find 12 + log (O/H) = 8.33 ± 0.43 and Z ≃ 0.32 Z⊙, using emission line ratios. These values are used, together with the ratio of the baryonic masses of the host galaxy and polar structure, to constrain the possible models for the formation scenario. We conclude that the tidal accretion of gas from a gas-rich donor or the disruption of a gas-rich satellite are formation mechanisms that may lead to systems with physical parameters in agreement with those measured for A0136-0801.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231538","methods: data analysis;galaxies: abundances;galaxies: formation;galaxies: individual: A0136-0801;galaxies: peculiar;galaxies: photometry","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Forensics of subhalo–stream encounters: the three phases of gap growth","D. Erkal; V. Belokurov",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","1","1136","1149","There is hope to discover dark matter subhaloes free of stars (predicted by the current theory of structure formation) by observing gaps they produce in tidal streams. In fact, this is the most promising technique for dark substructure detection and characterization as such gaps grow with time, magnifying small perturbations into clear signatures observable by ongoing and planned Galaxy surveys. To facilitate such future inference, we develop a comprehensive framework for studies of the growth of the stream density perturbations. Starting with simple assumptions and restricting to streams on circular orbits, we derive analytic formulae that describe the evolution of all gap properties (size, density contrast, etc.) at all times. We uncover complex, previously unnoticed behaviour, with the stream initially forming a density enhancement near the subhalo impact point. Shortly after, a gap forms due to the relative change in period induced by the subhalo's passage. There is an intermediate regime where the gap grows linearly in time. At late times, the particles in the stream overtake each other, forming caustics, and the gap grows like $\sqrt{t}$. In addition to the secular growth, we find that the gap oscillates as it grows due to epicyclic motion. We compare this analytic model to N-body simulations and find an impressive level of agreement. Importantly, when analysing the observation of a single gap we find a large degeneracy between the subhalo mass, the impact geometry and kinematics, the host potential, and the time since flyby.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231541","galaxies: haloes;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: structure;cosmology: theory;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The prolate molecular clouds in this investigation are set with their semimajor axes at inclinations between 0° and 90° to a plane-parallel ionizing radiation flux. A set of four parameters, the number density n, the ratio of major to minor axis γ, the inclination angle φ and the incident flux FEUV, are used to define the initial state of the simulated clouds. The dependence of the evolution of a prolate cloud under radiation-driven implosion (RDI) on each of the four parameters is investigated. It is found that (i) in addition to the well-studied standard type A, B or C bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs), many other types such as asymmetrical BRCs, filamentary structures and irregular horse-head structures could also be developed at H ii boundaries with only simple initial conditions; (ii) the final morphological structures are very sensitive to the four initial parameters, especially to the initial density and the inclination; (iii) the previously defined ionizing radiation penetration depth can still be used as a good indicator of the final morphology. Based on the simulation results, the formation time-scales and masses of the early RDI-triggered star formation from clouds of different initial conditions are also estimated. Finally a unified mechanism for the various morphological structures found in many different H ii boundaries is suggested.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231531","hydrodynamics;radiative transfer;stars: formation;ISM: evolution;H ii regions;ISM: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such discs are subject to a ‘vertical-shear instability’, which recent non-linear simulations have shown to drive hydrodynamic activity in the MRI-stable regions of protoplanetary discs. We first revisit locally isothermal discs using the quasi-global reduced model derived by Nelson et al. This analysis is then extended to global axisymmetric perturbations in a cylindrical domain. We also derive and study a reduced model describing discs with power-law radial entropy profiles (‘locally polytropic discs’), which are somewhat more realistic in that they possess physical (as opposed to numerical) surfaces. The fastest growing modes have very short wavelengths and are localized at the disc surfaces (if present), where the vertical shear is maximal. An additional class of modestly growing vertically global body modes is excited, corresponding to destabilized classical inertial waves (‘r modes’). We discuss the properties of both types of modes, and stress that those that grow fastest occur on the shortest available length-scales (determined either by the numerical grid or the physical viscous length). This ill-posedness makes simulations of the instability difficult to interpret. We end with some brief speculation on the non-linear saturation and resulting angular momentum transport.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231533","accretion, accretion discs;hydrodynamics;instabilities;waves;planetary systems","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

At core bounce, progenitors with rapid core rotation rates exhibit a characteristic GW signal which can be used to constrain the properties of the core of the progenitor star. We investigate the dynamics of rapidly rotating core collapse, focusing on hydrodynamic waves generated by the core bounce, and the GW spectrum they produce. The centrifugal distortion of the rapidly rotating proto-neutron star (PNS) leads to the generation of axisymmetric quadrupolar oscillations within the PNS and surrounding envelope. Using linear perturbation theory, we estimate the frequencies, amplitudes, damping times, and GW spectra of the oscillations. Our analysis provides a qualitative explanation for several features of the GW spectrum and shows reasonable agreement with non-linear hydrodynamic simulations, although a few discrepancies due to non-linear/rotational effects are evident. The dominant early post-bounce GW signal is produced by the fundamental quadrupolar oscillation mode of the PNS, at a frequency 0.70 ≲ f ≲ 0.80 kHz, whose energy is largely trapped within the PNS and leaks out on a ∼10-ms time-scale. Quasi-radial oscillations are not trapped within the PNS and quickly propagate outwards until they steepen into shocks. Both the PNS structure and Coriolis/centrifugal forces have a strong impact on the GW spectrum, and a detection of the GW signal can therefore be used to constrain progenitor properties.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231555","gravitational waves;hydrodynamics;waves;stars: oscillations;stars: rotation;supernovae: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, these surveys are subject to complicated target selection algorithms, which make it almost impossible to quantify to what extent the observational biases affect the observed populations. The LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic anticentre (LSS-GAC) follows a well-defined set of criteria for selecting targets for observations. This advantage over previous surveys has been fully exploited here to identify a small yet well-characterized magnitude-limited sample of hydrogen-rich (DA) white dwarfs. We derive preliminary LSS-GAC DA white dwarf luminosity and mass functions. The space density and average formation rate of DA white dwarfs we derive are 0.83 ± 0.16 × 10−3 pc−3 and 5.42 ± 0.08 × 10−13 pc−3 yr−1, respectively. Additionally, using an existing Monte Carlo population synthesis code we simulate the population of single DA white dwarfs in the Galacticanticentre, under various assumptions. The synthetic populations are passed through the LSS-GAC selection criteria, taking into account all possible observational biases. This allows us to perform a meaningful comparison of the observed and simulated distributions. We find that the LSS-GAC set of criteria is highly efficient in selecting white dwarfs for spectroscopic observations (80–85 per cent) and that, overall, our simulations reproduce well the observed luminosity function. However, they fail at reproducing an excess of massive white dwarfs present in the observed mass function. A plausible explanation for this is that a sizable fraction of massive white dwarfs in the Galaxy are the product of white dwarf–white dwarf mergers.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231519","stars: luminosity function, mass function;white dwarfs","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

An important step in this process is to determine the stellar parameters of the M-dwarf host star as accurately as possible. Different well-tested stellar model atmosphere simulations from different groups are widely applied to undertake this task. This paper provides a comparison of different model atmosphere families to allow a better estimate of systematic errors on host-star stellar parameter introduced by the use of one specific model atmosphere family only. We present a comparison of the atlas9, marcs, phoenix and drift-phoenix model atmosphere families including the M-dwarf parameter space (Teff = 2500–4000 K, log(g) = 3.0–5.0, [M/H] = −2.5to0.5). We examine the differences in the (Tgas, pgas)-structures, in synthetic photometric fluxes and in colour indices. Model atmospheres results for higher log(g) deviate considerably less between different models families than those for lower log(g) for all Teff = 2500–4000 K examined. We compiled the broad-band synthetic photometric fluxes for all available model atmospheres (incl. M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs) for the UKIRT WFCAM ZYJHK, 2MASS JHKs and Johnson UBVRI filters, and calculated related colour indices. Synthetic colours in the IR wavelengths diverge by no more than 0.15 dex amongst all model families. For all spectral bands considered, model discrepancies in colour diminish for higher Teff atmosphere simulations. We notice differences in synthetic colours between all model families and observed example data (including Kepler 42 and GJ1214).","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231521","stars: atmospheres;brown dwarfs;stars: late-type","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We present a method for obtaining the potential of disc galaxies from surface density images, assuming a vertical density distribution (height function), which is let to vary with position, thus enabling it to represent the geometry of a B/P. We construct a B/P height function after the results from a high-resolution, N-body+SPH simulation of an isolated galaxy and compare the resulting dynamical model to those obtained with the commonly used, position-independent ‘flat’ height functions. We show that methods that do not allow for a B/P can induce errors in the forces in the bar region of up to 40 per cent and demonstrate that this has a significant impact on the orbital structure of the model, which in turn determines its kinematics and morphology. Furthermore, we show that the bar strength is reduced in the presence of a B/P. We conclude that neglecting the vertical extent of a B/P can introduce considerable errors in the dynamical modelling. We also examine the errors introduced in the model due to uncertainties in the parameters of the B/P and show that even for generous but realistic values of the uncertainties, the error will be noticeably less than that of not modelling a B/P bulge at all.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231496","galaxies: bulges;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This applies especially to galaxies with SFRs below the main sequence (MS) value, which may be in their quenching phase. After that, the sample splits evenly between galaxies forming stars within a factor of 4 of the MS rate (∼45 per cent), and sub-MS galaxies with SFRs ∼10–1000 times smaller (∼55 per cent). We did not find a well-defined class of intermediate, transient objects below the MS, suggesting that the conversion of a massive MS galaxy into a quenched remnant may take a relatively short time (<1 Gyr), though a larger sample should be analysed in the same way to set precise limits on the quenching time-scale. X-ray detected AGNs represent a ∼30 per cent fraction of the sample, and are found among both star-forming and quenched galaxies. The morphological analysis revealed that ∼50 per cent of our massive objects are bulge-dominated, and almost all MS galaxies with a relevant bulge component host an AGN.

"On feathers, bifurcations and shells: the dynamics of tidal streams across the mass scale","N. C. Amorisco",NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","1","575","591","I present an organic description of the spectrum of regimes of collisionless tidal streams and define the orderings between the relevant physical quantities that shape their morphology. Three fundamental dichotomies are identified and described in the form of dimensionless inequalities. These govern (i) the speed of the stream's growth, (ii) the internal coherence of the stream and (iii) its thickness or opening angle, within and outside the orbital plane. The mechanisms through which such main qualitative properties are regulated and the relevant limiting cases are analysed. For example, the slope of the host's density profile strongly influences the speed of the stream's growth, in both length and width, as steeper density profiles enhance differential streaming. Internal coherence is the natural requirement for the appearance of substructure and overdensities in tidal debris, and I concentrate on the characteristic ‘feathering’ typical of streams of star clusters. Overdensities and substructures are associated with minima in the relative streaming velocity of the stream members. For streams with high circularity, these are caused by the epicyclic oscillations of stars; however, for highly non-circular progenitor's orbits, internal substructure is caused by the oscillating differences in energy and actions with which material is shed at different orbital phases of the progenitor. This modulation results in different streaming speeds along the tidal arm: the streakline of material shed between two successive apocentric passages is folded along its length, pulled at its centre by the faster differential streaming of particles released near pericentre, which are therefore more widely scattered. When the stream is coherent enough, the same mechanism is potentially capable of generating a bimodal profile in the density distributions of the longer wraps of more massive progenitors, which I dub ‘bifurcations’. The conditions that allow streams to be internally coherent are explored and I comment on the cases of Palomar 5, Willman 1, the Anticenter and Sagittarius’ streams. Analytical methods are accompanied by numerical experiments, performed using a purposely built generative model, also presented here.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231539","methods: analytical;methods: numerical;galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We list all of the starless cores and perform a full virial analysis, including external pressure. This is the first time that external pressure has been included in this level of detail. We find that the majority of our cores are either bound or virialized. Gravitational energy and external pressure are on average of a similar order of magnitude, but with some variation from region to region. We find that cores in the Oph A region are gravitationally bound prestellar cores, while cores in the Oph C and E regions are pressure-confined. We determine that N2H+ is a good tracer of the bound material of prestellar cores, although we find some evidence for N2H+ freeze-out at the very highest core densities. We find that non-thermal linewidths decrease substantially between the gas traced by C18O and that traced by N2H+, indicating the dissipation of turbulence at higher densities. We find that the critical Bonnor–Ebert stability criterion is not a good indicator of the boundedness of our cores. We detect the pre-brown dwarf candidate Oph B-11 and find a flux density and mass consistent with previous work. We discuss regional variations in the nature of the cores and find further support for our previous hypothesis of a global evolutionary gradient across the cloud from south-west to north-east, indicating sequential star formation across the region.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231483","stars: formation;dust, extinction;ISM: individual objects: L1688;ISM: individual objects: L1689;ISM: kinematics and dynamics;submillimetre: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Unlike our previous models, we include an outflow from the inner accretion flow. Two different kinds of outflows are modelled: (i) an instantaneous-response feedback mode, in which the outflow rate is directly proportional to the current black hole gas capture rate; and (ii) an outburst mode, which is stronger but lasts for a limited time. The latter situation may be particularly relevant to Sgr A*, since there is evidence that Sgr A* was much brighter in the recent past. We find that both types of outflow perturb the gas dynamics near the Bondi radius and the black hole capture rate significantly. The effects persist longer than the outflow itself. We also compare the effects of spherically symmetric and collimated outflows, and find that the latter are far less efficient in transferring its energy to the surrounding gas near the capture radius. Our results imply that accretion feedback is important for non-radiative accretion flows not only within but also outside the capture radius. Steady-state Bondi accretion rate estimates that do not account for feedback outflows overpredict not only the accretion rate on to the black hole but also the capture rate at the Bondi radius itself. Finally, the steady-state assumption under which non-radiative flows have been routinely studied in the literature may have to be abandoned if accretion feedback is bursty in nature.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231509","accretion, accretion discs;Galaxy: centre","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This means that astronomical spectrographs trade-off throughput with spectral resolving power. Recently, optical guided-wave transitions known as photonic lanterns have been proposed to circumvent this trade-off, by enabling the efficient reformatting of multimode light into a pseudo-slit which is highly multimode in one axis, but diffraction-limited in the other. Here, we demonstrate the successful reformatting of a telescope point spread function into such a slit using a three-dimensional integrated optical waveguide device, which we name the photonic dicer. Using the CANARY adaptive optics (AO) demonstrator on the William Herschel Telescope, and light centred at 1530 nm with a 160 nm full width at half-maximum, the device shows a transmission of between 10 and 20 per cent depending upon the type of AO correction applied. Most of the loss is due to the overfilling of the input aperture in poor and moderate seeing. Taking this into account, the photonic device itself has a transmission of 57 ± 4 per cent. We show how a fully-optimized device can be used with AO to provide efficient spectroscopy at high spectral resolution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231484","instrumentation: adaptive optics;instrumentation: spectrographs","","","","","3","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Fitting of the UV-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution shows little evidence of extinction and the X-ray spectral analysis does not confirm previous reports of deep absorption edges from O viii. HE 0436–4717 is a ‘bare' Seyfert with negligible line-of-sight absorption making it ideal to study the central X-ray emitting region. Three scenarios were considered to describe the X-ray data: partial covering absorption, blurred reflection, and soft Comptonization. All three interpretations describe the 0.5–10.0 keV spectra well. Extrapolating the models to $100{\rm \thinspace keV}$ results in poorer fits for the partial covering model. When also considering the rapid variability during one of the XMM–Newton observations, the blurred reflection model appears to describe all the observations in the most self-consistent manner. If adopted, the blurred reflection model requires a very low iron abundance in HE 0436–4717. We consider the possibilities that this is an artefact of the fitting process, but it appears possible that it is intrinsic to the object.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231487","galaxies: active;galaxies: individual: HE 0436–4717;galaxies: nuclei;galaxies: Seyfert;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The gas contents in high-redshift galaxies are obtained by combining the empirical star formation histories and star formation models that relate star formation rate with the cold gas mass in galaxies. We find that the total baryon mass in low-mass galaxies is always much less than the universal baryon mass fraction since z = 2, regardless of star formation model adopted. The data for the evolution of the gas phase metallicity require net metal outflow at z ≲ 2, and the metal loading factor is constrained to be about 0.01, or about 60 per cent of the metal yield. Based on the assumption that galactic outflow is more enriched in metal than both the interstellar medium and the material ejected at earlier epochs, we are able to put stringent constraints on the upper limits for both the net accretion rate and the net mass outflow rate. The upper limits strongly suggest that the evolution of the gas phase metallicity and gas mass fraction for low-mass galaxies at z < 2 is not compatible with strong outflow. We speculate that the low star formation efficiency of low-mass galaxies is owing to some preventative processes that prevent gas from accreting into galaxies in the first place.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231548","methods: statistical;galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: formation;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A large set of 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic simulations was carried out for axisymmetric viscous/diffusive disc accretion to rotating magnetized stars for the purpose of assessing the conditions where the outflows are asymmetric relative to the equatorial plane. We consider initial magnetic fields that are symmetric about the equatorial plane and consist of a radially distributed field threading the disc (disc field) and a stellar dipole field. (1) For pure disc-fields the symmetry or asymmetry of the outflows is affected by the mid-plane plasma β of the disc. For discs with small plasma β, outflows are symmetric to within 10 per cent over time-scales of hundreds of inner disc orbits. For higher β discs, the coupling of the upper and lower coronal plasmas is broken, and quasi-periodic field motion leads to asymmetric episodic outflows. (2) Accreting stars with a stellar dipole field and no disc-field exhibit episodic, two component outflows – a magnetospheric wind and an inner disc wind. Both are characterized by similar velocity profiles but the magnetospheric wind has densities ≳ 10 times that of the disc wind. (3) Adding a disc field parallel to the stellar dipole field enhances the magnetospheric winds but suppresses the disc wind. (4) Adding a disc field which is antiparallel to the stellar dipole field in the disc suppresses the magnetospheric and disc winds.

The resulting turbulent flow saturates at an average Mach number of ∼2.5 and is analysed through density and velocity power spectra, including an investigation of the evolution of the solenoidal and compressional components. We obtain a shallow density power spectrum with a slope of ∼−1.2 attributed to the presence of a network of localized dense filamentary structures formed by strong shock interactions. The total velocity power spectrum slope is found to be ∼−2.0, representative of the Burgers shock-dominated turbulence model. The density-weighted velocity power spectrum slope is measured as ∼−1.6, slightly less than the expected Kolmogorov scaling value (slope of −5/3) found in previous works. The discrepancy may be caused by the nature of our real-space-driving model, and we suggest that there is no universal scaling law for supersonic compressible turbulence. We find that on average, solenoidal modes slightly dominate in our turbulence model as the interaction between strong curved compressible shocks generates solenoidal modes, and compressible modes decay faster.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231544","hydrodynamics;turbulence;ISM: clouds;ISM: jets and outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To do that, we performed several sets of simulations for 10 000 asteroids having different spin axis orientations, rotational periods and shapes. The observational epochs used for each simulation were extracted from the Gaia mission simulator developed at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, while the brightness was generated using a Z-buffer standard graphic method. We also explored the influence on the inversion results of contaminating the data set with Gaussian noise with different σ values. The research enabled us to determine a correlation between the reliability of the inversion method and the asteroid's pole latitude. In particular, the results are biased for asteroids having quasi-spherical shapes and low pole latitudes. This effect is caused by the low light-curve amplitude observed under such circumstances, as the periodic signal can be lost in the photometric random noise when both values are comparable, causing the inversion to fail. Such bias might be taken into account when analysing the inversion results, not to mislead it with physical effects such as non-gravitational forces. Finally, we studied what impact on the inversion results has combining a full light curve and Gaia photometry collected simultaneously. Using this procedure we have shown that it is possible to reduce the number of wrong solutions for asteroids having less than 50 data points. The latter will be of special importance for planning ground-based observations of asteroids aiming to enhance the scientific impact of Gaia on Solar system science.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231528","methods: numerical;techniques: photometric;minor planets, asteroids: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Earlier H α and near-IR [Fe ii] imaging revealed that the two emission lines trace substantially different morphologies in the inner ∼40 arcsec of the outflow. H α traces a broad cocoon that surrounds the collimated [Fe ii] jet that extends throughout the parent dust pillar. New spectra show that this discrepancy extends to their kinematics. Near-IR [Fe ii] emission traces steady, fast velocities of ±200 km s−1 from the eastern and western limbs of the jet. We compare this to a previously published H α spectrum that reveals a Hubble-flow velocity structure near the jet-driving source. New, second-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) H α images reveal the lateral spreading of the H α outflow lobe away from the jet axis. H α proper motions also indicate a sudden increase in the mass-loss rate ∼1000 yr ago, while steady [Fe ii] emission throughout the inner jet suggest that the burst is ongoing. An accretion burst sustained for ∼1000 yr is an order of magnitude longer than expected for FU Orionis outbursts, but represents only a small fraction of the total age of the HH 666 outflow. Altogether, available data suggests that [Fe ii] traces the highly collimated protostellar jet while H α traces the entrained and irradiated outflow.

The vertically integrated equations are simplified using the slow accretion limit and the monopole approximation with a time-dependent central point mass to account for self-gravity and accretion. It is shown that the system of partial differential equations can be reduced to a single non-linear advection diffusion equation which describes the time evolution of angular velocity. In order to solve the equation, three different turbulent viscosity prescriptions are considered. It is shown that for these parametrizations the differential equation allows for similarity transformations depending only on a single non-dimensional parameter. A detailed analysis of the similarity solutions reveals that this parameter is the initial power-law exponent of the angular velocity distribution at large radii. The radial dependence of the self-similar solutions is in most cases given by broken power laws. At small radii, the rotation law always becomes Keplerian with respect to the current central point mass. In the outer regions, the power-law exponent of the rotation law deviates from the Keplerian value and approaches asymptotically the value determined by the initial condition. It is shown that accretion discs with flatter rotation laws at large radii yield higher accretion rates. The methods are applied to self-gravitating accretion discs in active galacticnuclei. Fully self-gravitating discs are found to evolve faster than nearly Keplerian discs. The implications on supermassive black hole formation and Quasar evolution are discussed.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231511","accretion, accretion discs;methods: analytical;galaxies: active","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Data augmentation makes a training sample more closely resemble a test sample, if the two base samples differ, in order to improve measured statistics of the test sample. We perform two sets of analyses by selecting 800 000 (1.7 million) Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 (Data Release 10) galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We construct a base training set by imposing an artificial r-band apparent magnitude cut to select only bright galaxies and then augment this base training set by using simulations and by applying the k-correct package to artificially place training set galaxies at a higher redshift. We obtain redshift estimates for the remaining faint galaxy sample, which are not used during training. We find that data augmentation reduces the error on the recovered redshifts by 40 per cent in both sets of analyses, when compared to the difference in error between the ideal case and the non-augmented case. The outlier fraction is also reduced by at least 10 per cent and up to 80 per cent using data augmentation. We finally quantify how the recovered redshifts degrade as one probes to deeper magnitudes past the artificial magnitude limit of the bright training sample. We find that at all apparent magnitudes explored, the use of data augmentation with tree-based methods provide an estimate of the galaxy redshift with a low value of bias, although the error on the recovered redshifts increases as we probe to deeper magnitudes. These results have applications for surveys which have a spectroscopic training set which forms a biased sample of all photometric galaxies, for example if the spectroscopic detection magnitude limit is shallower than the photometric limit.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231514","catalogues;surveys;galaxies: distances and redshifts","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have used 2D bulge–disc–bar decomposition to determine structural parameters of 185 S0 galaxies and 31 nearby spiral galaxies. Using the Sérsic index and the position on the Kormendy diagram to classify their bulges as either classical or pseudo, we find that 25 S0s (14 per cent) and 24 spirals (77 per cent) host pseudo-bulges. The fraction of pseudo-bulges we find in spiral galaxies is consistent with previous results obtained with optical data and show that the evolution of a large fraction of spirals is governed by secular processes rather than by major mergers. We find that the bulge effective radius is correlated with the disc scale length for pseudo-bulges of S0s and spirals, as expected for secular formation of bulges from disc instabilities, though the discs in S0s are significantly smaller than those in spirals. We show that early-type pseudo-bulge hosting spirals can transform to pseudo-bulge hosting S0s by simple gas stripping. However, simple gas stripping mechanism is not sufficient to transform the late-type pseudo-bulge hosting spirals into pseudo-bulge hosting S0s.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231547","galaxies: bulges;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: photometry;galaxies: spiral;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Shocks and magnetic reconnection have long been considered as possible candidates for powering the jet emission. Recent progress via fully-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations allows us to revisit this issue on firm physical grounds. We show that shock models are unlikely to account for the jet emission. In fact, when shocks are efficient at dissipating energy, they typically do not accelerate particles far beyond the thermal energy, and vice versa. In contrast, we show that magnetic reconnection can deposit more than 50 per cent of the dissipated energy into non-thermal leptons as long as the energy density of the magnetic field in the bulk flow is larger than the rest-mass energy density. The emitting region, i.e. the reconnection downstream, is characterized by a rough energy equipartition between magnetic fields and radiating particles, which naturally accounts for a commonly observed property of blazar jets.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231534","acceleration of particles;magnetic reconnection;radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;shock waves;gamma-ray burst: general;galaxies: jets","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We used the Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph and the William Herschel Telescope/AutoFib2+WYFFOS to confirm 83 Hα emitters in and around the merging cluster. We find that cluster star-forming galaxies in the hottest X-ray gas and/or in the cluster subcores (away from the shock fronts) show high [S ii]6716/[S ii]6761 and high [S ii] 6716/Hα, implying very low electron densities (<30 × lower than all other star-forming galaxies outside the cluster) and/or significant contribution from supernovae, respectively. All cluster star-forming galaxies near the cluster centre show evidence of significant outflows (blueshifted Na D ∼200–300 km s−1), likely driven by supernovae. Strong outflows are also found for the cluster Hα active galactic nucleus (AGN). Hα star-forming galaxies in the merging cluster follow the z ∼ 0 mass–metallicity relation, showing systematically higher metallicity (∼0.15–0.2 dex) than Hα emitters outside the cluster (projected R > 2.5 Mpc). This suggests that the shock front may have triggered remaining metal-rich gas which galaxies were able to retain into forming stars. Our observations show that the merger of impressively massive (∼1015 M⊙) clusters can provide the conditions for significant star formation and AGN activity, but, as we witness strong feedback by star-forming galaxies and AGN (and given how massive the merging cluster is), such sources will likely quench in a few 100 Myr.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231492","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: clusters: individual: CIZA J2242.8+5301;galaxies: evolution;intergalactic medium;cosmology: observations;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To study their star formation properties, we uniformly survey the ‘Sausage’ and ‘Toothbrush’ clusters in broad- and narrow-band filters and select a sample of 201 and 463 line emitters, down to a rest-frame equivalent width (13 Å). We robustly separate between Hα and higher redshift emitters using a combination of optical multiband (B, g, V, r, i, z) and spectroscopic data. We build Hα luminosity functions for the entire cluster region, near the shock fronts, and away from the shock fronts and find striking differences between the two clusters. In the dynamically younger, 1 Gyr old ‘Sausage’ cluster we find numerous (59) Hα emitters above a star formation rate (SFR) of 0.17 M⊙ yr−1 surprisingly located in close proximity to the shock fronts, embedded in very hot intracluster medium plasma. The SFR density for the cluster population is at least at the level of typical galaxies at z ∼ 2. Down to the same SFR, the possibly dynamically more evolved ‘Toothbrush’ cluster has only nine Hα galaxies. The cluster Hα galaxies fall on the SFR–stellar mass relation z ∼ 0.2 for the field. However, the ‘Sausage’ cluster has an Hα emitter density >20 times that of blank fields. If the shock passes through gas-rich cluster galaxies, the compressed gas could collapse into dense clouds and excite star formation for a few 100 Myr. This process ultimately leads to a rapid consumption of the molecular gas, accelerating the transformation of gas-rich field spirals into cluster S0s or ellipticals.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231478","shock waves;galaxies: clusters: individual: CIZA J2242.8+5301;galaxies: clusters: individual: 1RXS J0603.3+4213;galaxies: evolution;cosmology: observations;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Of these SNe, 15 SNe Ia and eight SNe II are new discoveries reported here for the first time. We use our SN samples to measure SN rates per unit mass as a function of galaxy stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR (sSFR), as derived by the MPA-JHU Galspec pipeline. We show that correlations between SN Ia and SN II rates per unit mass and galaxy stellar mass, SFR, and sSFR can be explained by a combination of the respective SN delay-time distributions (the distributions of times that elapse between the formation of a stellar population and all ensuing SNe), the ages of the surveyed galaxies, the redshifts at which they are observed, and their star formation histories. This model was first suggested by Kistler et al. for the SN Ia rate–mass correlation, but is expanded here to SNe II and to correlations with galaxy SFR and sSFR.

These lines provide a unique tool to identify and measure magnetism in the coolest and oldest white dwarfs in the Galaxy. We report the identification of seven strongly metal polluted, cool (Teff < 8000 K) white dwarfs with magnetic field strengths ranging from 1.9 to 9.6 MG.

Such a plateau arises naturally in the Collapsar model. In this model, the engine has to operate long enough to push the jet out of the stellar envelope and the observed duration of the burst is the difference between the engine's operation time and the jet breakout time. The jet breakout time inferred from the duration distribution (∼10 s in the burst's frame) is comparable to the breakout time of both analytic estimates and numerical simulations (both 2D and 3D) of a hydrodynamic jet (∼10 s for typical parameters). Recently, we have estimated analytically the breakout time of a Poynting-flux-dominated jet and have shown that it is consistent with 2D numerical simulations. We find that such a jet with the same overall energy breaks out much faster (≲1 s). If this result holds for 3D simulations it implies that only hydrodynamic jets are compatible with the duration of the plateau in the GRB duration distribution and hence the jet should be hydrodynamic during most of the time that its head is within the envelope of the progenitor star and around the time when it emerges from the star. This would naturally arise if the jet forms as a hydrodynamic jet in the first place or if it forms Poynting flux dominated but dissipates most of its magnetic energy early on within the progenitor star and emerges as a hydrodynamic jet.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231481","hydrodynamics;MHD;methods: analytical;methods: statistical;gamma-ray burst: general;stars: Wolf-Rayet","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Based on this model, the observed metallicities and their gradients can be described surprisingly well by the radially averaged distribution of the ratio of stellar mass to ISM gas mass. The comparison between observed and model-predicted metallicity is used to constrain the rate of mass-loss through galactic wind and accretion gain in units of the star formation rate. Three groups of galaxies are found: galaxies with either mostly winds and only weak accretion, or mostly accretion and only weak winds, and galaxies where winds are roughly balanced by accretion. The three groups are distinct in the properties of their gas discs. Galaxies with approximately equal rates of mass-loss and accretion gain have low metallicity, atomic-hydrogen-dominated gas discs with a flat spatial profile. The other two groups have gas discs dominated by molecular hydrogen out to 0.5 to 0.7 isophotal radii and show a radial exponential decline, which is on average steeper for the galaxies with small accretion rates. The rates of accretion ( ≲ 1.0 × SFR) and outflow ( ≲ 2.4 × SFR) are relatively low. The latter depend on the calibration of the zero-point of the metallicity determination from the use of H ii region strong emission lines.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231493","Galaxy: evolution;galaxies: abundances;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: spiral","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This includes models in which the rotation curve has a finite central value but declines outwards (like the Jaffe model). It includes models in which the rotation curve is rising in the inner parts, but flattens asymptotically (like the Binney model). The family encompasses models with both finite and singular (cuspy) density profiles. The self-consistent distribution function depending on binding energy E and angular momentum L is derived and the kinematical properties of the models discussed. These really describe the properties of the total matter (both luminous and dark). For comparison with observations, it is better to consider tracer populations of stars. These can be used to represent elliptical galaxies or the spheroidal components of spiral galaxies. Accordingly, we study the properties of tracers with power-law or Einasto profiles moving in the doubloon potential. Under the assumption of spherical alignment, we provide a simple way to solve the Jeans equations for the velocity dispersions. This choice of alignment is supported by observations on the stellar halo of the Milky Way. Power-law tracers have prolate spheroidal velocity ellipsoids everywhere. However, this is not the case for Einasto tracers, for which the velocity ellipsoids change from prolate to oblate spheroidal near the pole. Asymptotic forms of the velocity distributions close to the escape speed are also derived, with an eye to application to the high-velocity stars in the Milky Way. Power-law tracers have power-law or Maxwellian velocity distributions tails, whereas Einasto tracers have superexponential cut-offs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231522","galaxies: haloes;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

(1) Previous work has shown that the correction to the lowest order perturbation δd/d = −δv/cz has the peculiar characteristic that it appears to depend on the absolute state of motion of sources, rather than on their motion relative to that of the observer. The resolution of this apparent violation of the equivalence principle is that it is necessary to allow for evolution of the velocities with time, and also, when considering perturbations on the scale of the observer–source separation, to include the gravitational redshift effect. We provide an expression for δd/d that provides a physically consistent way to measure peculiar velocities and determine their impact for SN1a cosmology. (2) We then calculate the perturbation to the redshift as a function of source flux density, which has been proposed as an alternative probe of large-scale motions. We show how the inclusion of surface brightness modulation modifies the relation between δz(m) and the peculiar velocity, and that, while the noise properties of this method might appear promising, the velocity signal is swamped by the effect of galaxy clustering for most scales of interest. (3) We show how, in linear theory, peculiar velocity measurements are biased downwards by the effect of smaller scale motions or by measurement errors (such as in photometric redshifts). Our results nicely explain the effects seen in simulations by Koda et al.

The KAIT data base contains multiple pre-SN images for five SNe IIn (plus one ambiguous case of an SN IIn/imposter) within 50 Mpc. No progenitor outbursts are found using the false discovery rate statistical method in any of our targets. Instead, we derive limiting magnitudes (LMs) at the locations of the SNe. These LMs (typically reaching mR ≈ 19.5 mag) are compared to outbursts of SN 2009ip and η Car, plus additional simulated outbursts. We find that the data for SN 1999el and SN 2003dv are of sufficient quality to rule out events ∼40 d before the main peak caused by initially faint SNe from blue supergiant precursor stars, as in the cases of SN 2009ip and SN 2010mc. These SNe IIn may thus have arisen from red supergiant progenitors, or they may have had a more rapid onset of circumstellar matter interaction. We also estimate the probability of detecting at least one outburst in our data set to be ≳60% for each type of the example outbursts, so the lack of any detections suggests that such outbursts are either typically less luminous (intrinsically or owing to dust) than ∼−13 mag, or not very common among SNe IIn within a few years prior to explosion.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231502","stars: massive;stars: mass-loss;supernovae: general;supernovae: individual: SN 1999el, SN 2003dv, SN 2006am, SN 2008fq, SN 2010jl, SN 2011A","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume ‘overlap’. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code gizmo:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require ‘artificial diffusion’ terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced ‘particle noise’ and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of ‘grid alignment’ effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize ‘grid noise’.

In addition to the narrow rovibrational lines of H2 which are familiar from gas-phase spectroscopy, the data manifest double transitions and broad phonon branches that are characteristic specifically of hydrogen in the solid phase. These transitions are of interest because they provide a spectral signature which is independent of the impurity content of the matrix. We have used our data, in combination with a model of the ultraviolet absorptions of the H2 molecule, to construct the dielectric function of solid para-H2 over a broad range of frequencies. Our results will be useful in determining the electromagnetic response of small particles of solid hydrogen. The dielectric function makes it clear that pure H2 dust would contribute to infrared (IR) extinction predominantly by scattering starlight, rather than absorbing it, and the characteristic IR absorption spectrum of the hydrogen matrix itself will be difficult to observe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231553","molecular processes;scattering;dust, extinction;ISM: molecules","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The uncertainties in this rate span two orders of magnitude in the current literature, and so it remains a source of uncertainty in our knowledge of Population III star formation. Here, we investigate how the amount of fragmentation in primordial gas depends on the adopted three-body rate. We present the results of calculations that follow the chemical and thermal evolution of primordial gas as it collapses in two dark matter minihaloes. Our results on the effect of three-body rate on the evolution until the first protostar forms agree well with previous studies. However, our modified version of gadget-2 smoothed particle hydrodynamics also includes sink particles, which allows us to follow the initial evolution of the accretion disc that builds up on the centre of each halo, and capture the fragmentation in gas as well as its dependence on the adopted three-body H2 formation rate. We find that the fragmentation behaviour of the gas is only marginally affected by the choice of three-body rate co-efficient, and that halo-to-halo differences are of equal importance in affecting the final mass distribution of stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231546","hydrodynamics;instabilities;stars: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The approach utilizes ‘virtual-packets’ that are generated during the propagation of the Monte Carlo quanta and used to compute synthetic observables for specific observer orientations. Compared to extracting synthetic observables by direct binning of emergent Monte Carlo quanta, this virtual-packet approach leads to a substantial reduction in the Monte Carlo noise. This is not only vital for calculating synthetic spectropolarimetry (since the degree of polarization is typically very small) but also useful for calculations of light curves and spectra. We first validate our approach via application of an idealized test code to simple geometries. We then describe its implementation in the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code artis and present test calculations for simple models for Type Ia supernovae. Specifically, we use the well-known one-dimensional W7 model to verify that our scheme can accurately recover zero polarization from a spherical model, and to demonstrate the reduction in Monte Carlo noise compared to a simple packet-binning approach. To investigate the impact of aspherical ejecta on the polarization spectra, we then use artis to calculate synthetic observables for prolate and oblate ellipsoidal models with Type Ia supernova compositions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231542","polarization;radiative transfer;methods: numerical;supernovae: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

HS Sge and V528 Aql show evidence for a (comparatively) high system inclination, which makes them attractive targets for time series observations.

Wyse",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","1","209","222","If the dark matter (DM) were composed of axions, then structure formation in the Universe would be suppressed below the axion Jeans scale. Using an analytic model for the halo mass function of a mixed DM model with axions and cold dark matter, combined with the abundance-matching technique, we construct the UV-luminosity function. Axions suppress high-z galaxy formation and the UV-luminosity function is truncated at a faintest limiting magnitude. From the UV-luminosity function, we predict the reionization history of the universe and find that axion DM causes reionization to occur at lower redshift. We search for evidence of axions using the Hubble Ultra Deep Field UV-luminosity function in the redshift range z = 6–10, and the optical depth to reionization, τ, as measured from cosmic microwave background polarization. All probes we consider consistently exclude ma ≲ 10−23 eV from contributing more than half of the DM, with our strongest constraint ruling this model out at more than 8σ significance. In conservative models of reionization a dominant component of DM with ma = 10−22 eV is in 3σ tension with the measured value of τ, putting pressure on an axion solution to the cusp-core problem. Tension is reduced to 2σ for the axion contributing only half of the DM. A future measurement of the UV-luminosity function in the range z = 10–13 by JWST would provide further evidence for or against ma = 10−22 eV. Probing still higher masses of ma = 10−21 eV will be possible using future measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect by Advanced ACTPol to constrain the time and duration of reionization.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231525","elementary particles;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: luminosity function, mass function;cosmology: theory;dark ages, reionization, first stars;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The ionization structure of the pillars was studied in great detail over almost the entire visible wavelength range, and maps of the relevant physical parameters, e.g. extinction, electron density, electron temperature, line-of-sight velocity of the ionized and neutral gas are shown. In agreement with previous authors, we find that the pillar tips are being ionized and photoevaporated by the massive members of the nearby cluster NGC 6611. They display a stratified ionization structure where the emission lines peak in a descending order according to their ionization energies. The IFU data allowed us to analyse the kinematics of the photoevaporative flow in terms of the stratified ionization structure, and we find that, in agreement with simulations, the photoevaporative flow is traced by a blueshift in the position-velocity profile. The gas kinematics and ionization structure have allowed us to produce a sketch of the 3D geometry of the Pillars, positioning the pillars with respect to the ionizing cluster stars. We use a novel method to detect a previously unknown bipolar outflow at the tip of the middle pillar and suggest that it has an embedded protostar as its driving source. Furthermore we identify a candidate outflow in the leftmost pillar. With the derived physical parameters and ionic abundances, we estimate a mass-loss rate due to the photoevaporative flow of 70 M⊙ Myr−1 which yields an expected lifetime of approximately 3 Myr.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231550","H ii regions;ISM: jets and outflows;ISM: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Motivated by recent results highlighting radically different evolutionary pathways between early- and late-type galaxies, we present results from a simple Bayesian approach to this problem wherein we model the star formation history (SFH) of a galaxy with two parameters, [t, τ] and compare the predicted and observed optical and near-ultraviolet colours. We use a novel method to investigate the morphological differences between the most probable SFHs for both disc-like and smooth-like populations of galaxies, by using a sample of 126 316 galaxies (0.01 < z < 0.25) with probabilistic estimates of morphology from Galaxy Zoo. We find a clear difference between the quenching time-scales preferred by smooth- and disc-like galaxies, with three possible routes through the green valley dominated by smooth- (rapid time-scales, attributed to major mergers), intermediate- (intermediate time-scales, attributed to minor mergers and galaxy interactions) and disc-like (slow time-scales, attributed to secular evolution) galaxies. We hypothesize that morphological changes occur in systems which have undergone quenching with an exponential time-scale τ < 1.5 Gyr, in order for the evolution of galaxies in the green valley to match the ratio of smooth to disc galaxies observed in the red sequence. These rapid time-scales are instrumental in the formation of the red sequence at earlier times; however, we find that galaxies currently passing through the green valley typically do so at intermediate time-scales.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231479","galaxies: abundances;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: general;galaxies: photometry;galaxies: statistics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

All sources but one were resolved, with the majority showing core-jet morphology typical for radio-loud quasars. We discuss in detail the most interesting cases. The high radio luminosities and small linear sizes of the observed objects indicate they are strong young active galactic nuclei. Nevertheless, the distribution of the radio-loudness parameter, log RI, of a larger sample of AI quasars shows that the objects observed by us constitute the most luminous, small subgroup of the AI population. Additionally, we report that for the radio-loudness parameter, the distribution of AI quasars and that for those selected using the traditional balnicity index differ significantly. Strong absorption is connected with lower log RI and thus probably larger viewing angles. Since the AI quasars have on average larger log RI, the orientation can mean that we see them less absorbed. However, we suggest that the orientation is not the only parameter that affects the detected absorption. That the strong absorption is associated with the weak radio emission is equally important and worth exploring.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231500","galaxies: active;galaxies: evolution;quasars: absorption lines","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Based on the high-dispersion spectra of selected such 55 red giants in the Kepler field with precisely known seismic parameters (among which parallaxes are available for nine stars), we checked the accuracy of the determination method of stellar parameters previously applied to many red giants by Takeda et al. (PASJ, 60, 781), since it may be possible to discriminate their complex evolutionary status by using the surface gravity versus mass diagram. We confirmed that our spectroscopic gravity and the seismic gravity satisfactorily agree with each other (to within ≃0.1 dex) without any systematic difference. However, the mass values of He-burning red clump giants derived from stellar evolutionary tracks (∼2–3 M⊙) were found to be markedly larger by ∼50 per cent compared to the seismic values (∼1–2 M⊙) though such discrepancy is not seen for normal giants in the H-burning phase, which reflects the difficulty of mass determination from intricately overlapping tracks on the luminosity versus effective temperature diagram. This consequence implies that the mass results of many red giants in the clump region determined by Takeda et al. are likely to be significantly overestimated. We also compare our spectroscopically established parameters with recent literature values, and further discuss the prospect of distinguishing the evolutionary status of red giants based on the conventional (i.e. non-seismic) approach.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231551","stars: abundances;stars: atmospheres;stars: evolution;stars: late-type;stars: oscillations","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Smooth and dense filaments, several comoving mega parsec long, form generically above z ∼ 2 in this model. Atomic line cooling allows gas in the centres of these filaments to cool to the base of the cooling function, resulting in a very striking pattern of extended Lyman-limit systems (LLSs). Observations of the correlation function of LLSs might hence provide useful limits on the nature of the dark matter. We argue that the self-shielding of filaments may lead to a thermal instability resulting in star formation. We implement a sub-grid model for this, and find that filaments rather than haloes dominate star formation until z ∼ 6, although this depends on how stars form in WDM. Reionization decreases the gas density in filaments, and the more usual star formation in haloes dominates below z ∼ 6, although star formation in filaments continues until z = 2. 15 per cent of the stars of the z = 0 galaxy formed in filaments.

We have determined abundances of representative light proton-capture, α, Fe-peak and neutron-capture element groups, and combined them with photometry of multiple sequences observed along the colour–magnitude diagram. Our principal results are: (i) a broad, bimodal distribution in s-process element abundance ratios, with two main groups, the s-poor and s-rich groups; (ii) substantial star-to-star Fe variations, with the s-rich stars having higher Fe, e.g. $\langle [\mathrm{Fe/H}]\rangle _{s{\hbox{-}\rm rich}} - \langle [\mathrm{Fe/H}]\rangle _{s{\hbox{-}\rm poor}}$ ∼ 0.2 dex; and (iii) the presence of O–Na–Al (anti)correlations in both stellar groups. We have defined a new photometric index, cBVI = (B − V) − (V − I), to maximize the separation in the colour–magnitude diagram between the two stellar groups with different Fe and s-element content, and this index is not significantly affected by variations in light elements (such as the O–Na anticorrelation). The variations in the overall metallicity present in NGC 5286 add this object to the class of anomalous GCs. Furthermore, the chemical abundance pattern of NGC 5286 resembles that observed in some of the anomalous GCs, e.g. M 22, NGC 1851, M 2, and the more extreme ω Centauri, that also show internal variations in s-elements, and in light elements within stars with different Fe and s-elements content. In view of the common variations in s-elements, we propose the term s-Fe-anomalous GCs to describe this sub-class of objects. The similarities in chemical abundance ratios between these objects strongly suggest similar formation and evolution histories, possibly associated with an origin in tidally disrupted dwarf satellites.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231485","stars: abundances;globular clusters: general;globular clusters: individual: NGC 5286","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We find that a broad bridge feature connecting two intensity peaks, spatially correlated but separated in velocity, is a signature of a high-velocity cloud–cloud collision. We show that the broad bridge feature is resilient to the effects of radiative feedback, at least to around 2.5 Myr after the formation of the first massive (ionizing) star.

In this work, we present a two-dimensional mapping of the stellar kinematics in the inner 3.0 arcsec × 3.0 arcsec = 100 pc × 100 pc of NGC 4258 using adaptive-optics observations obtained with the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph of the Gemini North telescope at an ≈0.11 arcsec (4 pc) angular resolution. The observations resolve the radius of influence of the SMBH, revealing an abrupt increase in the stellar velocity dispersion within ≈10 pc from the nucleus, consistent with the presence of an SMBH there. Assuming that the galaxy nucleus is in a steady state and that the velocity dispersion ellipsoid is aligned with a cylindrical coordinate system, we constructed a Jeans anisotropic dynamical model to fit the observed kinematics distribution. Our dynamical model assumes that the galaxy has axial symmetry and is constructed using the multi-Gaussian expansion method to parametrize the observed surface brightness distribution. The Jeans dynamical model has three free parameters: the mass of the central SMBH (M•), the mass–luminosity ratio (Γk = M/L) of the galaxy and the anisotropy of the velocity distribution. We test two types of models: one with constant velocity anisotropy, and another with variable anisotropy. The model that best reproduces the observed kinematics was obtained considering that the galaxy has radially varying anisotropy, being the best-fitting parameters with 3σ significance $M_\bullet =4.8^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\times 10^7\,{\rm M_{\odot }}$ and $\Gamma _k = 4.1^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. This value for the mass of the SMBH is just 25 per cent larger than that of the maser determination and 50 per cent larger that a previous stellar dynamical determination obtained via Schwarzschild models for long-slit data that provides an SMBH mass 15 per cent lower than the maser value.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231495","galaxies: individual: NGC 4258;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

When this model was first developed, it was applied to radiation from Jupiter, with a magnetic field of ≈1G. Pulsars have a magnetic field of ≈1012 G. The Westfold and Legg model predict a circular polarization which is proportional to the square root of the magnetic field, and consequently predicts greater than 100 per cent circular polarization at high magnetic fields. Here a new model is derived based upon a more detailed analysis of the pitch angle distribution. This model is concerned with the frequency range $f_{B_0}/\gamma \ll f\lesssim f_{B_0}$, noting that $f_{B_0} = 2.7\times 10^7B$, which for a relatively high magnetic field (∼106–108 G) leaves emission in the optical range. This is much lower than the expected frequency peak for a mono-energetic particle of $0.29\frac{3eB}{4\pi m_{\rm e} c}\gamma ^2$. We predict the circular polarization peaks around 107G in the optical regime with the radiation almost 15 per cent circularly polarized. The linear polarization changes from about 60 to 80 per cent in the same regime. We examine implications of this for pulsar studies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231507","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;pulsars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The luminosity of Population III star clusters","A. L. DeSouza; S. Basu",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","450","1","295","304","We analyse the time evolution of the luminosity of a cluster of Population III protostars formed in the early Universe. We argue from the Jeans criterion that primordial gas can collapse to form a cluster of first stars that evolve relatively independently of one another (i.e. with negligible gravitational interaction). We model the collapse of individual protostellar clumps using non-axisymmetric numerical hydrodynamics simulations. Each collapse produces a protostar surrounded by a massive disc (i.e. Mdisc /M* ≳ 0.1), whose evolution we follow for a further 30–40 kyr. Gravitational instabilities result in the fragmentation and the formation of gravitationally bound clumps within the disc. The accretion of these fragments by the host protostar produces accretion and luminosity bursts on the order of 106 L⊙. Within the cluster, we show that a simultaneity of such events across several protostellar cluster members can elevate the cluster luminosity to 5–10 times greater than expected, and that the cluster spends ∼15 per cent of its star-forming history at these levels. This enhanced luminosity effect is particularly enabled in clusters of modest size with ≃10–20 members. In one such instance, we identify a confluence of burst events that raise the luminosity to nearly 1000 times greater than the cluster mean luminosity, resulting in L > 108 L⊙. This phenomenon arises solely through the gravitational-instability-driven episodic fragmentation and accretion that characterizes this early stage of protostellar evolution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231494","hydrodynamics;stars: formation;stars: Population III;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

SNe contribute to (and in some cases may dominate) driving turbulence in the ISM and accelerating galactic winds. Modern cosmological simulations have sufficient resolution to capture the main structures in the ISM of galaxies, but are typically still not capable of explicitly resolving all of the small-scale stellar feedback processes, including the expansion of supernova remnants (SNRs). We perform a series of controlled three-dimensional hydrodynamic (adaptive mesh refinement) simulations of single SNRs expanding in an inhomogeneous density field with statistics motivated by those of the turbulent ISM. We use these to quantify the momentum and thermal energy injection from SNe as a function of spatial scale and the density, metallicity, and structure of the ambient medium. We develop a series of analytic formulae that we fit to the simulations. These formulae can be used as a basis for a more predictive sub-resolution model for SN feedback for galaxy formation simulations. We then use simulations of multiple, stochastically driven SNe that resolve the key phases of SNRs to test the sub-resolution model, and show that it accurately captures the turbulent kinetic energy and thermal energy in the ISM. By contrast, proposed SN feedback models in the literature based on ‘delayed cooling’ significantly overpredict the late-time thermal energy and momentum in SNRs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231501","methods: numerical;ISM: supernova remnants;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: general;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The results are compared with those from control samples that are defined without regard to atomic gas content, but are matched in redshift, stellar mass and structural parameters. When compared to the control sample, the outer stellar populations of H i-rich early-type galaxies are shifted along a locus consistent with younger stellar ages, but similar metallicities. The outer colours of H i-rich late-type galaxies are much bluer in r − z than the H i-rich early types, and we infer that they have outer discs which are both younger and more metal-poor. We also analyse the environments of H i-rich galaxies within a projected radius of 500 kpc. Low-mass (log M* < 10.5) H i-rich early types are more likely to be central rather than satellite systems. Their satellites are less massive and have younger stellar populations. Similar, but weaker effects are found for low-mass H i-rich late-type galaxies.

As an example it has been argued that the discovery of the Bullet Cluster challenges standard Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model predictions. Halo catalogues from N-body simulations have been used to estimate the probability of Bullet-like clusters. However, due to simulation volume effects previous studies had to rely on a Gaussian extrapolation of the pairwise velocity distribution to high velocities. Here, we perform a detail analysis using the halo catalogues from the Dark Energy Universe Simulation Full Universe Runs (DEUS-FUR), which enables us to resolve the high-velocity tail of the distribution and study its dependence on the halo mass definition, redshift and cosmology. Building upon these results, we estimate the probability of Bullet-like systems in the framework of Extreme Value Statistics. We show that the tail of extreme pairwise velocities significantly deviates from that of a Gaussian, moreover it carries an imprint of the underlying cosmology. We find the Bullet Cluster probability to be two orders of magnitude larger than previous estimates, thus easing the tension with the ΛCDM model. Finally, the comparison of the inferred probabilities for the different DEUS-FUR cosmologies suggests that observations of extreme interacting clusters can provide constraints on dark energy models complementary to standard cosmological tests.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231499","methods: numerical;methods: statistical;galaxies: clusters: general;cosmology: theory;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Modelling the evolution of the gas fraction is clearly a necessary ingredient in the description of the hierarchical growth of clusters through mergers of subclumps and mass accretion on the one hand, and the dispersal of gas from the cluster galaxies by tidal interactions, galactic winds and ram-pressure stripping on the other hand. A reasonably complete description of this evolution can only be given by very detailed hydrodynamical simulations, which are, however, resource-intensive and difficult to implement in the mapping of parameter space. A much more practical approach is the use of semi-analytic modelling that can be easily implemented to explore a wide range of parameters. We present first results from a simple model that describes the build-up of the gas mass fraction in clusters by following the overall impact of the above processes during the merger and accretion history of each cluster in the ensemble. Acceptable ranges for model parameters are deduced through comparison with results of X-ray observations. Basic implications of our work for modelling cluster statistical properties, and the use of these properties in joint cosmological data analyses, are discussed.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231537","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The main science drivers for KMOS are the study of galaxies, star formation, and molecular clouds, but its ability to simultaneously measure spectra of multiple stars makes KMOS an interesting instrument for exoplanet atmosphere characterization via transmission spectroscopy. We set to test whether transmission spectroscopy is practical with KMOS, and what are the conditions required to achieve the photometric precision needed, based on observations of a partial transit of WASP-19b, and full transits of GJ 1214b and HD 209458b. Our analysis uses the simultaneously observed comparison stars to reduce the effects from instrumental and atmospheric sources, and Gaussian processes to model the residual systematics. We show that KMOS can, in theory, deliver the photometric precision required for transmission spectroscopy. However, this is shown to require (a) pre-imaging to ensure accurate centring and (b) a very stable night with optimal observing conditions (seeing ∼0.8 arcsec). Combining these two factors with the need to observe several transits, each with a sufficient out-of-transit baseline (and with the fact that similar or better precision can be reached with telescopes and instruments with smaller pressure), we conclude that transmission spectroscopy is not the optimal science case to take advantage of the abilities offered by KMOS and VLT.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196923","instrumentation: spectrographs;techniques: photometric;techniques: spectroscopic;planets and satellites: atmospheres","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The resulting trends show a remarkable similarity to up-to-date observations of the most metal-poor damped Lyman α absorbers at redshift z ≳ 2. These exhibit a transient nature and represent collapsing gaseous structures captured while cooling is becoming effective in lowering the temperature below ∼ 104 K, before they are disrupted by episodes of star formation or tidal effects. Our theoretical results agree with the available data for typical elemental ratios, such as [C/O], [Si/Fe], [O/Fe], [Si/O], [Fe/H], [O/H] at redshifts z ∼ 2–7. Correlations between H I and H2 abundances show temporal and local variations and large spreads as a result of the increasing cosmic star formation activity from z ∼ 6 to 3. The scatter we find in the abundance ratios is compatible with the observational data and is explained by simultaneous enrichment by sources from different stellar phases or belonging to different stellar populations. Simulated synthetic spectra support the existence of metal-poor cold clumps with large optical depth at z ∼ 6 that could be potential Population III sites at low or intermediate redshift. The expected dust content is in line with recent determinations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196904","ISM: abundances;ISM: molecules;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: ISM;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Nandi",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","453","4","3414","3427","We examine the properties of the outflowing matter from an advective accretion disc around a spinning black hole. During accretion, rotating matter experiences centrifugal pressure-supported shock transition that effectively produces a virtual barrier around the black hole in the form of post-shock corona (hereafter PSC). Due to shock compression, PSC becomes hot and dense that eventually deflects a part of the inflowing matter as bipolar outflows because of the presence of extra thermal gradient force. In our approach, we study the outflow properties in terms of the inflow parameters, namely specific energy (${\mathcal {E}}$) and specific angular momentum (λ) considering the realistic outflow geometry around the rotating black holes. We find that spin of the black hole (ak) plays an important role in deciding the outflow rate $R_{\dot{m}}$ (ratio of mass flux of outflow to inflow); in particular, $R_{\dot{m}}$ is directly correlated with ak for the same set of inflow parameters. It is found that a large range of the inflow parameters allows global accretion–ejection solutions, and the effective area of the parameter space (${\mathcal {E}}$, λ) with and without outflow decreases with black hole spin (ak). We compute the maximum outflow rate ($R^{{\rm max}}_{\dot{m}}$) as a function of black hole spin (ak) and observe that $R^{{\rm max}}_{\dot{m}}$ weakly depends on ak that lies in the range ∼10–18 per cent of the inflow rate for the adiabatic index (γ) with 1.5 ≥ γ ≥ 4/3. We present the observational implication of our approach while studying the steady/persistent jet activities based on the accretion states of black holes.

As a direct consequence, the Compton parameter Y can take large values in the blast. In the presence of decaying microturbulence and/or as a result of the Klein–Nishina suppression of inverse Compton cooling, the Y parameter carries a non-trivial dependence on the electron Lorentz factor, which modifies the spectral shape of the synchrotron and inverse Compton components. This paper provides detailed calculations of this synchrotron self-Compton spectrum in this large Y regime, accounting for the possibility of decaying microturbulence. It calculates the expected temporal and spectral indices α and β customarily defined by $F_\nu \,\propto \,t_{\rm obs}^{-\alpha }\nu ^{-\beta }$ in various spectral domains. This paper also makes predictions for the very high energy photon flux; in particular, it shows that the large Y regime would imply a detection rate of gamma-ray bursts at >10 GeV several times larger than currently anticipated.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196912","acceleration of particles;shock waves;gamma-ray burst: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We present 2D multicomponent decomposition via GALFIT, encompassing a wide range of candidate model morphologies with up to three photometric components. Particular focus is placed on early-type galaxies with outer discs (i.e. S0s), and deviations from simple (‘unbroken’) exponential discs. Rigorous filtering ensures that each model component provides a statistically significant improvement to the goodness-of-fit. The majority of Coma Cluster members in our sample (478 of 631) are reliably fitted by symmetric structural models. Of these, 134 (28 per cent) are single Sérsic objects, 143 (30 per cent) are well-described by 2-component structures, while 201 (42 per cent) require more complex models. Multicomponent Sérsic galaxies resemble compact pseudo-bulges (n ∼ 2, Re ∼ 4 kpc) surrounded by extended Gaussian-like outer structures (Re > 10 kpc). 11 per cent of galaxies (N = 52) feature a break in their outer profiles, indicating ‘truncated’ or ‘antitruncated’ discs. Beyond the break radius, truncated galaxies are structurally consistent with exponential discs, disfavouring physical truncation as their formation mechanism. Bulge luminosity in antitruncated galaxies correlates strongly with galaxy luminosity, indicating a bulge-enhancing origin for these systems. Both types of broken disc are found overwhelmingly (>70 per cent) in ‘barred’ galaxies, despite a low measured bar fraction for Coma (20 ± 2 per cent).

To avoid spiralling into the protostar due to aerodynamic drag, objects must rapidly grow from cm-sized pebbles, which are tightly coupled to the gas, to large boulders of 1–100 m in diameter. It is already well known that overdensities in the gaseous component of the disc provide potential sites for the collection of solids, and that significant density structures in the gaseous component of the disc (e.g. spiral density waves) can trap solids efficiently enough for the solid component of the disc to undergo further gravitational collapse due to their own self-gravity. In this work, we employ the PENCIL CODE to conduct local shearing sheet simulations of massive self-gravitating protoplanetary discs, to study the effect of anticyclonic transient vortices, or eddies, on the evolution of solids in these discs. We find that these types of structures are extremely efficient at concentrating small and intermediate-sized dust particles with friction times comparable to, or less than, the local orbital period of the disc. This can lead to significant over-densities in the solid component of the disc, with density enhancements comparable to, and even higher, than those within spiral density waves; increasing the rate of gravitational collapse of solids into bound structures.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196906","accretion, accretion discs;gravitation;hydrodynamics;instabilities;planets and satellites: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The spectrum is well described by two continuum components (absorbed and unabsorbed). The resulting spectral parameters are modulated with orbital phase. During low state, a significant component of the flux, and its spectrum, is consistent with X-ray reflection off the face of the companion star HZ Her. This component has a significantly harder X-ray spectrum than the rest of the flux from the Her X-1 system. A second component in low state is consistent with emission from the accretion disc corona. During short high, a third strong component is present with a softer spectrum, which is associated with the neutron star and accretion disc. Due to this direct emission from the neutron star and accretion disc, the reflected emission is less clear; however, parameters and fluxes modulations during short high state indicate its presence. In low state, the hard X-ray flux (hν > 10 keV) peaks at orbital phase ϕorb ≃ 0.55, which is expected from a simple model of atmospheric reflection from the companion star.

When combined with archival X-ray measurements, our radio detection places 47 Tuc X9 very close to the radio/X-ray correlation for accreting black holes, and we explore the possibility that this source is instead a quiescent stellar-mass black hole X-ray binary. The nature of the donor star is uncertain; although the luminosity of the optical counterpart is consistent with a low-mass main-sequence donor star, the mass transfer rate required to produce the high quiescent X-ray luminosity of 1033 erg s−1 suggests the system may instead be ultracompact, with an orbital period of order 25 min. This is the fourth quiescent black hole candidate discovered to date in a Galactic globular cluster, and the only one with a confirmed accretion signature from its optical/ultraviolet spectrum.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196936","stars: black holes;globular clusters: individual: 47 Tuc;radio continuum: general;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For the first time, we map out multiple physical parameters, such as the temperature (kT), electron density (ne), ionization parameter (net), ionization age (tion), metal abundances, as well as the radio-to-X-ray slope (α) and cutoff frequency (νcutoff) of the synchrotron emission. We construct probability distribution functions of kT and net, and model them with several Gaussians, in order to characterize the average thermal and ionization states of such an extended source. We construct equivalent width (EW) maps based on continuum interpolation with the spectral model of each region. We then compare the EW maps of O VII, O VIII, O VII Kδ − ζ, Ne, Mg, Si XIII, Si XIV, and S lines constructed with this method to those constructed with linear interpolation. We further extract spectra from larger regions to confirm the features revealed by parameter and EW maps, which are often not directly detectable on X-ray intensity images. For example, O abundance is consistent with solar across the SNR, except for a low-abundance hole in the centre. This ‘O hole' has enhanced O VII Kδ − ζ and Fe emissions, indicating recently reverse shocked ejecta, but also has the highest net, indicating forward shocked interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, a multitemperature model is needed to decompose these components. The asymmetric metal distributions suggest there is either an asymmetric explosion of the supernova or an asymmetric distribution of the ISM.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196942","acceleration of particles;shock waves;methods: data analysis;cosmic rays;ISM: supernova remnants;X-rays: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

They must have lost most of the angular momentum initially contained in the parental cloud, the so-called angular momentum problem. We investigate here a new mechanism by which large amounts of angular momentum might be shed from young stellar systems, thus yielding slowly rotating young stars. Assuming that planets promptly form in circumstellar discs and rapidly migrate close to the central star, we investigate how the tidal and magnetic interactions between the protostar, its close-in planet(s), and the inner circumstellar disc can efficiently remove angular momentum from the central object. We find that neither the tidal torque nor the variety of magnetic torques acting between the star and the embedded planet are able to counteract the spin-up torques due to accretion and contraction. Indeed, the former are orders of magnitude weaker than the latter beyond the corotation radius and are thus unable to prevent the young star from spinning up. We conclude that star–planet interaction in the early phases of stellar evolution does not appear as a viable alternative to magnetic star–disc coupling to understand the origin of the low angular momentum content of young stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196917","accretion, accretion discs;MHD;planet–disc interactions;planet–star interactions;stars: formation;stars: rotation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We identify 25 surviving LMC-mass subhaloes, and investigate the lower-mass satellites that were associated with these subhaloes before they fell into the MW/M31 haloes. Typically, 7 per cent of the overall z = 0 satellite population of MW/M31 haloes were in a surviving LMC-group before falling into the MW/M31 halo. This fraction can vary between 1 and 25 per cent, being higher for groups with higher mass and/or more recent infall times. Groups of satellites disperse rapidly in phase space after infall, and their distances and velocities relative to the group centre become statistically similar to the overall satellite population after 4–8 Gyr. We quantify the likelihood that satellites were associated with an LMC-mass group as a function of both distance and velocity relative to the LMC at z = 0. The close proximity in distance of the nine Dark Energy Survey candidate dwarf galaxies to the LMC suggest that ∼2–4 are likely associated with the LMC. Furthermore, if several of these dwarfs are genuine members, then the LMC-group probably fell into the MW very recently, ≲2 Gyr ago. If the connection with the LMC is established with follow-up velocity measurements, these ‘satellites of satellites’ represent prime candidates to study the effects of group pre-processing on lower mass dwarfs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196966","Galaxy: formation;Galaxy: halo;galaxies: dwarf;Magellanic Clouds","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We explore the impact of these new recipes on the evolution of fundamental galaxy properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas and stellar phase metallicity. We present predictions for stellar mass functions, stellar mass versus SFR relations, and cold gas phase and stellar mass–metallicity relations for our fiducial models, from redshift z ∼ 6 to the present day. In addition we present predictions for the global SFR, mass assembly history, and cosmic enrichment history. We find that the predicted stellar properties of galaxies (stellar mass, SFR, metallicity) are remarkably insensitive to the details of the recipes used for partitioning gas into H I and H2. We see significant sensitivity to the recipes for H2 formation only in very low mass haloes ($M_{\rm h} \lesssim 10^{10.5}\, {{\rm M}_{{\odot }}}$), which host galaxies with stellar masses $m_* \lesssim 10^8\, {{\rm M}_{{\odot }}}$. The properties of low-mass galaxies are also quite insensitive to the details of the recipe used for converting H2 into stars, while the formation epoch of massive galaxies does depend on this significantly. We argue that this behaviour can be interpreted within the framework of a simple equilibrium model for galaxy evolution, in which the conversion of cold gas into stars is balanced on average by inflows and outflows.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196941","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This is longer than the typical eclipsing binary period found by Kepler, and hence there is a dearth of planets around the closest binaries. In this paper, we suggest how this dearth may be explained by the presence of a distant stellar tertiary companion, which shrunk the inner binary orbit by the process of Kozai cycles and tidal friction, a mechanism that has been implicated for producing most binaries with periods below 7 d. We show that the geometry and orbital dynamics of these evolving triple star systems are highly restrictive for a circumbinary planet, which is subject itself to Kozai modulation, on one hand, and can shield the two inner stars from their Kozai cycle and subsequent shrinking, on the other hand. Only small planets on wide and inclined orbits may form, survive and allow for the inner binary shrinkage.

The model accurately reproduces the average subhalo mass and velocity functions, as well as their halo-to-halo variance, in N-body simulations. We construct thousands of realizations of Milky Way (MW)-size host haloes, allowing us to investigate the TBTF problem with unprecedented statistical power. We examine the dependence on host halo mass and cosmology, and explicitly demonstrate that a reliable assessment of TBTF requires large samples of hundreds of host haloes. We argue that previous statistics used to address TBTF suffer from the look-elsewhere effect and/or disregard certain aspects of the data on the MW satellite population. We devise a new statistic that is not hampered by these shortcomings, and, using only data on the nine known MW satellite galaxies with Vmax > 15 km s−1, demonstrate that $1.4^{+3.3}_{-1.1}$ per cent of MW-size host haloes have a subhalo population in statistical agreement with that of the MW. However, when using data on the MW satellite galaxies down to Vmax = 8 km s−1, this MW consistent fraction plummets to <5 × 10−4 (at 68 per cent confidence level). Hence, if it turns out that the inventory of MW satellite galaxies is complete down to 8 km s−1, then the maximum circular velocities of MW satellites are utterly inconsistent with Λ cold dark matter predictions, unless baryonic effects can drastically increase the spread in Vmax values of satellite galaxies compared to that of their subhaloes.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196938","methods: analytical;methods: statistical;Galaxy: halo;galaxies: haloes;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here we show that this low value leaves essentially no room for an early partial reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) by high-redshift Population III (Pop III) stars, expected to have formed in low-mass minihaloes. We perform semi-analytic calculations of reionization which include the contribution from Pop II stars in atomic cooling haloes, calibrated with high-redshift galaxy observations, and Pop III stars in minihaloes with feedback due to Lyman–Werner (LW) radiation and metal enrichment. We find that without LW feedback or prompt metal enrichment (and assuming a minihalo escape fraction of 0.5) the Pop III star formation efficiency cannot exceed ∼a few × 10−4, without violating the constraints set by Planck data. This excludes massive Pop III star formation in typical 106 M⊙ minihaloes. Including LW feedback and metal enrichment alleviates this tension, allowing large Pop III stars to form early on before they are quenched by feedback. We find that the total density of Pop III stars formed across cosmic time is ≲104–5 M⊙ Mpc−3 and does not depend strongly on the feedback prescription adopted. Additionally, we perform a simple estimate of the possible impact on reionization of X-rays produced by accretion on to black hole remnants of Pop III stars. We find that unless the accretion duty cycle is very low (≲0.01), this could lead to an optical depth inconsistent with Planck.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196968","stars: Population III;galaxies: high-redshift;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The power density spectrum of the optical flare light curves is dominated by a red-noise component, typical of aperiodic activity in X-ray binaries. Simultaneous X-ray and UV observations by the Swift satellite reveal strong correlations that are consistent with X-ray reprocessing of the UV light, most likely in the outer regions of the accretion disc. On some nights we also observe sharp-edged, rectangular, flat-bottomed dips randomly distributed in orbital phase, with a median duration of ∼250 s and a median ingress/egress time of ∼20 s. These rectangular dips are similar to the mode-switching behaviour between disc ‘active’ and ‘passive’ luminosity states, observed in the X-ray light curves of other redback millisecond pulsars. This is the first time that the optical analogue of the X-ray mode-switching has been observed. The properties of the passive- and active-state light curves can be explained in terms of clumpy accretion from a trapped inner accretion disc near the corotation radius, resulting in rectangular, flat-bottomed optical and X-ray light curves.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196900","binaries: close;stars: fundamental parameters;stars: individual: PSR J1023+0038;stars: neutron;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The Grand Tack model invokes a specific migration history of the giant planets to remove most of the mass initially beyond 1 au and to dynamically excite the asteroid belt. However, one could also invoke a steep density gradient created by inward drift and pile-up of small particles induced by gas drag, as has been proposed to explain the formation of close-in super-Earths. Here we show that the asteroid belt's orbital excitation provides a crucial constraint against this scenario for the Solar system. We performed a series of simulations of terrestrial planet formation and asteroid belt evolution starting from discs of planetesimals and planetary embryos with various radial density gradients and including Jupiter and Saturn on nearly circular and coplanar orbits. Discs with shallow density gradients reproduce the dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt by gravitational self-stirring but form Mars analogues significantly more massive than the real planet. In contrast, a disc with a surface density gradient proportional to r−5.5 reproduces the Earth/Mars mass ratio but leaves the asteroid belt in a dynamical state that is far colder than the real belt. We conclude that no disc profile can simultaneously explain the structure of the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt. The asteroid belt must have been depleted and dynamically excited by a different mechanism such as, for instance, in the Grand Tack scenario.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196920","methods: numerical;planets and satellites: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The observed power spectrum is flatter than these expectations, and the surface brightness fluctuations are around the 8 per cent level on length-scales of 2 kpc. We convert the 2D power spectrum of fluctuations into a 3D power spectrum using the method of Churazov et al., and then convert this into constraints on the one-component velocity of the gas motions as a function of their length-scale. We find one-component velocities in the range 100–150 km s−1 on spatial scales of 4–10 kpc. An independent constraint on the characteristic velocity and length-scales of the gas motions is then found by considering the diffusion coefficient needed to explain the distribution of metals in the Centaurus cluster, combined with the need to balance the rate of gas cooling with the rate of heat dissipated by the gas motions.

We have matched this sample to a range of multi-wavelength catalogues, including Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey, Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic survey, United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Infrared Deep Sky Survey and optical data; multi-wavelength counterparts are found for 80 of the 96 sources and spectroscopic redshifts are available for 24 sources. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the sources with multi-wavelength data available; the median redshift of the sample is 0.91 with an interquartile range of 0.84. Radio-to-optical ratios show that at least 94 per cent of the sample are radio loud, indicating that the 10C sample is dominated by radio galaxies. This is in contrast to samples selected at lower frequencies, where radio-quiet AGN and star-forming galaxies are present in significant numbers at these flux density levels. All six radio-quiet sources have rising radio spectra, suggesting that they are dominated by AGN emission. These results confirm the conclusions of Paper I that the faint, flat-spectrum sources which are found to dominate the 10C sample below ∼1 mJy are the cores of radio galaxies. The properties of the 10C sample are compared to the Square Kilometre Array Design Studies Simulated Skies; a population of low-redshift star-forming galaxies predicted by the simulation is not found in the observed sample.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196946","catalogues;surveys;galaxies: active;radio continuum: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To identify such a population, we match the quasar catalogues of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to identify quasars with extremely high infrared-to-optical ratios. We identify 65 objects with rAB − W4Vega > 14 mag (i.e. Fν(22 μm)/Fν(r) ≳ 1000). This sample spans a redshift range of 0.28 < z < 4.36 and has a bimodal distribution, with peaks at z ∼ 0.8 and z ∼ 2.5. It includes three z > 2.6 objects that are detected in the W4 band but not W1 or W2 (i.e. ‘W1W2 dropouts'). The SDSS/BOSS spectra show that the majority of the objects are reddened type 1 quasars, type 2 quasars (both at low and high redshift) or objects with deep low-ionization broad absorption lines (BALs) that suppress the observed r-band flux. In addition, we identify a class of type 1 permitted broad emission-line objects at z ≃ 2–3 which are characterized by emission line rest-frame equivalent widths (REWs) of ≳150 Å, much larger than those of typical quasars. In particular, 55 per cent (45 per cent) of the non-BAL type 1s with measurable C IV in our sample have REW(C IV) > 100 (150) Å, compared to only 5.8 per cent (1.3 per cent) for non-BAL quasars in BOSS. These objects often also have unusual line ratios, such as very high N V/Ly α ratios. These large REWs might be caused by suppressed continuum emission analogous to type 2 quasars; however, there is no obvious mechanism in standard unified models to suppress the continuum without also obscuring the broad emission lines.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196903","surveys;galaxies: evolution;quasars: general;infrared: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

With the advent of all-sky surveys, thousands of eclipsing binaries have been reported, yet their light curves are not fully exploited. The goal of this work is to make use of the eclipsing binary light curves delivered by all-sky surveys. We attempt to extract physical parameters of the binary systems from their light curves and colour. Inspired by the work of Devor et al., we use the Detached Eclipsing Binary Light curve fitter (DEBIL) and the Method for Eclipsing Component Identification (MECI) to derive basic properties of the binary systems reported by the All Sky Automated Survey, the Northern Sky Variability Survey, and the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroids Research. We derive the mass, fractional radius, and age for 783 binary systems. We report a subsample of eccentric systems and compare their properties to the tidal circularization theory. With MECI, we are able to estimate the distance of the eclipsing binary systems and use them to probe the structure of the Milky Way. Following the approach of Devor et al., we demonstrate that DEBIL and MECI are instrumental to investigate eclipsing binary light curves in the era of all-sky surveys, and provide estimates of stellar parameters of both binary components without spectroscopic information.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196909","Binaries: eclipsing","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The simulations incorporate detailed models of the sky, telescope and instrument to produce realistic mock data. Further, we employ a new method of incorporating the strongly wavelength-dependent adaptive optics point spread functions. HSIM provides a step beyond traditional exposure time calculators and allows us to both predict the feasibility of a given observing programme with HARMONI and perform instrument design trade-offs.

"Interpreting the possible break in the black hole–bulge mass relation","F. Fontanot; P. Monaco; F. Shankar",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","453","4","4112","4120","Recent inspections of local available data suggest that the almost linear relation between the stellar mass of spheroids (Msph) and the mass of the super massive black holes (BHs), residing at their centres, shows a break below Msph ∼ 1010 M⊙, with a steeper, about quadratic relation at smaller masses. We investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for the change in slope of this relation, by comparing data with the results of the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation MORGANA, which already predicted such a break in its original formulation. We find that the change of slope is mostly induced by effective stellar feedback in star-forming bulges. The shape of the relation is instead quite insensitive to other physical mechanisms connected to BH accretion such as disc instabilities, galaxy mergers, active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, or even the exact modelling of accretion on to the BH, direct or through a reservoir of low angular momentum gas. Our results support a scenario where most stars form in the disc component of galaxies and are carried to bulges through mergers and disc instabilities, while accretion on to BHs is connected to star formation in the spheroidal component. Therefore, a model of stellar feedback that produces stronger outflows in star-forming bulges than in discs will naturally produce a break in the scaling relation. Our results point to a form of co-evolution especially at lower masses, below the putative break, mainly driven by stellar feedback rather than AGN feedback.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196961","galaxies: active;galaxies: bulges;galaxies: evolution","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We measure radial velocities of the object and its approximate spectral type by cross-correlating our spectra with those of known red supergiants. Our VLT/X-shooter spectrum is best matched by that of early M-type supergiants, confirming the red supergiant nature of the candidate counterpart. The radial velocity of the spectrum, taken on 2014 August 23, is 417 ± 4 km s−1. This is consistent with the radial velocity measured in our spectrum taken with Magellan/MMIRS on 2013 June 28, of 410 ± 70 km s−1, although the large error on the latter implies that a radial velocity shift expected for a black hole of tens of M⊙ can easily be hidden. Using nebular emission lines we find that the radial velocity due to the rotation of NGC 253 is 351 ± 4 km s−1 at the position of the ULX. Thus the radial velocity of the counterpart confirms that the source is located in NGC 253, but also shows an offset with respect to the local bulk motion of the galaxy of 66 ± 6 km s−1. We argue that the most likely origin for this displacement lies either in a SN kick, requiring a system containing a ≳ 50 M⊙ black hole, and/or in orbital radial velocity variations in the ULX binary system, requiring a ≳ 100 M⊙ black hole. We therefore conclude that RX J004722.4–252051 is a strong candidate for a ULX containing a massive stellar black hole.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196927","supergiants;infrared: stars;X-rays: binaries;X-rays: individual: RX J004722.4-252051","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By means of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations we consider the late stages of a gas-rich major merger, detailing the dynamics of two circumnuclear discs, and of the hosted massive black holes during their pairing phase. During the merger gas clumps with masses of a fraction of the black hole mass form because of fragmentation. Such high-density gas is very effective in forming stars, and the most massive clumps can substantially perturb the black hole orbits. After ∼10 Myr from the start of the merger a gravitationally bound black hole binary forms at a separation of a few parsecs, and soon after, the separation falls below our resolution limit of 0.39 pc. At the time of binary formation the original discs are almost completely disrupted because of SNa feedback, while on pc scales the residual gas settles in a circumbinary disc with mass ∼ 105  M⊙. We also test that binary dynamics is robust against the details of the SNa feedback employed in the simulations, while gas dynamics is not.

We use a smooth source function formalizm to obtain non-local, integral expressions for the direct and diffuse components of the line-force that account for deviations from the usual localized, Sobolev forms. As the scattering source function is reduced, we find the solution topology in the transonic region transitions from X-type, with a unique wind solution, to a nodal type, characterized by a degenerate family of solutions. Specifically, in the idealized case of an optically thin source function and a uniformly bright stellar disc, the unique X-type solution proves to be a stable attractor to which time-dependent numerical radiation-hydrodynamical simulations relax. But in models where the scattering strength is only modestly reduced, the topology instead turns nodal, with the associated solution degeneracy now manifest by intrinsic structure and variability that persist down to the photospheric wind base. This highlights the potentially crucial role of diffuse radiation for the dynamics and variability of line-driven winds, and seriously challenges the use of Sobolev theory in the transonic wind region. Since such Sobolev-based models are commonly used in broad applications like stellar evolution and feedback, this prompts development of new wind models, not only for further quantifying the intrinsic variability found here, but also for computing new theoretical predictions of global properties like velocity laws and mass-loss rates.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196929","hydrodynamics;instabilities;radiation: dynamics;stars: early-type;stars: mass-loss;stars: winds, outflows","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We identify cosmological voids with radii of 2–12 h−1 Mpc in a large N-body simulation at z = 2.5, and characterize the signal of the high-redshift voids in density and Lyα forest flux. The void properties are similar to what has been found at lower redshifts, but they are smaller and have steeper radial density profiles. Similarly to what has been found for low-redshift voids, the radial velocity profiles have little scatter and agree very well with the linear theory prediction. We run the same void finder on an ideal Lyα flux field and tomographic reconstructions at various spatial samplings. We compare the tomographic map void catalogues to the density void catalogue and find good agreement even with modest-sized voids (r > 6 h−1 Mpc). Using our simple void-finding method, the configuration of the ongoing COSMOS Lyman Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey covering 1 deg2 would provide a sample of about 100 high-redshift voids.

We examine these effects within a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic galactic outflow model that reproduces basic observed trends of H I in galaxies. We show that this model reproduces the observed H I mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the H I richness ($M_{\rm H\,\small {I}}$/M*) versus local galaxy density. For satellite galaxies in massive ( ≳ 1012 M⊙) haloes, the H I richness distribution is bimodal and the median drops towards the largest halo masses. The depletion time-scale of H I entering a massive halo is more rapid, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows little variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. This suggests that, up to the halo mass scales probed here ( ≲ 1014 M⊙), star formation is mainly attenuated by starvation, but H I is additionally removed by stripping once a hot gaseous halo is present. In low-mass haloes, the H I richness of satellites is independent of radius, while in very massive haloes they become gas-poor towards the centre, confirming the increasing strength of the stripping with halo mass. Mergers somewhat increase the H I richness and its scatter about the mean relation, tracking the metallicity in a way consistent with it arising from inflow fluctuations, while star formation is significantly boosted relative to H I.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196963","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By computing the mass of the cores and comparing it to the Bonnor–Ebert mass, we determined that 29 of the 34 cores are gravitationally unstable and undergoing collapse. In fact, we found that six cores are associated with at least one young stellar object, suggestive of their protostellar nature. By investigating the physical conditions within each core, we can shed light on the cm emission revealed (or not) by our CARMA observations. Indeed, we find that only three of our cores have any significant detectable cm emission. Using a spinning dust model, we predict the expected level of spinning dust emission in each core and find that for all 34 cores, the predicted level of emission is larger than the observed cm emission constrained by the CARMA observations. Moreover, even in the cores for which we do detect cm emission, we cannot, at this stage, discriminate between free–free emission from young stellar objects and spinning dust emission.

We conclude that the dominant factor determining the fragmentation level of star-forming massive dense cores at 0.1 pc scale seems to be thermal Jeans fragmentation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196919","turbulence;stars: formation;ISM: lines and bands;ISM: structure;radio continuum: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies: the influence of morphology, stellar mass and environment","D. Zhao; A. Aragón-Salamanca; C. J. Conselice",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","453","4","4444","4455","Using a sample of 425 nearby brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) from von der Linden et al., we study the relationship between their internal properties (stellar masses, structural parameters and morphologies) and their environment. More massive BCGs tend to inhabit denser regions and more massive clusters than lower mass BCGs. Furthermore, cDs, which are BCGs with particularly extended envelopes, seem to prefer marginally denser regions and tend to be hosted by more massive haloes than elliptical BCGs. cD and elliptical BCGs show parallel positive correlations between their stellar masses and environmental densities. However, at a fixed environmental density, cDs are, on average, ∼40 per cent more massive. Our results, together with the findings of previous studies, suggest an evolutionary link between elliptical and cD BCGs. We suggest that most present-day cDs started their life as ellipticals, which subsequently grew in stellar mass and size due to mergers. In this process, the cD envelope developed. The large scatter in the stellar masses and sizes of the cDs reflects their different merger histories. The growth of the BCGs in mass and size seems to be linked to the hierarchical growth of the structures they inhabit: as the groups and clusters became denser and more massive, the BCGs at their centres also grew. This process is nearing completion since the majority (∼60 per cent) of the BCGs in the local Universe have cD morphology. However, the presence of galaxies with intermediate morphological classes (between ellipticals and cDs) suggests that the growth and morphological transformation of some BCGs is still ongoing.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196967","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We confirm cluster membership for one Virgo dE, and group membership for one dE in the NGC 1023 group, and one dE in the NGC 1407 group for the first time. Regardless of environment, the dEs follow the same size–magnitude and σ–luminosity relation.

Given their small sizes (Re < 300 pc) and large central velocity dispersions, we classify these two dwarfs as compact ellipticals (cEs) rather than dEs. Group dEs typically have higher mean dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios than the cluster dEs, with Mdyn/M⋆ = 5.1 ± 0.6 for the group dwarfs, versus Mdyn/M⋆ = 2.2 ± 0.5 for the cluster sample, which includes two cEs.

The algorithm solves the evolution equations of the zeroth- and first-order angular moments of the specific intensity, supplemented by an algebraic relation for the second-moment tensor to close the system. The scheme takes into account frame-dependent effects of the order $\mathcal {O}(v/c)$ as well as the most important types of neutrino interactions. The transport scheme is significantly more efficient than a multidimensional solver of the Boltzmann equation, while it is more accurate and consistent than the flux-limited diffusion method. The finite-volume discretization of the essentially hyperbolic system of moment equations employs methods well-known from hydrodynamics. For the time integration of the potentially stiff moment equations we employ a scheme in which only the local source terms are treated implicitly, while the advection terms are kept explicit, thereby allowing for an efficient computational parallelization of the algorithm. We investigate various problem set-ups in one and two dimensions to verify the implementation and to test the quality of the algebraic closure scheme. In our most detailed test, we compare a fully dynamic, one-dimensional core-collapse simulation with two published calculations performed with well-known Boltzmann-type neutrino-hydrodynamics codes and we find very satisfactory agreement.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196944","hydrodynamics;neutrinos;radiative transfer;methods: numerical;stars: neutron;supernovae: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We assume that emission is given by the general triaxial non-aligned model of Jones, whosewaveform under certain conditions reduces to that of a biaxial precessing star, or a simple rigidly rotating triaxial aligned star. The triaxial non-aligned and biaxial models can produce emission at both the star's rotation frequency (f) and 2f, whilst the latter only emits at 2f. We have studied parameter estimation for signal models using both a set of physical source parameters and a set of waveform parameters that remove a degeneracy. We have assessed the signal detection efficiency, and used Bayesian model selection to investigate how well we can distinguish between the three models. We found that for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ≳6, there is no significant loss in efficiency if performing a search for a signal at f and 2f when the source is only producing emission at 2f. However, for sources with emission at both f and 2f, signals could be missed by a search only at 2f. We also find that for a triaxial aligned source, the correct model is always favoured, but for a triaxial non-aligned source it can be hard to distinguish between the triaxial non-aligned model and the biaxial model, even at high SNR. Finally, we apply the method to a selection of known pulsars using data from the LIGO fifth science run. We give the first upper limits on gravitational wave amplitude at both f and 2f and apply the model selection criteria on real data.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196962","gravitational waves;methods: data analysis;methods: statistical;stars: neutron;pulsars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These features are made possible by the high mass loadings generated by the evaporative growth of superbubbles. Outflows are driven extremely effectively at high redshift, expelling gas at early times and preventing overproduction of stars before z = 2. Centrally concentrated gas in previous simulations has often lead to unrealistically high bulge to total ratios and strongly peaked rotation curves.

Previous observations were limited by resolution meaning that the radio emission could not be compared with current generation high-resolution infrared data from Herschel, Spitzer or Wide-field Infrared Sky Explorer. This paper presents arcminute resolution mapping observations of LDN 1622 at 4.85 and 13.7 GHz using the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. The 4.85 GHz map reveals a corona of free–free emission enclosing LDN 1622 that traces the photodissociation region of the cloud. The brightest peaks of the 4.85 GHz map are found to be within ≈10 per cent agreement with the expected free–free predicted by Southern H-Alpha Sky Survey Atlas H α data of LDN 1622. At 13.7 GHz, the AME flux density was found to be 7.0 ± 1.4 mJy and evidence is presented for a rising spectrum between 13.7 and 31 GHz. The spinning dust model of AME is found to naturally account for the flux seen at 13.7 GHz. Correlations between the diffuse 13.7 GHz emission and the diffuse mid-infrared emission are used to further demonstrate that the emission originating from LDN 1622 at 13.7 GHz is described by the spinning dust model.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196933","radiation mechanisms: general;dust, extinction;diffuse radiation;ISM: individual objects: LDN 1622;photodissociation region (PDR);radio continuum: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Data from the ℓ = 30° survey region, which contains the massive-star-forming regions W43 and G29.96, are analysed after approximately 40 per cent of the observations had been completed. The pixel-to-pixel noise is found to be 19 mJy beam−1 after a smooth over the beam area, and the projected equivalent noise levels in the final survey are expected to be around 10 mJy beam−1.

The completeness limits in these data are estimated to be around 0.2 Jy beam−1 (peak flux density) and 0.8 Jy (integrated flux density) and are therefore probably already dominated by source confusion in this relatively crowded section of the survey. The flux densities of extracted compact sources are consistent with those of matching detections in the shallower APEX (Atacama Pathfinder Experiment) Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL) survey.

In particular, we investigate 27 Kepler systems having planets within 6 per cent of the 2:1 MMR, and find that the initial eccentricities required to explain the observed spacings are unreasonable from simple dynamical arguments. Furthermore, our numerical simulations reveal resonant tugging, an effect which conspires against the migration of resonant planets away from the 2:1 MMR, requiring even higher initial eccentricities in order to explain the current Kepler distribution. Overall, we find that tides alone cannot explain planets close to 2:1 MMR, and additional mechanisms are required to explain these systems.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196957","planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;planets and satellites: formation;planets and satellites: general;planets and satellites: physical evolution","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Most of them steadily spin-down and display a highly repetitive pulse shape. But some pulsars experience timing irregularities such as nulling, intermittency, mode changing and timing noise. As changes in the pulse shape are often correlated with timing irregularities, precession is a possible cause of these phenomena. Whereas pulsar magnetospheres are filled with plasma, most pulsar precession studies were carried out within the vacuum approximation and neglected the effects of magnetospheric currents and charges. Recent numerical simulations of plasma-filled pulsar magnetospheres provide us with a detailed quantitative description of magnetospheric torques exerted on the pulsar surface. In this paper, we present the study of neutron star evolution using these new torque expressions. We show that they lead to (1) much slower long-term evolution of pulsar parameters and (2) much less extreme solutions for these parameters than the vacuum magnetosphere models. To facilitate the interpretation of observed pulsar timing residuals, we derive an analytic model that (1) describes the time evolution of non-spherical pulsars and (2) translates the observed pulsar timing residuals into the geometrical parameters of the pulsar. We apply this model to two pulsars with very different temporal behaviours. For the pulsar B1828-11, we demonstrate that the timing residual curves allow two pulsar geometries: one with stellar deformation pointing along the magnetic axis and one along the rotational axis. For the Crab pulsar, we use the model show that the recent observation of its magnetic and rotational axes moving away from each other can be explained by precession.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196916","stars: magnetic field;stars: neutron;pulsars: general;stars: rotation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The light-curve analysis shows a significant count rate variation (about a factor of 2–3) on a time-scale of a few days, while the X-ray colours show a change in the spectral curvature below 2 keV and the presence of two main spectral states. From the spectral analysis we find that the observed variations can be explained by the change of the intrinsic nuclear power (about a factor of 1.5) coupled with a change of the properties of an ionized absorber. The quality of the data prevents us from firmly establishing if the spectral variation is due to a change in the ionization state and/or in the covering factor of the absorbing medium. The latter scenario would imply a clumpy structure of the ionized medium. By combining the information provided by the light curve and the spectral analyses, we can derive some constraints on the location of the absorber under the hypotheses of either homogeneous or clumpy medium. In both cases, we find that the absorber should be located inside the outer edge of an extended torus and, in particular, under the clumpy hypothesis, it should be located near, or just outside, to the broad emission line region.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196926","galaxies: active;galaxies: individual: Mrk 915;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We run two sets of MHD simulations: one including adiabatic gas physics only; the other featuring the fiducial feedback model of the Illustris simulation. In the adiabatic case, the magnetic field amplification follows the B ∝ ρ2/3 scaling derived from ‘flux-freezing' arguments, with the seed field strength providing an overall normalization factor. At high baryon overdensities the amplification is enhanced by shear flows and turbulence. Feedback physics and the inclusion of radiative cooling change this picture dramatically. In haloes, gas collapses to much larger densities and the magnetic field is amplified strongly and to the same maximum intensity irrespective of the initial seed field of which any memory is lost. At lower densities a dependence on the seed field strength and orientation, which in principle can be used to constrain models of cosmic magnetogenesis, is still present. Inside the most massive haloes magnetic fields reach values of ∼ 10-100 μG, in agreement with galaxy cluster observations. The topology of the field is tangled and gives rise to rotation measure signals in reasonable agreement with the observations. However, the rotation measure signal declines too rapidly towards larger radii as compared to observational data.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196901","magnetic fields;MHD;methods: numerical;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We show that the spectral effects of these three (IMF slope, LMCO, AGB strength) are subtle compared to age–abundance effects.

It is therefore important to continuously advance the numerical methods implemented in current astrophysical codes, especially also in light of evolving computer technology, which favours certain computational approaches over others. Here we introduce the new adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code TENET, which employs a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for hydrodynamics. The Euler equations in this method are solved in a weak formulation with a polynomial basis by means of explicit Runge–Kutta time integration and Gauss–Legendre quadrature. This approach offers significant advantages over commonly employed second-order finite-volume (FV) solvers. In particular, the higher order capability renders it computationally more efficient, in the sense that the same precision can be obtained at significantly less computational cost. Also, the DG scheme inherently conserves angular momentum in regions where no limiting takes place, and it typically produces much smaller numerical diffusion and advection errors than an FV approach. A further advantage lies in a more natural handling of AMR refinement boundaries, where a fall-back to first order can be avoided. Finally, DG requires no wide stencils at high order, and offers an improved data locality and a focus on local computations, which is favourable for current and upcoming highly parallel supercomputers. We describe the formulation and implementation details of our new code, and demonstrate its performance and accuracy with a set of two- and three-dimensional test problems. The results confirm that DG schemes have a high potential for astrophysical applications.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196930","hydrodynamics;methods: numerical","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

From the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of SN 2009ip until 820 d after the start of the 2012a event, we still see no conclusive evidence for core-collapse, although whether any such signs could be masked by ongoing interaction is unclear.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196954","stars: massive;stars: mass loss;supernovae: general;supernovae: individual: (SN2009ip)","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Low-significance (∼95 per cent confidence) correlations with the UV leading the X-ray variations are observed. The lack of a significant correlation between the UV and X-ray bands seems consistent with the X-ray source being centrally compact and dominated by light bending close to the black hole.

We report the discovery of a radio relic + radio halo system in PSZ1 G108.18-11.53 (z = 0.335). This cluster hosts the second most powerful double radio relic system ever discovered. We observed PSZ1 G108.18-11.53 with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. We obtained radio maps at 147, 323, 607 and 1380 MHz. We also observed the cluster with the Keck telescope, obtaining the spectroscopic redshift for 42 cluster members. From the injection index, we obtained the Mach number of the shocks generating the two radio relics. For the southern shock, we found $\mathcal {M}= 2.33^{+0.19}_{-0.26}$, while the northern shock Mach number goes from $\mathcal {M}= 2.20^{+0.07}_{-0.14}$ in the north part down to $\mathcal {M}= 2.00^{+0.03}_{-0.08}$ in the southern region. If the relation between the injection index and the Mach number predicted by diffusive shock acceleration theory holds, this is the first observational evidence for a gradient in the Mach number along a galaxy cluster merger shock.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196939","galaxies: clusters: individual: PSZ1 G108.18-11.53;large-scale structure of Universe;radio continuum: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The detection rate of H2O masers is correlated with continuum emission fluxes of BGPS sources at far-infrared, sub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. We employed the classification of Dunham et al. to classify the evolutionary stage of BGPS sources into Group 0, 1, 2, and 3. The detection rate and velocity range of H2O masers increases as the BGPS sources evolve from Group 1 to Group 3. The BGPS sources associated with both H2O and CH3OH masers are more compact than that associated with either only H2O or only CH3OH masers. This indicates that the sources associated with both H2O and CH3OH masers are in relative later evolutionary stage. The detection rate of H2O masers towards BGPS sources displaying evidence of the collapse phenomenon is 62.1 per cent, which suggests that most BGPS sources showing indications of collapse phenomena contain ongoing active star formation activities.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196964","masers;stars: formation;ISM: molecules;radio lines: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

First, LDTK can be used to compute custom LD profiles with uncertainties propagated from the uncertainties in the stellar parameter estimates. Secondly, LDTK can be used to estimate the LD-model-specific coefficients with uncertainties for the most common LD models. Thirdly, LDTK can be directly integrated into the log posterior computation of any pre-existing modelling code with minimal modifications. The last approach can be used to constrain the LD model parameter space directly by the LD profile, allowing for the marginalization over the LD parameter space without the need to approximate the constraint from the LD profile using a prior.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196928","gravitational lensing: micro;methods: numerical;techniques: interferometric;planets and satellites: general;binaries: eclipsing","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is therefore interesting to explore alternatives to the simplest scenario, in particular by assuming a more general framework where the fluid responsible for the accelerated expansion is characterized by a time-dependent equation of state. Usually these models, dubbed dark energy models, are purely phenomenological, but in this work we concentrate on a theoretically justified model, the ghost dark energy model. Within the framework of the spherical collapse model, we evaluate effects of dark energy perturbations both at the linear and non-linear level and transfer these results into an observable quantity, the mass function, by speculatively taking into account contributions of dark energy to the mass of the haloes. We showed that the growth rate is higher in ghost models and that perturbations enhance the number of structures with respect to the Λ cold dark matter model, with stronger effects when the total mass takes into account dark energy clumps.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196950","cosmology: theory;dark energy;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Statistical correlations (or lack thereof) between redshifts, residuals (differences between the observed distance moduli and those calculated from the best-fitting cosmological model), and observational uncertainties suggest that the former scenario is the better description, so that one can use the traditional formula for the luminosity distance safely without worry.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196910","supernovae: general;cosmological parameters;cosmology: observations;cosmology: theory;dark energy;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2, we attain sufficient numerical resolution to follow gas collapsing into the centre of the minihalo from cosmological initial conditions up to densities of 1012 cm−3, at which point we form sink particles. This allows us to study how the presence of a CXB affects the formation of H2 and HD in the gas prior to becoming fully molecular. Using a suite of simulations for a range of possible CXB models, we follow each simulation for 5000 yr after the first sink particle forms. The CXB provides two competing effects, with X-rays both heating the gas and increasing the free electron fraction, allowing more H2 to form. X-ray heating dominates below n ∼ 1 cm−3, while the additional H2 cooling becomes more important above n ∼ 102 cm−3. The gas becomes optically thick to X-rays as it exits the quasi-hydrostatic ‘loitering phase’, such that the primary impact of the CXB is to cool the gas at intermediate densities, resulting in an earlier onset of baryonic collapse into the dark matter halo. At the highest densities, self-shielding results in similar thermodynamic behaviour across a wide range of CXB strengths. Consequently, we find that star formation is relatively insensitive to the presence of a CXB; both the number and the characteristic mass of the stars formed remains quite similar even as the strength of the CXB varies by several orders of magnitude.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196947","stars: formation;stars: Population III;cosmology: theory;early Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The morphology, extent and multiwavelength observations of FBs, especially X-rays, constrain various physical parameters such as SFR, age, and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) density. We show that the interaction of the CGM with the Galactic wind driven by star formation in the central region can explain the observed surface brightness and morphological features of X-rays associated with the FBs. Furthermore, assuming that cosmic ray electrons are accelerated in situ by shocks and/or turbulence, the brightness and morphology of γ-ray emission and the microwave haze can be explained.

We test MAGGIE-L and MAGGIE-M (in which group masses are derived from AM applied to the group luminosities and stellar masses, respectively) on groups of at least three galaxies extracted from a mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy redshift survey, incorporating realistic observational errors on galaxy luminosities and stellar masses. In comparison with the optimal Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group finder, groups extracted with MAGGIE are much less likely to be secondary fragments of true groups; in primary fragments, its galaxy memberships (relative to the virial sphere of the real-space group) are much more complete and usually more reliable, and its masses are much less biased and usually with less scatter, as are its group luminosities and stellar masses (computed in MAGGIEusing the membership probabilities as weights). FoF outperforms MAGGIE only for high-mass clusters: for the reliability of the galaxy population and the dispersion of its total mass. In comparison with our implementation of the Yang et al. group finder, MAGGIE reaches much higher completeness and slightly lower group fragmentation and dispersion on group total masses, luminosities and stellar masses, but slightly greater bias in the latter two and lower reliabilities. MAGGIE should therefore lead to sharper trends of environmental effects on galaxies and more accurate mass–orbit modelling.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196911","methods: numerical;galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: groups: general;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We extend the analysis by examining the X-ray light curves, finding a consistent correlation. We therefore explore how the parameters of these correlations relate to the prompt emission phase and, using a Monte Carlo simulation, explore whether these correlations are consistent with predictions of the standard afterglow model. We find significant correlations between: log  LO, 200 s and log  LX, 200 s; αO, >200 s and αX, >200 s, consistent with simulations. The model also predicts relationships between log Eiso and log  L200 s; however, while we find such relationships in the observed sample, the slope of the linear regression is shallower than that simulated and inconsistent at ≳3σ. Simulations also do not agree with correlations observed between log  L200 s and α> 200 s, or $\rm log\;\it E_{iso}$ and α> 200 s. Overall, these observed correlations are consistent with a common underlying physical mechanism producing GRBs and their afterglows regardless of their detailed temporal behaviour. However, a basic afterglow model has difficulty explaining all the observed correlations.

Our results indicate a rather poor GCS of ≈1000 members. Its azimuthal distribution follows the shape of the galaxy bulge. The GC colour distribution is peculiar, presenting an intermediate subpopulation in addition to blue and red ones. This intermediate subgroup can be explained by a single stellar population with an age of 1.53 Gyr and 0.5–1 Z⊙. The GC-specific frequency SN = 1.3 ± 0.15 is surprisingly low for a galaxy of its class. The GC luminosity function is also peculiar, with an excess of bright GCs compared to the expected Gaussian distribution. The underlying galaxy body has significant substructure, with remnants of spiral arms, dust filaments, and isophote twisting. This, and the fact that NGC 4753 hosted two Type Ia supernovae, support the possibility that the intermediate GC subpopulation may have originated during a recent merger, 13 Gyr ago.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196976","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD;galaxies: star clusters: individual: NGC 4753","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We detected and analysed morphological components beyond the multiple-shell structure of this PN, to investigate the small-scale morphological components aligned towards its major axis (such as knots and ansae, as well as the arc-like features) and its surroundings. Thus, we investigated the morpho-kinematical properties of NGC 3242, as well as their nature and formation. Our results regarding the elliptical double-shell structure and the distance to this nebula are in concordance with previous studies. Furthermore, we have used the software SHAPE to construct a 3D model of NGC 3242, allowing us to successfully reproduce our observational data. We conclude that the prominent knots emitting in the [N II] line are fast, low-ionization emission regions related to high-velocity jets and the so-called ansae-like features rather resemble bubbles. The disruptions immersed in the halo, whose emission was detected in the [O III] high-excitation emission line, remarkably display high velocities and were formed likely in an earlier ejection event, in comparison to the innermost low-ionization structures and bubbles.

For a particular choice of broad emission-line region (BLR) geometry, H β surface emissivity based on photoionization models, and using a scaled version of the 13-yr optical continuum light-curve as a proxy for the driving ionizing continuum, we explore several key factors that determine the broad emission-line luminosity L, characteristic size RRW, and variability amplitude (i.e. responsivity) η, as well as the interplay between them. For fixed boundary models which extend as far as the hot dust the predicted delays for H β are on average too long. However, the predicted variability amplitude of H β provides a remarkably good match to observations except during low-continuum states. We suggest that the continuum flux variations which drive the redistribution in H β surface emissivity F(r) do not on their own lead to large enough changes in RRW or ηeff. We thus investigate dust-bounded BLRs for which the location of the effective outer boundary is modulated by the continuum level and the dust-sublimation and dust-condensation time-scales. We find that in order to match the observed variability amplitude of broad H β in NGC 5548 a rather static outer boundary is preferred. Intriguingly, we show that the most effective way of reducing the H β delay, while preserving its responsivity and equivalent width, is to invoke a smaller value in the incident ionizing photon flux ΦH for a given ionizing source–cloud radial distance r, than is normally inferred from the observed UV continuum flux and typical models of the continuum spectral energy distribution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196932","methods: numerical;galaxies: active;quasars: emission lines;galaxies: Seyfert","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

At ≃3 Myr, both stars dissipated their discs recently and are interesting objects for probing star and planet formation. Profile distortions and Zeeman signatures are detected in the unpolarized and circularly polarized lines, whose rotational modulation we modelled using tomographic imaging, yielding brightness and magnetic maps for both stars. We find that the large-scale magnetic fields of V819 Tau and V830 Tau are mostly poloidal and can be approximated at large radii by 350–400 G dipoles tilted at ≃30° to the rotation axis. They are significantly weaker than the field of GQ Lup, an accreting classical T Tauri star (cTTS) with similar mass and age which can be used to compare the magnetic properties of wTTSs and cTTSs. The reconstructed brightness maps of both stars include cool spots and warm plages. Surface differential rotation is small, typically ≃4.4 times smaller than on the Sun, in agreement with previous results on wTTSs. Using our Doppler images to model the activity jitter and filter it out from the radial velocity (RV) curves, we obtain RV residuals with dispersions of 0.033 and 0.104 km s−1 for V819 Tau and V830 Tau, respectively. RV residuals suggest that a hot Jupiter may be orbiting V830 Tau, though additional data are needed to confirm this preliminary result.

We find a clear dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger for more luminous samples. The measurements are successfully interpreted within the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework with central and satellite velocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and to model redshift-space distortion effects. In agreement with previous studies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes. Including the redshift-space 2PCFs helps tighten the HOD constraints. Moreover, we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres, with the velocity dispersion about 30 per cent that of the dark matter. Such a relative motion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find that central galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect to their host haloes. The motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples is consistent with their following that of the dark matter. For faint samples, satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloes about 85 per cent that of the dark matter. We discuss possible applications of the velocity bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. In the appendix, we characterize the distribution of galaxy redshift measurement errors, which is well described by a Gaussian-convolved double exponential distribution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196973","galaxies: distances and redshifts;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: statistics;cosmology: observations;cosmology: theory;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We apply an innovative new model that allows us to determine key properties of the acceleration zone via multifrequency observations. The central component of the model is a relativistic steady-state fluid flow, and the emission from physically distinct regions can be seen to contribute to different energy bands in the overall spectrum. By fitting with unprecedented accuracy to 42 simultaneous multiwavelength blazar spectra, we are able to constrain the location of the brightest synchrotron emitting region, and show that there must be a linear relation between the jet power and the radius of the brightest region of the jet. We also find a correlation between the length of the accelerating region and the maximum bulk Lorentz factor of the jet and find evidence for a bimodal distribution of accretion rates in the blazar population. This allows us to put constraints on the basic dynamical and structural properties of blazar jets and to understand the underlying physical differences which result in the blazar sequence.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196898","MHD;radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;galaxies: active;galaxies: jets;gamma-rays: galaxies;radio continuum: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Gas in clusters is well studied in the hot (> 106 K) and cold (< 104 K) regimes, but the warm gas component (104–106 K) is poorly constrained. It is challenging to observe directly, but can be probed through Ly α absorption studies. We produce the first systematic study of the warm gas content of galaxy clusters through synthetic Ly α absorption studies using cosmological simulations of two galaxy clusters produced with ENZO. We explore the spatial and kinematic properties of our cluster absorbers, and show that the majority of the identified absorbers are due to fast moving gas associated with cluster infall from intergalactic medium (IGM) filaments. Towards the centre of the clusters, however, the warm IGM filaments are no longer dominant and the absorbers tend to have higher column densities and metallicities, representing stripped galaxy material. We predict that the absorber velocity distribution should generally be bi-modal and discuss the effects of cluster size, mass, and morphology on the properties of the identified absorbers, and the overall cluster warm gas content. We find tentative evidence for a change in the well-known increasing $N_{\rm {H\,\small {I}}}$ with decreasing impact parameter for the most massive dark matter haloes. Our results are compared directly to observations of Ly α absorbers in the Virgo cluster, and provide predictions for future Ly α absorption studies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196965","methods: numerical;galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium;intergalactic medium","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here we show, however, that this double RC phenomenon is more likely to be another manifestation of multiple populations observed in globular clusters (GCs) in the metal-rich regime. As in the bulge GC Terzan 5, the helium enhanced second-generation stars in the classical bulge component of the Milky Way are placed on the bright RC, which is about 0.5 mag brighter than the normal RC originated from the first-generation stars, producing the observed double RC. In a composite bulge, where a classical bulge can coexist with a boxy pseudo bulge, our models can also reproduce key observations, such as the dependence of the double RC feature on metallicity and Galactic latitude and longitude. If confirmed by Gaia trigonometric parallax distances, this would indicate that the Milky Way bar is not sufficiently buckled to form the X-shaped structure in the bulge, and suggest that the early-type galaxies would be similarly prevailed by super-helium-rich subpopulation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196975","stars: horizontal branch;Galaxy: bulge;Galaxy: formation;globular clusters: general;Galaxy: structure;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, we examine the toroidal fields of a sample of 55 stars with magnetic maps, with masses in the range 0.1–1.5 M⊙. We find that the energy contained in toroidal fields has a power-law dependence on the energy contained in poloidal fields. However the power index is not constant across our sample, with stars less and more massive than 0.5 M⊙ having power indices of 0.72 ± 0.08 and 1.25 ± 0.06, respectively. There is some evidence that these two power laws correspond to stars in the saturated and unsaturated regimes of the rotation-activity relation. Additionally, our sample shows that strong toroidal fields must be generated axisymmetrically. The latitudes at which these bands appear depend on the stellar rotation period with fast rotators displaying higher latitude bands than slow rotators.

In this work, we collect a sample of XRBs and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) with wide distribution of Eddington ratios (LX/LEdd ∼ 10−9–10−3) to re-explore the Fundamental Plane between 5 GHz radio luminosity, LR, 2–10 keV X-ray luminosity, LX, and black hole (BH) mass, MBH, namely log LR = ξXlog LX + ξMlog MBH + constant. For the whole sample, we confirm the former Fundamental Plane of Merloni et al. and Falcke et al. that ξX ∼ 0.6 and ξM ∼ 0.8 even after including more quiescent BHs. The quiescent BHs follow the Fundamental Plane very well, and, however, FR I radio galaxies follow a steeper track comparing other BH sources. After excluding FR Is, we investigate the Fundamental Plane for BHs in quiescent state with LX < LX,c and sub-Eddington BHs with LX > LX,c, respectively, and both sub-samples have a similar slope, ξX ∼ 0.6, which support that quiescent BHs may behave similar to those in low-hard state. We further select two sub-samples of AGNs with BH mass in a narrow range (FR Is with MBH = 108.8±0.4 and other LLAGNs with MBH = 108.0±0.4) to simulate the behaviour of a single supermassive BH evolving from sub-Eddington to quiescent state. We find that the highly sub-Eddington sources with LX/LEdd ∼ 10−6–10−9 still roughly stay on the extension of radio–X-ray correlation as defined by other sub-Eddington BHs. Our results are consistent with several recent observations in XRBs that the radio–X-ray correlation as defined in low-hard state can extend to highly sub-Eddington quiescent state.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196913","accretion, accretion discs;black hole physics;methods: statistical;ISM: jets and outflows;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In particular, no overabundance of corotating satellites pairs is observed within ∼20°–50° of direct opposition, as would be expected for planar distributions inclined relative to the line of sight. Instead, the excess corotation for satellite pairs within ∼10° of opposition is consistent with random noise associated with undersampling of an underlying isotropic velocity distribution. Based upon the observed dynamics of the luminous satellite population, we conclude that at most 10 per cent of isolated hosts harbour corotating satellite planes (as traced by bright satellites).","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196907","galaxies: dwarf;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;Local Group;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This in principle allows self-consistent models of reionization that exploit the accurate representation of the diffuse gas distribution together with the realistic growth of galaxies provided by these simulations, within a representative cosmological volume. In this work, we apply and compare two radiative transfer algorithms implemented in a GPU-accelerated code to the 106.5-Mpc-wide volume of Illustris in post-processing in order to investigate the reionization transition predicted by this model. We find that the first generation of galaxies formed by Illustris is just about able to reionize the universe by redshift z ∼ 7, provided quite optimistic assumptions about the escape fraction and the resolution limitations are made. Our most optimistic model finds an optical depth of τ ≃ 0.065, which is in very good agreement with recent Planck2015 determinations. Furthermore, we show that moment-based approaches for radiative transfer with the M1 closure give broadly consistent results with our angular-resolved radiative transfer scheme. In our favoured fiducial model, 20 per cent of the hydrogen is reionized by redshift z = 9.20, and this rapidly climbs to 80 per cent by redshift z = 6.92. It then takes until z = 6.24 before 99 per cent of the hydrogen is ionized. On average, reionization proceeds ‘inside-out’ in our models, with a size distribution of reionized bubbles that progressively features regions of ever larger size while the abundance of small bubbles stays fairly constant.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196945","radiative transfer;methods: numerical;H II regions;galaxies: high-redshift;intergalactic medium;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The evolved status of MN18 is supported by the detection of nitrogen overabundance in the nebula, which implies that it is composed of processed material ejected by the star. We analysed the spectrum of MN18 by using the code CMFGEN, obtaining a stellar effective temperature of ≈21 kK. The star is highly reddened, E(B − V) ≈ 2 mag.

DPAH+ molecules show features that arise due to the stretching of the aliphatic C–D bond. Deuterated PAHs have been previously reported as carriers for such features. However, preferred conditions of ionization of PAHs in the interstellar medium (ISM) indicates the possibility of the formation of DPAH+ molecules. Comparison of band positions of DPAH+s shows reasonable agreement with the observations. We report the effect of size of the DPAH+ molecules on band positions and intensities. This study also reports a D/H ratio ([D/H]$\rm _{sc}$; the ratio of C–D stretch and C–H stretch bands per [D/H]$\rm _{num}$) that is decreasing with the increasing size of DPAH+s. It is noted that large DPAH+ molecules (no. of C atoms ∼50) match the D/H ratio that has been estimated from observations.

We aim to test how well these chemical abundance signatures are preserved in the gas prior to forming the first long-lived low-mass stars (or second-generation stars). Our results show that second-generation stars can retain the nucleosynthetic signature of their Pop III progenitors, even in the presence of nucleosynthetically normal Pop III core-collapse supernovae. We find that carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars are likely second-generation stars that form in minihaloes. Furthermore, it is likely that the majority of Pop III supernovae produce high [C/Fe] yields. In contrast, metals ejected by a PISN are not concentrated in the first star-forming haloes, which may explain the absence of observed PISN signatures in metal-poor stars. We also find that unique Pop III abundance signatures in the gas are quickly wiped out by the emergence of Pop II supernovae. We caution that the observed fractions of stars with Pop III signatures cannot be directly interpreted as the fraction of Pop III stars producing that signature. Such interpretations require modelling the metal enrichment process prior to the second-generation stars’ formation, including results from simulations of metal mixing. The full potential of stellar archaeology can likely be reached in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, where the simple formation history may allow for straightforward identification of second-generation stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197152","stars: chemically peculiar;stars: Population II;stars: Population III;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;dark ages, reionization, first stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Most previous implementations of BH accretion in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have assumed that BHs grow at an accretion rate that is proportion to the Bondi rate. A major concern is that the Bondi accretion rate is inappropriate when the accreting material has significant angular momentum. We present an improved accretion model that takes into account the circularization and subsequent viscous transport of infalling material, and implemented as a ‘subgrid’ model in hydrodynamic simulations. The resulting accretion rates are generally low in low mass (≲ 1011.5 M⊙) haloes, but show outbursts of Eddington-limited accretion during galaxy mergers. During outbursts these objects strongly resemble quasars. In higher mass haloes, gas accretion peaks at ∼10 per cent of the Eddington rate, which is thought to be conducive to the formation of radio jets. The resulting accretion rate depends strongly on the effective pressure of the gas surrounding the BH, which in turn depends strongly on halo mass. This induces a sharp transition in the importance of BH feedback. In small haloes, the growth of galaxies is regulated by star formation and supernova feedback, but above a halo mass of 1011.5 M⊙, rapid BH growth leads to the suppression of star formation and reduced growth of stellar mass with increasing halo mass.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197155","black hole physics;methods: numerical;galaxies: active;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;quasars: general","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The inclination angle itself is derived from the spectropolarimetric data on broad emission lines using the theory for the generation of polarized radiation developed by Sobolev and Chandrasekhar. As the result, the new estimates of SMBH masses in AGN with measured polarization of BLR are presented.

We examine the effect of Born-corrections for lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in an analytical approach by taking perturbative corrections to the geodesic into account. The resulting extra power in the lensing potential spectrum is comparable to the power generated by non-linear structure formation and affects especially the polarization spectra, leading to relative changes of the order of 10−3 for the E-mode spectrum and several per cent on all scales to the B-mode spectrum. In contrast, there is only little change of spectra involving the CMB temperature. Additionally, the corrections excite one more degree of freedom resulting in a deflection component which cannot be described as a gradient of the lensing potential as it is related to image rotation in lens–lens coupling.

We determine the power spectrum density of all the observed bands and show that after taking into account the host contamination similar power is observed in the optical and near-IR bands. There is evidence for a correlation between the light curves of the X-ray photon flux and the optical B band, but it is not possible to determine a lag with certainty, with the most likely value being around 0 d. Strong correlation is seen between the optical and near-IR bands. Cross-correlation analysis shows some complex probability distributions and lags that range from 10 to 20 d, with the near-IR following the optical variations. Filtering the light curves in frequency space shows that the strongest correlations are those corresponding to the shortest time-scales. We discuss the nature of the X-ray variability and conclude that this is intrinsic and cannot be accounted for by absorption episodes due to material intervening in the line of sight. It is also found that the lags agree with the relation τ ∝ λ4/3, as expected for an optically thick geometrically thin accretion disc, although for a larger disc than that predicted by the estimated black hole mass and accretion rate in MCG-6-30-15. The cross-correlation analysis suggests that the torus is located at ∼20 light-days from the central source and at most at ∼50 light-days from the central region.

An appealing opportunity was to detect additional non-radial modes, thus opening the possibility to perform asteroseismic studies and making the pulsational content of Galactic Cepheids more similar to that of Magellanic Clouds ones. However, only hints of cycle-to-cycle variations were found, without any strict periodicity. In this context the potential of the CoRoT exoplanetary data base was not fully exploited despite the wide area covered on the Galactic plane. Therefore, we investigated all the candidate Cepheids pointed out by the automatic classification of the CoRoT curves. At the end, we could identify seven bona fide Cepheids. The light curves were investigated to remove some instrumental effects. The frequency analysis was particularly delicate since these small effects can be enhanced by the large amplitude, resulting in the presence of significant, but spurious, peaks in the power spectrum. Indeed, the careful evaluation of a very attracting peak in the spectra of CoRoT 0102618121 allowed us to certify its spurious origin. Once that the instrumental effects were properly removed, no additional mode was detected. On the other hand, cycle-to-cycle variations of the Fourier parameters were observed, but very small and always within ±3σ. Among the seven Cepheids, there are two Pop. I first-overtone pulsators, four Pop. I fundamental mode pulsators, and one Pop. II star. The CoRoT colours allowed us to measure that times of maximum brightness occur a little earlier (about 0.01 period) at short wavelengths than at long ones.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197092","methods: data analysis;stars: individual: V376 Mon;stars: individual: DP Mon;stars: interiors;stars: oscillations;stars: variables: Cepheids","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"A wide binary trigger for white dwarf pollution","A. Bonsor; D. Veras",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","454","1","53","63","Metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres is commonly assumed to be a signature of remnant planetary systems. Most explanations for this pollution predict a sharp decrease in the number of polluted systems with white dwarf cooling age. Observations do not confirm this trend, and metal pollution in old (1–5 Gyr) white dwarfs is difficult to explain. We propose an alternative, time-independent mechanism to produce the white dwarf pollution. The orbit of a wide binary companion can be perturbed by Galactic tides, approaching close to the primary star for the first time after billions of years of evolution on the white dwarf branch. We show that such a close approach perturbs a planetary system orbiting the white dwarf, scattering planetesimals on to star-grazing orbits, in a manner that could pollute the white dwarf's atmosphere. Our estimates find that this mechanism is likely to contribute to metal pollution, alongside other mechanisms, in up to a few per cent of an observed sample of white dwarfs with wide binary companions, independent of white dwarf age. This age independence is the key difference between this wide binary mechanism and others mechanisms suggested in the literature to explain white dwarf pollution. Current observational samples are not large enough to assess whether this mechanism makes a significant contribution to the population of polluted white dwarfs, for which better constraints on the wide binary population are required, such as those that will be obtained in the near future with Gaia.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197097","Oort Cloud;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;planet–star interactions;stars: AGB and post-AGB;stars: evolution;stars: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We use a suite of halo occupation distribution mocks in a simulation, identify voids in these populations using the ZOBOV void finder and measure their abundances, sizes, tracer densities and dark matter content. To separate the effects of bias from those of sampling density, we do the same for voids traced by randomly downsampled subsets of the simulation dark matter particles. At the same sampling density, galaxy bias reduces the total number of voids by ∼50 per cent and can dramatically change their size distribution. The matter content of voids in biased and unbiased tracers also differs. Deducing void properties from simulation therefore requires the use of realistic galaxy mocks. We discuss how the void observables can be related to their matter content. In particular we consider the compensation of the total mass deficit in voids and find that the distinction between over- and undercompensated voids is not a function of void size alone, as has previously been suggested. However, we find a simple linear relationship between the average density of tracers in the void and the total mass compensation on much larger scales. The existence of this linear relationship holds independent of the bias and sampling density of the tracers. This provides a universal tool to classify void environments and will be important for the use of voids in observational cosmology.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197135","methods: data analysis;methods: numerical;cosmology: observations;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By making use of the known Geminids meteoroid flux on Earth we found this ratio to be 2.1 × 10−3 on average. We compare this luminous efficiency with other estimations derived in the past for other meteoroid streams and also compare it with other estimations that we present here for the first time by making use of crater diameter measurements.

The wide-band spectral data with low-energy coverage allowed us to characterize the broad-band continuum and detect the CRSFs. We find that the broad-band continuum is adequately described by a combination of a low temperature (kT ∼ 0.8 keV) blackbody and a power law with high energy cutoff (Ecut ∼ 5.4 keV) without the need for a broad Gaussian at ∼10 keV as used in some earlier studies. Though winds from the companion can affect the emission from the neutron star at low energies (<3 keV), the blackbody component shows a significant presence in our continuum model. We report evidence for the possible presence of two independent sets of CRSFs with fundamentals at ∼11 and ∼15 keV. These two sets of CRSFs could arise from spatially distinct emitting regions. We also find evidence for variations in the line equivalent widths, with the 11 keV CRSF weakening and the 15 keV line strengthening with decreasing luminosity. Finally, we propose that the reason for the earlier observed anticorrelation of line energy with luminosity could be due to modelling of these two independent line sets (∼11 and ∼15 keV) as a single CRSF.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197107","line: identification;pulsars: individual: 4U 0115+63;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Bayesian statistics as a new tool for spectral analysis – I. Application for the determination of basic parameters of massive stars","J. -. Mugnes; C.

However, the methods considered to perform this kind of analysis are mostly based on iteration among a few diagnostic lines to determine the stellar parameters. While these methods are often simple and fast, they can lead to errors and large uncertainties due to the required assumptions. Here, we present a method based on Bayesian statistics to find simultaneously the best combination of effective temperature, surface gravity, projected rotational velocity, and microturbulence velocity, using all the available spectral lines. Different tests are discussed to demonstrate the strength of our method, which we apply to 54 mid-resolution spectra of field and cluster B stars obtained at the Observatoire du Mont-Mégantic. We compare our results with those found in the literature. Differences are seen which are well explained by the different methods used. We conclude that the B-star microturbulence velocities are often underestimated. We also confirm the trend that B stars in clusters are on average faster rotators than field B stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197086","methods: data analysis;methods: statistical;techniques: spectroscopic;stars: atmospheres;stars: massive;stars: rotation","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The mHz QPOs in the XMM-Newton/RXTE observations show significant frequency variation and disappear right before type I X-ray bursts. We find no significant correlation between the mHz QPO frequency and the temperature of the neutron-star surface, which is different from theoretical predictions. For the first time we observed the full lifetime of a mHz QPO lasting 19 ks. Besides, we also measure a frequency drift time-scale ∼15 ks, we speculate that this is the cooling time-scale of a layer deeper than the burning depth, possibly heated by the previous burst. Moreover, the analysis of all X-ray bursts in this source shows that all type I X-ray bursts associated with the mHz QPOs are short, bright and energetic, suggesting a potential connection between mHz QPOs and He-rich X-ray bursts.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197119","accretion, accretion discs;stars: neutron;X-rays: binaries;X-rays: individual: 4U 1636–53","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Self-consistent triaxial models","J. L. Sanders; N. W. Evans",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","454","1","299","314","We present self-consistent triaxial stellar systems that have analytic distribution functions (DFs) expressed in terms of the actions. These provide triaxial density profiles with cores or cusps at the centre. They are the first self-consistent triaxial models with analytic DFs suitable for modelling giant ellipticals and dark haloes. Specifically, we study triaxial models that reproduce the Hernquist profile from Williams & Evans, as well as flattened isochrones of the form proposed by Binney. We explore the kinematics and orbital structure of these models in some detail. The models typically become more radially anisotropic on moving outwards, have velocity ellipsoids aligned in Cartesian coordinates in the centre and aligned in spherical polar coordinates in the outer parts. In projection, the ellipticity of the isophotes and the position angle of the major axis of our models generally changes with radius. So, a natural application is to elliptical galaxies that exhibit isophote twisting. As triaxial Stäckel models do not show isophote twists, our DFs are the first to generate mass density distributions that do exhibit this phenomenon, typically with a gradient of ≈10°/effective radius, which is comparable to the data. Triaxiality is a natural consequence of models that are susceptible to the radial orbit instability. We show how a family of spherical models with anisotropy profiles that transition from isotropic at the centre to radially anisotropic becomes unstable when the outer anisotropy is made sufficiently radial. Models with a larger outer anisotropy can be constructed but are found to be triaxial. We argue that the onset of the radial orbit instability can be identified with the transition point when adiabatic relaxation yields strongly triaxial rather than weakly spherical endpoints.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197091","methods: analytical;methods: numerical;Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We confirm that the specific star formation rate matches that in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey. We show that the [O II] LF at z = 1.0 from the MBII shows good agreement with the LFs from several surveys below L([O II]) = 1043.0 erg s−1 while the low redshifts (z ≤ 0.3) show an excess in the prediction of bright [O II] galaxies, but still displaying a good match with observations below L([O II]) = 1041.6 erg s−1.

Here, we use optical gi imaging from Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam and near infrared JHK imaging from United Kingdom Infrared Telescope/Wide Field Camera to conduct a comprehensive survey of the structure of IC 10. We examine the spatial distribution of its resolved young, intermediate and old stellar populations to large radius and low effective surface brightness levels. Akin to other dwarfs with multiple populations of different ages, stellar populations of decreasing average age are increasingly concentrated in this galaxy. We find that the young, starbursting population and the asymptotic giant branch population are both offset from the geometric centre of the older red giant branch (RGB) population by a few hundred parsecs, implying that the younger star formation occurred significantly away from the centre of the galaxy. The RGB population traces an extended structure that is typical of blue compact galaxies, with an effective radius of ∼5.75 arcmin (∼1.25 kpc). These measurements show that IC 10 is much more extended than has previously been realized, and this blue compact galaxy is one of the most extended dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. The outermost isophotes of this galaxy are very regular in shape and essentially circular in morphology.

However, most of our knowledge originates from targeted observations of small samples, which are strongly biased to sources which are peculiar at other wavelengths. In order to tackle this problem we have conducted a deep 1.4 GHz survey by using the Australian Telescope Compact Array, with a net bandwidth of 1.7 GHz (1.4–3.1 GHz) , following the same observing setup as that used for the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey project, this time choosing a region more appropriate for stellar work. In this paper, the Stellar Continuum Originating from Radio Physics In Ourgalaxy (SCORPIO) project is presented as well as results from the pilot experiment. The achieved rms is 30 μJy and the angular resolution ∼10 arcsec. 614 point-like sources have been extracted just from the pilot field. Only 34 of them are classified in SIMBAD or the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. About 80 per cent of the extracted sources are reported in one of the inspected catalogues and 50 per cent of them appears to belong to a reddened stellar/Galactic population. However, the evaluation of extragalactic contaminants is very difficult without further investigations. Interesting results have been obtained for extended radio sources that fall in the SCORPIO field. Many roundish-like structures (indicated as bubbles in the following) have been found, some of which are classified at other wavelengths. However, for all of these sources, our project has provided us with images of unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197123","techniques: interferometric;stars: evolution;stars: formation;Galaxy: stellar content;radio continuum: ISM;radio continuum: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Duschl",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","454","1","766","803","We present an updated mid-infrared (MIR) versus X-ray correlation for the local active galactic nuclei (AGN) population based on the high angular resolution 12 and 18μm continuum fluxes from the AGN subarcsecond MIR atlas and 2–10 keV and 14–195 keV data collected from the literature. We isolate a sample of 152 objects with reliable AGN nature and multi-epoch X-ray data and minimal MIR contribution from star formation. Although the sample is not homogeneous or complete, we show that our results are unlikely to be affected by significant biases. The MIR–X-ray correlation is nearly linear and within a factor of 2 independent of the AGN type and the wavebands used. The observed scatter is <0.4 dex. A possible flattening of the correlation slope at the highest luminosities probed (∼1045  erg s−1) towards low MIR luminosities for a given X-ray luminosity is indicated but not significant. Unobscured objects have, on average, an MIR–X-ray ratio that is only ≤0.15 dex higher than that of obscured objects. Objects with intermediate X-ray column densities (22 < log NH < 23) actually show the highest MIR–X-ray ratio on average. Radio-loud objects show a higher mean MIR–X-ray ratio at low luminosities while the ratio is lower than average at high luminosities. This may be explained by synchrotron emission from the jet contributing to the MIR at low luminosities and additional X-ray emission at high luminosities. True Seyfert 2 candidates do not show any deviation from the general behaviour suggesting that they possess a dusty obscurer as in other AGN. Double AGN also do not deviate. Finally, we show that the MIR–X-ray correlation can be used to investigate the AGN nature of uncertain objects. Specifically, we give equations that allow us to determine the intrinsic 2–10 keV luminosities and column densities for objects with complex X-ray properties to within 0.34 dex. These techniques are applied to the uncertain objects of the remaining AGN MIR atlas, demonstrating the usefulness of the MIR–X-ray correlation as an empirical tool.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197110","galaxies: active;galaxies: Seyfert;infrared: galaxies;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This allows us to study the narrow-line region (NLR) of the quasar and the Lyman α emission from the host galaxy. Using CLOUDY models that explain the presence of strong N V and P V absorption together with the detection of Si II* and O I** absorption in the DLA, we show that the density and the distance of the cloud to the quasar are in the ranges 180 < nH < 710 cm−3 and 580 > r0 > 230 pc, respectively. Sizes of the neutral (∼2–9pc) and highly ionized phases (∼3–80pc) are consistent with the partial coverage of the C IV BLR by the C IV absorption from the DLA (covering factor of ∼0.85). We show that the residuals are consistent with emission from the NLR with C IV/Lyman α ratios varying from 0 to 0.29 through the profile. Remarkably, we detect extended Lyman α emission up to 25 kpc to the north and west directions and 15 kpc to the south and east. We interpret the emission as the superposition of strong emission in the plane of the galaxy up to 10 kpc with emission in a wind of projected velocity ∼500 km s−1 which is seen up to 25 kpc. The low metallicity of the DLA (0.27 solar) argues for at least part of this gas being infalling towards the active galactic nucleus and possibly being located where accretion from cold streams ends up.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197130","galaxies: evolution;intergalactic medium;quasars: absorption lines;quasars: individual: SDSS J082303.22+052907.6","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is found that while T90 itself performs very well in distinguishing short and long GRBs, the overall success ratio is higher when the training set is complemented by MVTS and HE.

Recently, it has been hypothesized that the missing O could be hidden in μm-sized H2O ice grains. We examine this hypothesis by comparing the infrared (IR) extinction and far-IR emission arising from these grains with that observed in the Galactic diffuse ISM. We find that it is possible for the diffuse ISM to accommodate ∼160 ppm of O/H in μm-sized H2O ice grains without violating the observational constraints including the absence of the 3.1 μm O–H absorption feature. More specifically, H2O ice grains of radii ∼4 μm and O/H = 160 ppm are capable of accounting for the observed flat extinction at ∼3–8 μm and produce no excessive emission in the far-IR. These grains could be present in the diffuse ISM through rapid exchange of material between dense molecular clouds where they form and diffuse clouds where they are destroyed by photosputtering.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197093","ISM: abundances;dust, extinction;infrared: ISM","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The SN presents a double-peaked light curve (LC) similar to that of SN 1993J, although more luminous and with a longer cooling phase after the primary peak. The spectral evolution is also similar to SN 1993J's, with hydrogen dominating the spectra to ∼40 d, then helium gaining strength, and nebular emission lines appearing from ∼60 d post-explosion. The velocities derived from the P-Cygni absorptions are overall similar to those of other type IIb SNe. We have found a strong similarity between the oxygen and magnesium line profiles at late times, which suggests that these lines are forming at the same location within the ejecta. The hydrodynamical modelling of the pseudo-bolometric LC and the observed photospheric velocities suggest that SN 2011fu was the explosion of an extended star (R∼ 450 R⊙), in which 1.3 × 1051 erg of kinetic energy were released and 0.15 M⊙ of 56Ni were synthesized. In addition, a better reproduction of the observed early pseudo-bolometric LC is achieved if a more massive H-rich envelope than for other type IIb SNe is considered (0.3 M⊙). The hydrodynamical modelling of the LC and the comparison of our late-time spectra with nebular spectral models for type IIb SNe, point to a progenitor for SN 2011fu with a Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) mass of 13–18 M⊙.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197120","supernovae: general;supernovae: individual: SN 2011fu","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Although no repeat pulses were detected the survey yielded the detection of a new FRB, described in Petroff et al. (2015a). From our observations we rule out periodic repeating sources with periods P ≤ 8.6 h and rule out sources with periods 8.6 < P < 21 h at the 90 per cent confidence level. At P ≥ 21 h our limits fall off as ∼1/P. Dedicated and persistent observations of FRB source fields are needed to rule out repetition on longer time-scales, a task well-suited to next generation wide-field transient detectors.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197111","methods: observational;stars: magnetars;pulsars: general;radio continuum: stars","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Study of the star catalogue (epoch AD 1396.0) recorded in ancient Korean astronomical almanac","J. Jeon; Y. B. Lee; Y.

Most of the researches based on the old star catalogues were manuscript published in Europe and from Arabic/Islam. However, the old star catalogues published in East Asia did not get attention. Therefore, among the East Asian star catalogues we focus on a particular catalogue recorded in a Korean almanac. Its catalogue contains 277 stars that are positioned in a region within 10° of the ecliptic plane. The stars in the catalogue were identified using the modern Hipparcos catalogue. We identified 274 among 277 stars, which is a rate of 98.9 per cent. The catalogue records the epoch of the stars’ positions as AD 1396.0. However, by using all of the identified stars we found that the initial epoch of the catalogue is AD 1363.1 ± 3.2. In conclusion, the star catalogue was compiled and edited from various older star catalogues. We assume a correlation with the Almagest by Ptolemaios. This study presents newly analysed results from the historically important astronomical data discovered in East Asia. Therefore, this star catalogue will become important data for comparison with the star catalogues published in Europe and from Arabic/Islam.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197084","history and philosophy of astronomy;catalogues;astrometry","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Model-free analysis of quadruply imaged gravitationally lensed systems and substructured galaxies","A. G. Woldesenbet; L. L. R. Williams",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","454","1","862","875","Multiple image gravitational lens systems, and especially quads, are invaluable in determining the amount and distribution of mass in galaxies. This is usually done by mass modelling using parametric or free-form methods. An alternative way of extracting information about lens mass distribution is to use lensing degeneracies and invariants. Where applicable, they allow one to make conclusions about whole classes of lenses without model fitting. Here, we use approximate, but observationally useful invariants formed by the three relative polar angles of quad images around the lens centre to show that many smooth elliptical+shear lenses can reproduce the same set of quad image angles within observational error. This result allows us to show in a model-free way what the general class of smooth elliptical+shear lenses looks like in the three-dimensional (3D) space of image relative angles, and that this distribution does not match that of the observed quads. We conclude that, even though smooth elliptical+shear lenses can reproduce individual quads, they cannot reproduce the quad population. What is likely needed is substructure, with clump masses larger than those responsible for flux ratio anomalies in quads, or luminous or dark nearby perturber galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197115","gravitational lensing: strong;galaxies: fundamental parameters;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The first three are detected at a high level of significance, and SDSS J0924+0219 is detected. HS 0810+2554 is resolved, allowing us for the first time to achieve 10-mas resolution of the source frame in the structure of a radio-quiet quasar. The others are unresolved or marginally resolved. All four objects are among the faintest radio sources yet detected, with intrinsic flux densities in the range 1–5 μJy; such radio objects, if unlensed, will only be observable routinely with the Square Kilometre Array. The observations of HS 0810+2554, which is also detected with e-MERLIN, strongly suggest the presence of a mini active galactic nucleus, with a radio core and milliarcsecond scale jet. The flux densities of the lensed images in all but HE 0435−1223 are consistent with smooth galaxy lens models without the requirement for smaller scale substructure in the model, although some interesting anomalies are seen between optical and radio flux densities. These are probably due to microlensing effects in the optical.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197128","gravitational lensing: strong;quasars: general;radio continuum: galaxies","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Haloes light and dark: dynamical models of the stellar halo and constraints on the mass of the Galaxy","A. A. Williams; N. W. Evans",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2015","454","1","698","707","We develop a flexible set of action-based distribution functions (DFs) for stellar haloes. The DFs have five free parameters, controlling the inner and outer density slope, break radius, flattening, and anisotropy, respectively. The DFs generate flattened stellar haloes with a rapidly varying logarithmic slope in density, as well as a spherically aligned velocity ellipsoid with a long axis that points towards the Galactic Centre – all attributes possessed by the stellar halo of the Milky Way. We use our action-based DF to model the blue horizontal branch stars extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as stellar halo tracers in a spherical Galactic potential. As the selection function is hard to model, we fix the density law from earlier studies and solve for the anisotropy and gravitational potential parameters. Our best-fitting model has a velocity anisotropy that becomes more radially anisotropic on moving outwards. It changes from β ≈ 0.4 at Galactocentric radius of 15 kpc to ≈0.7 at 60 kpc. This is a gentler increase than is typically found in simulations of stellar haloes built from the multiple accretion of smaller systems. We find the potential corresponds to an almost flat rotation curve with amplitude of ≈200 km s−1 at these distances. This implies an enclosed mass of ≈4.5 × 1011 M⊙ within a spherical shell of radius 50 kpc.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv1967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8197118","Galaxy: halo;Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
