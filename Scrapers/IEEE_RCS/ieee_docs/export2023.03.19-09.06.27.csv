"Bias in data linkage studies","M. Bohensky",NA,"Methodological Developments in Data Linkage","","2016","","","63","82","In data linkage studies, selection bias can occur if the records of certain subgroups of individuals have different linkage rates to other groups. These differences in the accuracy of linkage (‘linkage errors’) may impact the assessment of study outcomes if people from certain groups are more or less likely to have the risk factors or outcomes of interest. This chapter explores some of the common issues affecting quality in the data linkage process. The types of linkage errors discussed in the chapter are: missed matches from missing linkage variables, missed matches from inconsistent case ascertainment, and false matches. The chapter presents a narrative review of the literature describing how the limitations of data linkage can impact the quality of research findings. It provides some recommendations for practice to improve the linkage process and the interpretation of results based on linked data.","","9781119072461","10.1002/9781119072454.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821259.pdf&bkn=9820796&pdfType=chapter","","Couplings;Ink;Sensitivity;Cancer;Statistics;Sociology;Systematics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Security Over Liberty","A. Vitalis",NA,"The Uncertain Digital Revolution","","2016","","","21","40","Searching for a balance between security and liberty is becoming more and more complex with the passing of time. The European Council Agreement of 1981 on the protection of data dedicate an article to files concerning the security of the State and public security, the principles defined within this article being of great importance. After the Twin Tower attacks, the American State became a State of global surveillance, viewing security as a major priority superior to the respect of individual freedoms. The Patriot Act, passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks, demanded the use of a secure machine for reading passports in order to enter U.S. territory, especially pertinent for the 27 countries previously exempt from visas. The European Union and the States that form part of it complied with U.S. requirements without hesitation as they themselves had acquired biometric equipment in their fight against illegal immigration and criminality.","","9781119340867","10.1002/9781119341277.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821146.pdf&bkn=9820801&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Law enforcement;Regulation;Inspection;Information technology;Government;Force","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter describes the current available techniques which are suitable for large population databases. It provides a description of the most basic and widely used standard scenario for PPRL: the use of a trusted third party with error‐free identification numbers. Next, a short description of most widely discussed PPRL techniques is given. Then, the chapter concentrates on a frequently used technique: Bloom filter‐based PPRL. Files beyond about 50 000 records need special techniques, since not all possible pairs in a record linkage process can be computed. The set of available techniques for such databases is described, and some comparisons to older techniques are reported. Currently known attacks on PPRL protocols, and countermeasures against these attacks are described.","","9781119072461","10.1002/9781119072454.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821228.pdf&bkn=9820796&pdfType=chapter","","Couplings;Databases;Codes;Cryptography;Phonetics;Hospitals;Protocols","","","","2","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Network management is used both in the enterprise and telecommunications industries, but naturally it originated in the telecom world. In the context of this discussion we will also review several widely implemented standards. The third section of the chapter synthesizes the above concepts in the context of Cloud, where hosted services (along with the appropriate orchestration tools) have been offered to an enterprise by the Cloud provider. As might be expected, there is not much in the way of history here – let alone standards – but the history is being made right now, at the time of this writing, and it is happening very fast with multiple open‐source initiatives! We do describe, as an example, the Amazon CloudFormation services, which have become the benchmark of the industry as a segue to the OpenStack orchestration.

There is a temptation for companies to use biometrics to control hours. Well aware of this need, some biometric companies are offering a 'working hour's management' option.

Most employers are favorable to the use of biometric systems to control the working hours of their employees. The development of videosurveillance results in a significant reduction in the freedom of movement, and increases distrust in civil society.

"Understanding (1): Piercing the Fog of War in Fluid Spaces","J. Henrotin",NA,"The Art of War in the Network Age: Back to the Future","","2016","","","75","98","“Revolution” is primarily a techno‐strategic confrontation between several historical constants that it hopes to at least disperse, if not totally dissolve. The first constant is the Clausewitzian concept of “fog of war”. The second constant is an uncertainty and a deficit of structural ontological predictability. The combination of these constants, interconnected with matters of life and death, is specific to military operations and can be summarized by A. Wavell. The technological archaeo‐history demonstrates that the drive to control the chaos of war is expressed in what Laurent Henninger calls “fluid spaces” as opposed to “solid spaces”. Semi‐Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) incorporated a series of innovations for the direct consequences on the processes of informationalization of armies, also in fluid spaces. The appearance of the system occurred while aerial defense had seen a small revolution with the appearance of detection systems on the effectors themselves.","","9781119361350","10.1002/9781119361312.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821475.pdf&bkn=9820803&pdfType=chapter","","Fluids;Chaos;Solids;Art;Uncertainty;Space vehicles;History","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Secondary analysis of linked data","R. Chambers; G. Kim",NA; NA,"Methodological Developments in Data Linkage","","2016","","","83","108","A common type of linked data analysis is regression analysis, where the underlying relationship between a response variable and a set of explanatory variables is explored by fitting a regression model to linked data. The bias correction ideas explored in Kim and Chambers were motivated by secondary analysis, in that these authors assume a model for linkage errors that only requires non‐sensitive summary information about the performance of the data linkage method. This chapter takes the same approach, using linear regression analysis to illustrate the basic ideas. It discusses measurement issues that result following a linking procedure: correct and incorrect links, and non‐links; and characterising errors from linkage and non‐linkage. The chapter describes the models for different types of linking errors: linkage errors under binary linking; linkage errors under multi‐linking; and incomplete linking. It illustrates the use of regression analysis for incomplete binary‐linked data and multi‐linked data.","","9781119072461","10.1002/9781119072454.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821366.pdf&bkn=9820796&pdfType=chapter","","Couplings;Registers;Analytical models;Linked data;Statistics;Sociology;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"How Can the Maturity of Enterprise IS Governance be Improved?","J. -L. Leignel; T. Ungaro; A. Staar",NA; NA; NA,"Digital Transformation: Information System Governance","","2016","","","29","36","Without concealing the difficulty of Enterprise IS Governance (EISG), and without prejudging the sometimes significant efforts to be implemented in order to increase its level of maturity, it is important to face this challenge in the correct manner, maintaining a holistic approach, and to progress step by step in an incremental and pragmatic way. The method is based on an evaluation grid of the maturity of the company in terms of EISG structured around 11 improvement vectors, initially defined by the Institut de la Gouvernance SI (IGSI), a joint association between the AFAI and the CIGREF.

This is also true for the most prominent agents involved in Economics and Finance. Technologies relating to information and communications, nanotechnology and the technologies involved in environmental industries and services fit perfectly in this unipolar and singlecentered world, where they take up a role of mass surveillance and monitoring. In this backdrop of heightened surveillance, video surveillance, more than ever, played an eminent role in the United Kingdom. Video surveillance systems could be biometric or vocal. Experiments were carried out and exploited. Local authorities in Newham have possessed a video surveillance system since 1998 that was capable of facial recognition from a police database of known criminals and delinquents. It is the police agents and officers and not the legal persons eminent in video surveillance that are responsible for installing the devices.","","9781119347323","10.1002/9781119347750.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821179.pdf&bkn=9820802&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Surveillance;Law;Libraries;Databases;Telephone sets;Privacy","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Dibben",NA; NA; NA,"Methodological Developments in Data Linkage","","2016","","","1","7","Recent developments in data linkage methodology have concentrated on bias in the analysis of linked data, novel approaches to organising relationships between databases and privacy‐preserving linkage. This introductory chapter provides a brief background to the development of data linkage methods and introduces a few common terms. It highlights the most important issues that have emerged in recent years and describes how this book attempts to deal with these issues. Data linkage methods may fall into two categories: the deterministic linkage method and the probabilistic linkage method. Linkage error occurs when record pairs are misclassified as links or non‐links. The impact of linkage error on analysis of linked data depends on the structure of the data, the distribution of error and the analysis to be performed. Privacy‐preserving data linkage attempts to avoid the controversial release of personal identifiers by providing means of linking and performing analysis on encrypted data.","","9781119072461","10.1002/9781119072454.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821206.pdf&bkn=9820796&pdfType=chapter","","Couplings;Probabilistic logic;Linked data;IEEE Sections;Insurance;Standards;Merging","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It first sets out the case for viewing record linkage as a missing data problem, and then discusses the existing probabilistic record linkage (PRL) methods, and shows how these can be elaborated to improve performance using prior‐informed imputation (PII). The use of multiple imputation (MI) for handling missing data in either response or predictor variables in statistical models is a common technique; it also forms the basis for the PII method. To demonstrate the use of PII, the chapter provides an example based on linkage between infection surveillance data and national audit data on admissions to paediatric intensive care, to estimate trends in bloodstream infection. Another example demonstrates the performance of PII in different linkage situations (varying identifier error rates and distribution of error) through the use of simulated data.","","9781119072461","10.1002/9781119072454.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821449.pdf&bkn=9820796&pdfType=chapter","","Couplings;Pattern matching;Joining processes;Statistical analysis;Data models;Computational modeling;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

If an American becomes the main target of interceptions, a warrant is required to continue monitoring.

Meanwhile, an American citizen can be intercepted if there are foreign communications involved. The law grants legal immunity to American operators of electronic communications accused by American justice of working with the government and secret services to engage in unlawful interceptions.

The chapter first discusses the use of record linkage technology in traditional censuses, including a case study from the 2011 England and Wales Census where the Census was linked to a post‐enumeration survey to assess Census coverage. It then reviews the different approaches taken in countries which operate a population register instead of large data collections to derive population‐level statistics.

The second refers to the categorizations of RMA done in the 1990s and of its analysts. Three lexical categories of the conceptual object of “RMA” coexist in the field of strategic studies. In view of its contemporary understanding, the concept goes back to observations made by the Soviet marshal Ogarkov in the beginning of the 1980s, of a Military Technical Revolution (MTR), and the observations of the American AirLand battle. The latter was itself the result of a specific technological effort concerning DARPA, the second Offset strategy and of the deep questioning, the reform movement, of the American forces' methods of action.","","9781119361350","10.1002/9781119361312.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821241.pdf&bkn=9820803&pdfType=chapter","","Economics;Art;Technological innovation;Security;Nuclear weapons;Military systems;Vocabulary","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter focuses on operational and technological aspects of RMA. First, the ""RMA phenomenon"" can be based on an iterative evolution, in longue duree, and this in order to avoid the traps of an “event history” and to distinguish its major trends. Secondly, the ""RMA phenomenon"" can be seen as an isolated product in conjoncture time, thus making it, strictly speaking, revolutionary. From a historical point of view, RMA presents it as an isolated phenomenon, produced by specific technological, cultural and political conceptions in a specific time period, when revolution is a matter of event history and no longer of conjoncture and longue duree.","","9781119361350","10.1002/9781119361312.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821243.pdf&bkn=9820803&pdfType=chapter","","History;Technological innovation;Art;Trajectory;Market research;Terrorism;Stress","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The chapter proceeds with a discussion of the basic enablers of data center virtualization, culminating with a description of the structure of next‐generation data centers. Then the chapter zooms in on storage‐related matters, drawing from the model developed by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA). Three types of storage are studied: direct‐attached storage, network‐attached storage, and the storage area network. In the next step, the chapter reviews the approaches to enabling the use of a single converged network for both storage access and other types of traffic: FC over Ethernet (FCoE) and Internet SCSI (iSCSI).

The chapter starts with an overview of data networking, with the classical Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Following the discussion of this model, the Internet Protocol (IP) is introduced and the Internet protocol suite is reviewed. The review highlights the fact that even though the Internet was designed around specific paradigms and with only a few applications in view, it was made fairly extensible. This extensibility is demonstrated with the examples – essential to the NFV – of the standardized means to achieve Quality of Service (QoS), a capability to support the creation of “data pipes” of specific capacity. Following that we have a section on Multi‐Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), which almost leaps out of the IP context, by effectively introducing a technology that synthesizes circuit switching with packet switching. The next step, building on the previously discussed capabilities, introduces a new dimension to virtualization – the Virtual Private Network (VPN). Further development of this topic, undertaken in a separate section, introduces the subject of a Software‐Defined Network (SDN), which gives greater control to network providers for centralized decision making about routing and forwarding of data packets. The chapter concludes with an overview of network security, although this subject is limited in scope only to network‐layer security.","","9781118736081","10.1002/9781118736074.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821126.pdf&bkn=9820784&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Protocols;Virtualization;Data models;Virtual private networks;Data communication;Computers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The RMA/Transformation is an eminently paradoxical phenomenon, in several respects. It is based on a social discovery of the effects of technology, of which one of the major trials was the Vietnam War and its consequences, which included the second offset strategy, about the planning of American defence. This chapter concentrates on the developments linked to precision and the sometimes paradoxical effects it generates. Weaponry precision is central to the idea of the second offset strategy, the quality should compensate for quantity. States have played the role of technostrategic incubators. On the one hand, this is because they allowed the development of weaponry that is relevant for these techno‐guerrillas, as they are both portable and easy to train users on.","","9781119361350","10.1002/9781119361312.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821502.pdf&bkn=9820803&pdfType=chapter","","Weapons;Gravity;Art;Statistics;Sociology;Drones;Reflection","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Privatization and Economic Exploitation of Personal Data","A. Vitalis",NA,"The Uncertain Digital Revolution","","2016","","","65","85","A report about the digital transformation of the French economy published in November 2014 identified three consequences due to 'datafication': the consequences of automatization, those concerning going paperless and those in terms of intermediation and disintermediation. The estimate of the economic value of personal data is particularly hard to get totally accurate value for and no estimation method is unanimously proposed. Continuing the Schumpeterian concept of innovation understood to be a form of creative destruction, economists distinguish an innovation that does not undermine what already exists but makes it more powerful, and disruptive innovation leads what already exists to disappear, replacing it with a new business model, a new market and a new valuable system. Facebook already has more users than China has inhabitants and the combined wealth of GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) places them at the same level of wealth as Denmark, the 35th largest economy.","","9781119340867","10.1002/9781119341277.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821337.pdf&bkn=9820801&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Internet;Social networking (online);Telematics;Search engines;Sensors;Recording","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Henrotin",NA,"The Art of War in the Network Age: Back to the Future","","2016","","","127","154","This chapter notes that people's relationship to war developed as a function of the consequences of the RMA/Transformation on the way in which war is conducted. The concept of asymmetry underscores the ethnocentrism of the RMA: historically, only the most developed states have ever waged war in a symmetrical/regular way. Irregular war and the procession of ruses, betrayals, misalliances and non‐respect of rules and conventions do not constitute a kind of strategic trickery or militarized deviance. The temporal dimension is essential to the exercise of strategy and this is the case in relation to movement, although less in the geographical sense of displacement than that of the application of armies. Networks play an essential role here because they enhance the two main modes of command historically used by forces, regardless of the level of engagement considered: the command by the plan, and the command by intent, or Auftragstaktik.","","9781119361350","10.1002/9781119361312.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821284.pdf&bkn=9820803&pdfType=chapter","","Geography;Friction;Cognition;Art;Solids;Military systems;Kinematics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The techniques of Operational Analysis, Operational Research and System Analysis appeared successively. As of 1914, Operational Analysis could mathematically determine the main models of combat conduct, giving rise to the “Lanchester laws”, a series of equations never truly demonstrated, which could specify the quantitative parameters of combat that allowed for almost certain victor. Operational Research improves the study of operations using pure and simple mathematics to discover elements of predictability in social organizations, always considering mathematics as the central methodological tool.

Control through records and storing information was established as a byproduct of the automatization of social and public service processing in a country that prides itself on its liberal principles. It is clear that information technology that offers the possibility to record anything can also endanger the security of personal information, while producing an unequivocal entity easily manipulated by those in authority. It is true that the notion of personal privacy is blurred and ever changing, and it is through the attacks it has suffered that its definition has been clarified and enriched.

"Summary","K. Harron; C. Dibben; H. Goldstein",NA; NA; NA,"Methodological Developments in Data Linkage","","2016","","","226","232","The value of data linkage is well accepted, as it promises considerable time and cost advantages over new data collection for large numbers of individuals. This concluding chapter of the book summarises the issues with data linkage methodologies as they exist today, discusses how new developments will address these issues and highlights future areas of research. Where current linkage approaches fail to provide reasonable solutions, new methodologies are crucial for fully exploiting the opportunities presented by data linkage. Traditional forms of analysis may also need to be refined. Looking forward, it may be that advances in data linkage methodologies require and lead to equally innovative developments in the field of statistical methodology. The chapter also speculates on some of the key issues that arise from a future increasingly dominated by linked administrative and transactional data.","","9781119072461","10.1002/9781119072454.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821506.pdf&bkn=9820796&pdfType=chapter","","Couplings;Linked data;Probabilistic logic;Encryption;Uncertainty;Training data;Thesauri","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"A Paradigm Shift","J.

This chapter notes that this ""paradigm shift"" that covers different realities, and presents the risk of only developing the art of warfare under the influence of technologies, independently from strategic knowledge. In a more general way, the “paradigm shift” has an impact on the majority of scopes of the art of war, of international relations and of military sociology. The viewpoint developed by Braillard and Maspoli meets several authors who consider that RMA is a “new operational art”. As they note the weakness of the epistemological rooting of RMA, they also lead the way to a paradigmatic conceptualization of evolutions, on an operative and a tactic level.","","9781119361350","10.1002/9781119361312.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821239.pdf&bkn=9820803&pdfType=chapter","","Art;Military aircraft;Force;Uncertainty;Switches;Sociology;Sensors","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"The Ideology of Human Rights","C.

The movement supporting human rights, which appeared in the constitutions of the 18th Century, became widespread after the Second World War in the context of the creation of the United Nations. The declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen has been a source of inspiration for all those reflecting on human rights in an international context. The universal declaration of human rights, while non‐binding, is referenced by all individuals, physically and morally, who have a direct or indirect attachment to human rights. The right to privacy leads to a similar approach as that of the universal declaration of human rights: there can be no interference with privacy, whether at home, as a violation of the secrecy of correspondence, or as an attack on honor or reputation.","","9781119347323","10.1002/9781119347750.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821481.pdf&bkn=9820802&pdfType=chapter","","IEEE Constitution;Law;Security;Privacy;Presses;Writing;Stress","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Face and gait recognition are types of non-interactive biometric systems as they do not need user cooperation with the surveillance system. Gait recognition is more efficient than face recognition as it can deal with low resolution and brightness images. Gait recognition aims to recognize people based on the way they walk. In this paper, we propose a surveillance system for human identification using a neural network with an enhanced back-propagation algorithm. This neural network is fed with time-varying 1D distance signals calculated from an extracted silhouette sequence. Initially, background modeling is performed for the video sequence. Subsequently, the moving object is being segmented using background subtraction with dynamic thresholding. Then, the neural network is trained with the extracted distance signals. Finally, when the target image sequence is fed, the proposed system extracts features and the identification is performed with the classifier. The proposed system is evaluated using a gait database and it achieves a good recognition performance.","","978-1-5090-5372-8","10.1109/ICCTA40200.2016.9512941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9512941","Gait recognition;Dynamic thresholding;Neural network;Human detection and tracking","Image segmentation;Surveillance;Face recognition;Neural networks;Video sequences;Feature extraction;Image sequences","biometrics (access control);computer vision;face recognition;feature extraction;gait analysis;image motion analysis;image recognition;image segmentation;image sequences","extracted distance signals;gait database;good recognition performance;advanced neural network gait recognition system;dynamic thresholding;noninteractive biometric systems;computer vision researchers;efficient ways;reliable ways;surveillance system;brightness images","","","","19","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These techniques need to consider the large variations in camera motion, viewpoint, cluttered background, etc. Moreover, they need to be unsupervised or weakly supervised to can absorb such amount of different actions. The goal of this paper is to introduce a new unsupervised technique for mining mid-level discriminative patches from videos. These patches are the most representative parts that can describe an action. To achieve this goal, we generalize a technique borrowed from 2D images to generate bounding boxes with high motion and appearance saliencies then apply iterative clustering/classification procedure on generated boxes. Then, we calculate discriminative score for each box and finally select top ranked boxes to train Exemplar-SVM on low-level features extracted inside selected boxes. We evaluate our approach on a challenging dataset namely YouTube and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve better average recognition accuracy than the state-of-the-art techniques.","","978-1-5090-5372-8","10.1109/ICCTA40200.2016.9512942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9512942","","Feature extraction;Cameras;Videos","feature extraction;image classification;image representation;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;pattern clustering;support vector machines","discriminative EdgeBoxes;online videos;action recognition techniques;camera motion;cluttered background;unsupervised technique;mid-level discriminative patches;representative parts;bounding boxes;high motion;appearance saliencies;generated boxes;discriminative score;low-level features;selected boxes","","","","37","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the analysis and testing of such services demands a large amount of effort. To reduce the effort required for web-services testing, in this paper, we propose an event-driven approach to automatically modeling and generating test cases that enable a comfortable fault management leading to a holistic view for multilevel web services composition.

In Egypt and according to its national cancer registry institute, 108,600 have been diagnosed by cancer 66% of them died. Leukemia is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a type of blood cancer that causes the body to produce a large number of white blood cells. In 2012 according to WHO, 352,000 have been diagnosed with leukemia, 75% of them died of it. In 2013, 1125 diagnosed with Myeloid leukemia in Egypt [3]. In this research, FISH (Florescent In Situ Hybridization) images is the key factor of detecting abnormalities in genes. CML can be detected using FISH. CML diagnosis depends on the detection of fused red and green signals. Our approach first detects signals, their colors, and then fusion between these colors. Moreover, number of fusions need to be counted in order to specify the treatment. Our system achieved an accuracy of 98% which proofs the efficiency of the approach.","","978-1-5090-5372-8","10.1109/ICCTA40200.2016.9512938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9512938","Florescent In Situ Hybridization;Chronic Myeloid Leukemia;Signal Fusion;Image Processing","White blood cells;Lymphatic system;Image color analysis;Prototypes;Organizations;Manuals;Fish","blood;bone;cancer;cellular biophysics;patient diagnosis","CML diagnosis;fused red signals;abnormal cells;World Health Organization;national cancer registry institute;blood-forming tissues;blood cancer;white blood cells;chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosis;FISH signal fusion detection","","1","","16","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many activities that are required to manage software systems including maintenance related activities such as handling software bugs. Modern software management techniques mandate efficient scheduling of the executed tasks. Thus, the project manager needs to triage software bugs accurately. To achieve deeper understanding of bugs, we must classify bugs into modern classification categories. In this paper, we will focus on the recognition of high impact bugs. We aim to automate the classification process instead of the manual approach. We will study four thousand issue reports in four open source projects (Ambari, Camel, Derby and Wicket). We suggest making automatic classification in two layers. The first layer is divided into two categories: low-impact bugs and high impact bugs.

XML information retrieval (XML-IR) systems main process is searching XML document fragments relevant to queries from a collection of XML documents. This paper aims at integrating IR and XML search techniques that could enable more sophisticated search on the structure as well as the content of the documents.

Such images need a huge storage disk space and large bandwidth to be transmitted over the network. So, efficient storage and transmission technique is urgent to reduce the required storage capacity and transmission bandwidth. In this paper, an effective and low complexity transmission technique of medical images is proposed. Owing to the fact that in medical images, only a little partition of the image may be diagnostically useful, the medical image contents can be classified into two main parts; one for the region of interest (ROI) and the other for the non-region of interest (NON-ROI). The image containing the ROI is lossless compressed to save the important diagnostically details, while the image containing the remaining part (NON-ROI) is lossy compressed. The lossless compression allows the ROI reconstruction without losing any details. In addition to storage and bandwidth saving, the general compression techniques achieve an attractive level of security that permits secure transmission of the image in the restricted bandwidth over the network. Furthermore, to increase privacy and protect the important data from non-authorized access the region of interest is encrypted using strong encryption technique such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) technique. The encrypted ROI is lossless compressed before transmission after AES encryption process. The decompressed images are fused to reconstruct the entire image, at the receiving end.","","978-1-5090-5372-8","10.1109/ICCTA40200.2016.9512947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9512947","Region of interest (ROI);Non-region of interest (NON-ROI);Lossless compression;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);Haar discrete wavelet transform (HDWT)","Image coding;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computed tomography;Bandwidth;Transforms;Propagation losses;Encryption","biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;cryptography;data compression;image coding;image reconstruction;medical image processing;medical information systems","magnetic resonance imaging;image information;storage disk space;medical image contents;decompressed images;low-complexity transmission technique;computed tomography;Advanced Encryption Standard technique","","","","15","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main idea is to learn a good and adaptive image prior over small image patches. However, expected patch log ikelihood (EPLL) framework achieved a good performance in image restoration applications, it mainly employs the Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) prior over a large number of training patches which gains a huge computational cost. On the other hand, the GMM parameters are learned with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm which usually suffers from local optimum problem. This paper proposes a post filter by extending the EPLL framework to reduce noise in CT images acquired on low radiation dose, in order to get a better quality image with fine details preserved. The basic idea is to incrementally estimate the mixture component parameters to skip over the significant drawback of the (EM) algorithm which greatly depends on the initialization of model parameters. Incremental method with split-merge mixtures learning (SMILE) is utilized for learning mixture models by consecutive split and merge operations. Then, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to select homogeneous patches which tend to cluster together due to the local spatial smoothness in the image. Instead of restoring each patch separately, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is employed to denoise the homogeneous patches selected by ACO algorithm. The proposed method leads to better clustering results and superior denoised results.","","978-1-5090-5372-8","10.1109/ICCTA40200.2016.9513236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513236","Low dose CT denoising;Gaussian mixture model;ant colony optimization;split and merge","Training;Ant colony optimization;Visualization;Statistical analysis;Computed tomography;Noise reduction;Clustering algorithms","computerised tomography;expectation-maximisation algorithm;filtering theory;Gaussian processes;image denoising;image restoration;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;mixture models;optimisation","low dose CT image restoration;incremental learning;patch priors;patch based image restoration tasks;good image;adaptive image;image patches;expected patch log ikelihood framework;image restoration applications;Gaussian Mixture model;huge computational cost;GMM parameters;Expectation Maximization algorithm;local optimum problem;EPLL framework;CT images;low radiation dose;quality image;mixture component parameters;model parameters;incremental method;split-merge mixtures;mixture models;Ant Colony Optimization algorithm;homogeneous patches;ACO algorithm","","","","19","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed technique is intended to reduce the complexity and execution time of the detection process. The main idea is based on splitting the vector of transmitted symbols and the channel matrix into two equal size subsets, where the received symbols detection process will be performed in two separate successive stages. It is proposed to use the SD for the first stage for accurate estimation of the first subset of symbols, which has a critical influence on the next stage performance. Low complexity detectors such as Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) are utilized to estimate the second subset of symbols in order to reduce the complexity. In this case, the SD search in the whole lattice is avoided. Only a half search burden is required which will lead to a significant saving in the computational complexity and time.","","978-1-5090-5372-8","10.1109/ICCTA40200.2016.9513232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513232","Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO);Maximum Likelihood Decoding (MLD);Sphere Decoding (SD)","Lattices;Estimation;Detectors;Mean square error methods;MIMO;Complexity theory;Computational complexity","computational complexity;least mean squares methods;maximum likelihood decoding;maximum likelihood detection;MIMO communication;signal detection","Sphere Decoding;Maximum Likelihood Decoding;execution time;Multiple-Input Multiple-Output systems;hybrid combination;linear detectors;transmitted symbols;channel matrix;equal size subsets;received symbols detection process;SD search;computational complexity;hybrid techniques;low complexity MIMO detection;signal detection","","","","12","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a given image, the rows and columns of the image are summed individually to form two vectors named vertical and horizontal vectors respectively. Then, the subsequent vertical and horizontal vectors are summed once more to form the overall summation vector which reflects the amount of information distribution within the image. The mean of the summation vector is calculated. The intersection of mean line and the summation curve builds up different regions above and beneath the mean line. The areas of these regions are computed separately. The largest area is taken as the sensitive area.

Image-level's adaption means that different images have different characteristics and thus should be considered with different steganographic strategy. In this paper, we propose an optimization strategy to achieve image-level's adaption based on the texture. In the proposed method, we treat different images with individual steganography strategy according to their textures. For each cover image, a bank of Wavelet filters is assessed and the one to achieve the smallest change of the image, with respect of features used in steganalyzer, after embedding the message is adopted.

FeynmanNobel Prize–winning physicist Richard P. Feynman (1918–88) was that rarest of creatures—a towering scientific genius who could make himself understood by anyone and who became as famous for the wit and wisdom of his popular lectures and writings as for his fundamental contributions to science. The Quotable Feynman is a treasure-trove of this revered and beloved scientist's most profound, provocative, humorous, and memorable quotations on a wide range of subjects.Carefully selected by Richard Feynman's daughter, Michelle Feynman, from his spoken and written legacy, including interviews, lectures, letters, articles, and books, the quotations are arranged under two dozen topics—from art, childhood, discovery, family, imagination, and humor to mathematics, politics, science, religion, and uncertainty. These brief passages—about 500 in all—vividly demonstrate Feynman's astonishing yet playful intelligence, and his almost constitutional inability to be anything other than unconventional, engaging, and inspiring. The result is a unique, illuminating, and enjoyable portrait of Feynman's life and thought that will be cherished by his fans at the same time that it provides an ideal introduction to Feynman for readers new to this intriguing and important thinker.The book features a foreword in which physicist Brian Cox pays tribute to Feynman and describes how his words reveal his particular genius, a piece in which cellist Yo-Yo Ma shares his memories of Feynman and reflects on his enduring appeal, and a personal preface by Michelle Feynman.

"Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe","R. Penrose",NA,"Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe","","2016","","","","","Nobel Prize–winning physicist Roger Penrose questions some of the most fashionable ideas in physics today, including string theoryWhat can fashionable ideas, blind faith, or pure fantasy possibly have to do with the scientific quest to understand the universe? Surely, theoretical physicists are immune to mere trends, dogmatic beliefs, or flights of fancy? In fact, acclaimed physicist and bestselling author Roger Penrose argues that researchers working at the extreme frontiers of physics are just as susceptible to these forces as anyone else. In this provocative book, he argues that fashion, faith, and fantasy, while sometimes productive and even essential in physics, may be leading today's researchers astray in three of the field's most important areas—string theory, quantum mechanics, and cosmology.Arguing that string theory has veered away from physical reality by positing six extra hidden dimensions, Penrose cautions that the fashionable nature of a theory can cloud our judgment of its plausibility. In the case of quantum mechanics, its stunning success in explaining the atomic universe has led to an uncritical faith that it must also apply to reasonably massive objects, and Penrose responds by suggesting possible changes in quantum theory. Turning to cosmology, he argues that most of the current fantastical ideas about the origins of the universe cannot be true, but that an even wilder reality may lie behind them. Finally, Penrose describes how fashion, faith, and fantasy have ironically also shaped his own work, from twistor theory, a possible alternative to string theory that is beginning to acquire a fashionable status, to ""conformal cyclic cosmology,"" an idea so fantastic that it could be called ""conformal crazy cosmology.""The result is an important critique of some of the most significant developments in physics today from one of its most eminent figures.","","9781400880287","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452706.pdf&bkn=9452705&pdfType=book","2020 Nobel Prize in physics;2020 Nobel laureates;2020 Nobel laureates in physics;Reinhard Genzel;Andrea Ghez;black holes;general theory of relativity;relativity;general relativity;Albert Einstein;Einstein;Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences;Stockholm","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

With planet hunters finding ever smaller, more Earth-like worlds, our understanding of the cosmos is forever changed, yet the question of how astronomers make these discoveries often goes unanswered.How Do You Find an Exoplanet? is an authoritative primer on the four key techniques that today's planet hunters use to detect the feeble signals of planets orbiting distant stars. John Johnson provides you with an insider’s perspective on this exciting cutting-edge science, showing how astronomers detect the wobble of stars caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet, the slight diminution of light caused by a planet eclipsing its star, and the bending of space-time by stars and their planets, and how astronomers even directly take pictures of planets next to their bright central stars.Accessible to anyone with a basic foundation in college-level physics, How Do You Find an Exoplanet? sheds new light on the prospect of finding life outside our solar system, how surprising new observations suggest that we may not fully understand how planets form, and much more.","","9781400873999","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452356.pdf&bkn=9452355&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"In Praise of Simple Physics: The Science and Mathematics behind Everyday Questions","P. J. Nahin",NA,"In Praise of Simple Physics: The Science and Mathematics behind Everyday Questions","","2016","","","","","Fun puzzles that use physics to explore the wonders of everyday lifePhysics can explain many of the things that we commonly encounter. It can tell us why the night is dark, what causes the tides, and even how best to catch a baseball. With In Praise of Simple Physics, popular math and science writer Paul Nahin presents a plethora of situations that explore the science and math behind the wonders of everyday life. Roaming through a diverse range of puzzles, he illustrates how physics shows us ways to wring more energy from renewable sources, to measure the gravity in our car garages, to figure out which of three light switches in the basement controls the light bulb in the attic, and much, much more.How fast can you travel from London to Paris? How do scientists calculate the energy of an atomic bomb explosion? How do you kick a football so it stays in the air and goes a long way downfield? Nahin begins with simpler problems and progresses to more challenging questions, and his entertaining, accessible, and scientifically and mathematically informed explanations are all punctuated by his trademark humor. Readers are presumed to have some background in beginning differential and integral calculus. Whether you simply have a personal interest in physics' influence in the world or you're an engineering and science student who wants to gain more physics know-how, this book has an intriguing scenario for you.In Praise of Simple Physics proves that if we look carefully at the world around us, physics has answers for the most astonishing day-to-day occurrences.","","9781400880515","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452474.pdf&bkn=9452473&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

"Mathematics in Ancient Egypt: A Contextual History","A. Imhausen",NA,"Mathematics in Ancient Egypt: A Contextual History","","2016","","","","","A survey of ancient Egyptian mathematics across three thousand yearsMathematics in Ancient Egypt traces the development of Egyptian mathematics, from the end of the fourth millennium BC—and the earliest hints of writing and number notation—to the end of the pharaonic period in Greco-Roman times. Drawing from mathematical texts, architectural drawings, administrative documents, and other sources, Annette Imhausen surveys three thousand years of Egyptian history to present an integrated picture of theoretical mathematics in relation to the daily practices of Egyptian life and social structures.Imhausen shows that from the earliest beginnings, pharaonic civilization used numerical techniques to efficiently control and use their material resources and labor. Even during the Old Kingdom, a variety of metrological systems had already been devised. By the Middle Kingdom, procedures had been established to teach mathematical techniques to scribes in order to make them proficient administrators for their king. Imhausen looks at counterparts to the notation of zero, suggests an explanation for the evolution of unit fractions, and analyzes concepts of arithmetic techniques. She draws connections and comparisons to Mesopotamian mathematics, examines which individuals in Egyptian society held mathematical knowledge, and considers which scribes were trained in mathematical ideas and why.Of interest to historians of mathematics, mathematicians, Egyptologists, and all those curious about Egyptian culture, Mathematics in Ancient Egypt sheds new light on a civilization's unique mathematical evolution.","","9781400874309","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452612.pdf&bkn=9452611&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Charting an exciting new direction in the philosophy of mathematics, José Ferreirós uses the crucial idea of a continuum to provide an account of the development of mathematical knowledge that reflects the actual experience of doing math and makes sense of the perceived objectivity of mathematical results.Describing a historically oriented, agent-based philosophy of mathematics, Ferreirós shows how the mathematical tradition evolved from Euclidean geometry to the real numbers and set-theoretic structures. He argues for the need to take into account a whole web of mathematical and other practices that are learned and linked by agents, and whose interplay acts as a constraint. Ferreirós demonstrates how advanced mathematics, far from being a priori, is based on hypotheses, in contrast to elementary math, which has strong cognitive and practical roots and therefore enjoys certainty.Offering a wealth of philosophical and historical insights, Mathematical Knowledge and the Interplay of Practices challenges us to rethink some of our most basic assumptions about mathematics, its objectivity, and its relationship to culture and science.","","9781400874002","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452412.pdf&bkn=9452411&pdfType=book","mathematics;mathematical knowledge;objectivity;practice;agents;Euclidean geometry;real numbers;advanced mathematics;hypotheses;culture;technical practice;mathematical practice;scientific practice;historians;philosophers;Philip S.

"Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment","R. S. Calinger",NA,"Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment","","2016","","","","","An acclaimed biography of the Enlightenment's greatest mathematicianThis is the first full-scale biography of Leonhard Euler (1707–83), one of the greatest mathematicians and theoretical physicists of all time. In this comprehensive and authoritative account, Ronald Calinger connects the story of Euler's eventful life to the astonishing achievements that place him in the company of Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss. Drawing chiefly on Euler’s massive published works and correspondence, which fill more than eighty volumes so far, this biography sets Euler’s work in its multilayered context—personal, intellectual, institutional, political, cultural, religious, and social. It is a story of nearly incessant accomplishment, from Euler’s fundamental contributions to almost every area of pure and applied mathematics—especially calculus, number theory, notation, optics, and celestial, rational, and fluid mechanics—to his advancements in shipbuilding, telescopes, ballistics, cartography, chronology, and music theory.The narrative takes the reader from Euler’s childhood and education in Basel through his first period in St. Petersburg, 1727–41, where he gained a European reputation by solving the Basel problem and systematically developing analytical mechanics. Invited to Berlin by Frederick II, Euler published his famous Introductio in analysin infinitorum, devised continuum mechanics, and proposed a pulse theory of light. Returning to St. Petersburg in 1766, he created the analytical calculus of variations, developed the most precise lunar theory of the time that supported Newton’s dynamics, and published the best-selling Letters to a German Princess—all despite eye problems that ended in near-total blindness. In telling the remarkable story of Euler and how his achievements brought pan-European distinction to the Petersburg and Berlin academies of sciences, the book also demonstrates with new depth and detail the central role of mathematics in the Enlightenment.","","9781400866632","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452454.pdf&bkn=9452453&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

The range of Lebesgue spaces for which these estimates are valid is described in terms of Newton polyhedra associated to the given surface.Isroil Ikromov and Detlef Müller begin with Elias M. Stein's concept of Fourier restriction and some relations between the decay of the Fourier transform of the surface measure and Stein-Tomas type restriction estimates. Varchenko's ideas relating Fourier decay to associated Newton polyhedra are briefly explained, particularly the concept of adapted coordinates and the notion of height. It turns out that these classical tools essentially suffice already to treat the case where there exist linear adapted coordinates, and thus Ikromov and Müller concentrate on the remaining case. Here the notion of r-height is introduced, which proves to be the right new concept. They then describe decomposition techniques and related stopping time algorithms that allow to partition the given surface into various pieces, which can eventually be handled by means of oscillatory integral estimates. Different interpolation techniques are presented and used, from complex to more recent real methods by Bak and Seeger.Fourier restriction plays an important role in several fields, in particular in real and harmonic analysis, number theory, and PDEs.

"Energy Landscapes, Inherent Structures, and Condensed-Matter Phenomena","F. H. Stillinger",NA,"Energy Landscapes, Inherent Structures, and Condensed-Matter Phenomena","","2016","","","","","This book presents an authoritative and in-depth treatment of potential energy landscape theory, a powerful analytical approach to describing the atomic and molecular interactions in condensed-matter phenomena. Drawing on the latest developments in the computational modeling of many-body systems, Frank Stillinger applies this approach to a diverse range of substances and systems, including crystals, liquids, glasses and other amorphous solids, polymers, and solvent-suspended biomolecules.Stillinger focuses on the topography of the multidimensional potential energy hypersurface created when a large number of atoms or molecules simultaneously interact with one another. He explains how the complex landscape topography separates uniquely into individual ""basins,"" each containing a local potential energy minimum or ""inherent structure,"" and he shows how to identify interbasin transition states—saddle points—that reside in shared basin boundaries. Stillinger describes how inherent structures and their basins can be classified and enumerated by depth, curvatures, and other attributes, and how those enumerations lead logically from vastly complicated multidimensional landscapes to properties observed in the real three-dimensional world.Essential for practitioners and students across a variety of fields, the book illustrates how this approach applies equally to systems whose nuclear motions are intrinsically quantum mechanical or classical, and provides novel strategies for numerical simulation computations directed toward diverse condensed-matter systems.","","9781400873975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452714.pdf&bkn=9452713&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

In recent decades, model theory has joined this work through the theory of o-minimality, providing finiteness and uniformity statements and new structural tools.For non-archimedean fields, such as the p-adics, the Berkovich analytification provides a connected topology with many thoroughgoing analogies to the real topology on the set of complex points, and it has become an important tool in algebraic dynamics and many other areas of geometry.This book lays down model-theoretic foundations for non-archimedean geometry. The methods combine o-minimality and stability theory. Definable types play a central role, serving first to define the notion of a point and then properties such as definable compactness.Beyond the foundations, the main theorem constructs a deformation retraction from the full non-archimedean space of an algebraic variety to a rational polytope. This generalizes previous results of V. Berkovich, who used resolution of singularities methods.No previous knowledge of non-archimedean geometry is assumed.

"The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger - Second Edition with a new chapter by the author","M. Levinson",NA,"The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger - Second Edition with a new chapter by the author","","2016","","","","","In April 1956, a refitted oil tanker carried fifty-eight shipping containers from Newark to Houston. From that modest beginning, container shipping developed into a huge industry that made the boom in global trade possible. The Box tells the dramatic story of the container's creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about. But the container didn't just happen. Its adoption required huge sums of money, both from private investors and from ports that aspired to be on the leading edge of a new technology. It required years of high-stakes bargaining with two of the titans of organized labor, Harry Bridges and Teddy Gleason, as well as delicate negotiations on standards that made it possible for almost any container to travel on any truck or train or ship. Ultimately, it took McLean's success in supplying U.S. forces in Vietnam to persuade the world of the container's potential. Drawing on previously neglected sources, economist Marc Levinson shows how the container transformed economic geography, devastating traditional ports such as New York and London and fueling the growth of previously obscure ones, such as Oakland. By making shipping so cheap that industry could locate factories far from its customers, the container paved the way for Asia to become the world's workshop and brought consumers a previously unimaginable variety of low-cost products from around the globe. Published in hardcover on the fiftieth anniversary of the first container voyage, this is the first comprehensive history of the shipping container. Now with a new chapter, The Box tells the dramatic story of how the drive and imagination of an iconoclastic entrepreneur turned containerization from an impractical idea into a phenomenon that transformed economic geography, slashed transportation costs, and made the boom in global trade possible.","","9781400880751","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452648.pdf&bkn=9452647&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"The p-adic Simpson Correspondence (AM-193)","A. Abbes; M. Gros; T. Tsuji",NA; NA; NA,"The p-adic Simpson Correspondence (AM-193)","","2016","","","","","The p-adic Simpson correspondence, recently initiated by Gerd Faltings, aims at describing all p-adic representations of the fundamental group of a proper smooth variety over a p-adic field in terms of linear algebra—namely Higgs bundles. This book undertakes a systematic development of the theory following two new approaches, one by Ahmed Abbes and Michel Gros, the other by Takeshi Tsuji. The authors mainly focus on generalized representations of the fundamental group that are p-adically close to the trivial representation.The first approach relies on a new family of period rings built from the torsor of deformations of the variety over a universal p-adic thickening defined by J. M. Fontaine. The second approach introduces a crystalline-type topos and replaces the notion of Higgs bundles with that of Higgs isocrystals. The authors show the compatibility of the two constructions and the compatibility of the correspondence with the natural cohomologies. The last part of the volume contains results of wider interest in p-adic Hodge theory. The reader will find a concise introduction to Faltings' theory of almost étale extensions and a chapter devoted to the Faltings topos. Though this topos is the general framework for Faltings' approach in p-adic Hodge theory, it remains relatively unexplored. The authors present a new approach based on a generalization of P. Deligne's covanishing topos.","","9781400881239","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452438.pdf&bkn=9452437&pdfType=book","p-adic Simpson correspondence;Gerd Faltings;p-adic field;linear algebra;Higgs bundle;period ring;crystalline-type topos;Higgs isocrystal;p-adic Hodge theory;torsor;deformation;small generalized representation;Faltings ringed topos;Dolbeault module;Dolbeault representation;solvable Higgs module;HiggsДate algebra;Dolbeault generalized representation;Hyodo's theory;HodgeДate structure;Faltings extension;Galois cohomology;small representation;HodgeДate representation;locally irreducible scheme;Koszul complex;additive categories;adic module;cohomology;Higgs bundles;Higgs envelopes;Higgs crystals;fundamental group;overconvergence;Faltings cohomology;almost tale extension;tale cohomology;almost isomorphism;almost flat module;almost faithfully flat module;almost tale covering;almost faithfully flat descent;discrete AЇ-module;Faltings topos;covanishing topos;generalized covanishing topos;morphism;ringed total topos;ringed covanishing topos;finite tale site;Faltings site;inverse limit;tale fundamental group;generalized representation;HodgeДate theory","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

"The Long Thaw: How Humans Are Changing the Next 100,000 Years of Earth’s Climate","D. Archer; D. Archer",NA; NA,"The Long Thaw: How Humans Are Changing the Next 100,000 Years of Earth’s Climate","","2016","","","","","The human impact on Earth's climate is often treated as a hundred-year issue lasting as far into the future as 2100, the year in which most climate projections cease. In The Long Thaw, David Archer, one of the world’s leading climatologists, reveals the hard truth that these changes in climate will be ""locked in,"" essentially forever.If you think that global warming means slightly hotter weather and a modest rise in sea levels that will persist only so long as fossil fuels hold out (or until we decide to stop burning them), think again. In The Long Thaw, David Archer predicts that if we continue to emit carbon dioxide we may eventually cancel the next ice age and raise the oceans by 50 meters. A human-driven, planet-wide thaw has already begun, and will continue to impact Earth’s climate and sea level for hundreds of thousands of years. The great ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland may take more than a century to melt, and the overall change in sea level will be one hundred times what is forecast for 2100. By comparing the global warming projection for the next century to natural climate changes of the distant past, and then looking into the future far beyond the usual scientific and political horizon of the year 2100, Archer reveals the hard truths of the long-term climate forecast. Archer shows how just a few centuries of fossil-fuel use will cause not only a climate storm that will last a few hundred years, but dramatic climate changes that will last thousands. Carbon dioxide emitted today will be a problem for millennia. For the first time, humans have become major players in shaping the long-term climate. In fact, a planetwide thaw driven by humans has already begun. But despite the seriousness of the situation, Archer argues that it is still not too late to avert dangerous climate change--if humans can find a way to cooperate as never before. Revealing why carbon dioxide may be an even worse gamble in the long run than in the short, this compelling and critically important book brings the best long-term climate science to a general audience for the first time. With a new preface that discusses recent advances in climate science, and the impact on global warming and climate change, The Long Thaw shows that it is still not too late to avert dangerous climate change—if we can find a way to cooperate as never before.","","9781400880775","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452420.pdf&bkn=9452419&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"The Cosmic Web: Mysterious Architecture of the Universe","J. R. Gott",NA,"The Cosmic Web: Mysterious Architecture of the Universe","","2016","","","","","A gripping first-person account of how scientists came to understand our universe's mysterious structureJ. Richard Gott was among the first cosmologists to propose that the structure of our universe is like a sponge made up of clusters of galaxies intricately connected by filaments of galaxies—a magnificent structure now called the ""cosmic web"" and mapped extensively by teams of astronomers. Here is his gripping insider's account of how a generation of undaunted theorists and observers solved the mystery of the architecture of our cosmos.The Cosmic Web begins with modern pioneers of extragalactic astronomy, such as Edwin Hubble and Fritz Zwicky. It goes on to describe how, during the Cold War, the American school of cosmology favored a model of the universe where galaxies resided in isolated clusters, whereas the Soviet school favored a honeycomb pattern of galaxies punctuated by giant, isolated voids. Gott tells the stories of how his own path to a solution began with a high-school science project when he was eighteen, and how he and astronomer Mario Jurič measured the Sloan Great Wall of Galaxies, a filament of galaxies that, at 1.37 billion light-years in length, is one of the largest structures in the universe.Drawing on Gott’s own experiences working at the frontiers of science with many of today’s leading cosmologists, The Cosmic Web shows how ambitious telescope surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are transforming our understanding of the cosmos, and how the cosmic web holds vital clues to the origins of the universe and the next trillion years that lie ahead.","","9781400873289","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453310.pdf&bkn=9453309&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

The authors then put their algebraic solution into a geometric context by developing a general fixed point theory for groups acting on buildings of arbitrary type, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the residues fixed by a group to form a kind of subbuilding or ""form"" of the original building. At the center of this theory is the notion of a Tits index, a combinatorial version of the notion of an index in the relative theory of algebraic groups. These results are combined at the end to show that every exceptional Bruhat-Tits building arises as a form of a ""residually pseudo-split"" Bruhat-Tits building. The book concludes with a display of the Tits indices associated with each of these exceptional forms.This is the third and final volume of a trilogy that began with Richard Weiss' The Structure of Spherical Buildings and The Structure of Affine Buildings.","","9781400874019","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452508.pdf&bkn=9452507&pdfType=book","building;Bruhat-Tits building;Tits index;fixed point theory;algebraic group;subbuilding;pseudo-split building;Moufang polygon;Coxeter group;root;residue;projection map;Moufang building;spherical building;simplicial complex;quadratic form;polar space;quadratic module;quadratic space;hyperbolic quadratic module;hyperbolic quadratic space;hyperbolic plane;split quadratic space;round quadratic space;root group sequence;isomorphism;anti-isomorphism;anisotropic quadratic space;generalized quadrangle;proper indifferent set;Moufang quadrangle;anisotropic pseudo-quadratic space;proper involutory set;abelian group;non-abelian group;quaternion division algebra;Moufang set;weak isomorphism;involutory set;biquaternion division algebra;standard involution;discrete valuation;residual quadratic spaces;finite dimension;bilinear form;unramified quadratic space;separable quadratic extension;vector space;scalar multiplication;exceptional quadrangle;apartment;Euclidean plane;affine building;unramified quadrangle;semi-ramified quadrangle;ramified quadrangle;isotropic quadratic space;wild quadratic space;Clifford invariant;trace;trace map;Pfister form;Structure Theorem;unramified separable quadratic extension;tamely ramified division algebra;ramified separable quadratic extension;unramified quaternion division algebra;ramified quaternion division algebra;exceptional Moufang quadrangle;Coxeter diagram;vertex;gem;special vertex;pseudo-quadratic space;descent;length function;Coxeter system;automorphism;canonical isomorphism;arctic region;relative Coxeter diagram;compatible representation;absolute Coxeter system;relative Coxeter system;relative Coxeter group;absolute Coxeter diagram;absolute rank;relative rank;parallel residues;chamber;descent group;Fundamental Theorem of Descent;thick building;fixed point building;subbuilding of split type;thin T-building;Moufang structure;Moufang condition","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs).

It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227934.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

With the emergence of the web as the predominant and converging platform for communication, business and scholastic information dissemination, especially in the last five years, there are ever increasing research groups working on different aspects of web mining mainly in three directions. These are: mining of web content, web structure and web usage. In this context there are good number of frameworks and benchmarks related to the metrics of the websites which is certainly weighty for B2B, B2C and in general in any e-commerce paradigm. Owing to the popularity of this topic there are few books in the market, dealing more on such performance metrics and other related issues. This book, however, omits all such routine topics and lays more emphasis on the classification and clustering aspects of the websites in order to come out with the true perception of the websites in light of its usability. In nutshell, Web Mining: A Synergic Approach Resorting to Classifications and Clustering showcases an effective methodology for classification and clustering of web sites from their usability point of view. While the clustering and classification is accomplished by using an open source tool WEKA, the basic dataset for the selected websites has been emanated by using a free tool site-analyzer. As a case study, several commercial websites have been analyzed. The dataset preparation using site-analyzer and classification through WEKA by embedding different algorithms is one of the unique selling points of this book. This text projects a complete spectrum of web mining from its very inception through data mining and takes the reader up to the application level. Salient features of the book include: • Literature review of research work in the area of web mining • Business websites domain researched, and data collected using site-analyzer tool • Accessibility, design, text, multimedia, and networking are assessed • Datasets are filtered further by selecting vital attributes which are Search Engine Optimized for processing using the Weka attributed tool • Dataset with labels have been classified using J48, RBFNetwork, NaïveBayes, and SMO techniques using Weka • A comparative analysis of all classifiers is reported • Commercial applications for improving website performance based on SEO is given","","9788793379848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228042.pdf&bkn=9218887&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227884.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Only in this way is it possible to improve the quality of life. Seen in this way, sustainable development is understood to be people centred. We have a special concern with cultural, social and economic dimensions, where individuals can develop, together as a society, whilst at the same time individual and organizational activities can be implemented without destroying the present diversity and complexity of the ecological system where we live. Taking into account these concerns, this book looks to cover issues related to the management for sustainable development in a context where organizations are continually facing high challenges for what concerns the items related to, amongst others, the re-use, recycling, waste reduction, add value, low costs and time of production, sustainable behaviour, not only in an environmental perspective but also in an organizational perspective. Today’s organizations can no longer develop their practices based in the existent paradigms. On the contrary, it is necessary to completely break from these paradigms, creating a total change of mentality in the way we manage the organizational activities. Taking into account this reality, managing for a sustainable development appears as a management philosophy focused in productivity improvement considering different kinds of goals, such as biological, economic and social systems goals. Conscious of this reality, this book contributes to the exchange of experiences and perspectives about the state of research related to the management for a sustainable development, as well as the future direction of this research field.

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227908.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing.

"6 Preliminary Tasks in Research Supervision","D.

It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227832.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"3 Sustainable Business as a Strategy","A. Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","45","70","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228095.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","i","xxv","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip.

Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","17","44","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228044.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227938.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228028.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"10 System-Level Design Space Exploration for Dedicated Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","173","198","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227878.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227937.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

With the emergence of the web as the predominant and converging platform for communication, business and scholastic information dissemination, especially in the last five years, there are ever increasing research groups working on different aspects of web mining mainly in three directions. These are: mining of web content, web structure and web usage. In this context there are good number of frameworks and benchmarks related to the metrics of the websites which is certainly weighty for B2B, B2C and in general in any e-commerce paradigm. Owing to the popularity of this topic there are few books in the market, dealing more on such performance metrics and other related issues. This book, however, omits all such routine topics and lays more emphasis on the classification and clustering aspects of the websites in order to come out with the true perception of the websites in light of its usability. In nutshell, Web Mining: A Synergic Approach Resorting to Classifications and Clustering showcases an effective methodology for classification and clustering of web sites from their usability point of view. While the clustering and classification is accomplished by using an open source tool WEKA, the basic dataset for the selected websites has been emanated by using a free tool site-analyzer. As a case study, several commercial websites have been analyzed. The dataset preparation using site-analyzer and classification through WEKA by embedding different algorithms is one of the unique selling points of this book. This text projects a complete spectrum of web mining from its very inception through data mining and takes the reader up to the application level. Salient features of the book include: • Literature review of research work in the area of web mining • Business websites domain researched, and data collected using site-analyzer tool • Accessibility, design, text, multimedia, and networking are assessed • Datasets are filtered further by selecting vital attributes which are Search Engine Optimized for processing using the Weka attributed tool • Dataset with labels have been classified using J48, RBFNetwork, NaïveBayes, and SMO techniques using Weka • A comparative analysis of all classifiers is reported • Commercial applications for improving website performance based on SEO is given","","9788793379848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228053.pdf&bkn=9218887&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227968.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems. The textbook includes a wealth of problems, with solutions • Worked-out examples have been included to explain new and difficult concepts, which help to expose the reader to real-life signal processing problems • The inclusion of FIR and IIR filter design further enrich the contents","","9788793379398","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227836.pdf&bkn=9218838&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"11 SystemC-Based ESL Design Space Exploration for Dedicated Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","199","222","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227929.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"2 Understanding the Fundamental Outcomes of Research Supervision","D. Toncich",NA,"Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision A Guide for Supervisors","","2016","","","15","54","Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision - A Guide for Supervisors is designed to inform and support university academics and researchers who are taking on the responsibilities of postgraduate research student supervision. It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227838.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227831.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"1 The Urgent Necessity to Redouble Renewable Energy Output","",,"Renewable Energy; a Status Quo","","2016","","","1","38","It is evident to all that climate change is happening – the results can be seen in many countries. Floods, freaks storms, wind speeds of more than 80 mph, heat waves, droughts, rising sea levels and disappearing glaciers, largely due to excessive use of fossil fuels. Climate change acceleration began slowly in the 1970s but has now increased beyond our ability to stop it or reduce its impact. Using renewable energy effectively on a large scale will put an end or considerably slow down this process in many parts of the world. This book shows that some countries are making greater efforts than others. Installations of the 70s and 80s were limited to kilowatts while in the 2010s we speak in terms of megawatts. The cost of most renewable energy systems have been reduced by so much that they have reached parity with fossil fuels, or are even cheaper. The most effective progress has been made in photovoltaic systems, whilst concentrated solar power, biomass, wind energy and hydro-power have greatly improved payback periods too. While much is hoped from the outcome of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, realistically in the past very few nations honoured their pledges. A great deal of aid has been given to poor countries which are suffering from climate change, however the donor nations have failed to restrict their own carbon emissions. Many poor countries feel they are being expected to forgo the industrial benefits which came from the industrial revolution powered by fossil fuels. The book will outline the achievements of renewable energy by the end of 2015 / beginning of 2016.","","9788793379497","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227875.pdf&bkn=9218906&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"14 The Long Term Supervisor/Researcher Relationship","D. Toncich",NA,"Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision A Guide for Supervisors","","2016","","","285","302","Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision - A Guide for Supervisors is designed to inform and support university academics and researchers who are taking on the responsibilities of postgraduate research student supervision. It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227879.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"7 System-Level Partitioning","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","123","138","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227953.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","101","118","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228070.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227909.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"3 Reinventing Geothermal Energy","",,"Renewable Energy; a Status Quo","","2016","","","55","62","It is evident to all that climate change is happening – the results can be seen in many countries. Floods, freaks storms, wind speeds of more than 80 mph, heat waves, droughts, rising sea levels and disappearing glaciers, largely due to excessive use of fossil fuels. Climate change acceleration began slowly in the 1970s but has now increased beyond our ability to stop it or reduce its impact. Using renewable energy effectively on a large scale will put an end or considerably slow down this process in many parts of the world. This book shows that some countries are making greater efforts than others. Installations of the 70s and 80s were limited to kilowatts while in the 2010s we speak in terms of megawatts. The cost of most renewable energy systems have been reduced by so much that they have reached parity with fossil fuels, or are even cheaper. The most effective progress has been made in photovoltaic systems, whilst concentrated solar power, biomass, wind energy and hydro-power have greatly improved payback periods too. While much is hoped from the outcome of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, realistically in the past very few nations honoured their pledges. A great deal of aid has been given to poor countries which are suffering from climate change, however the donor nations have failed to restrict their own carbon emissions. Many poor countries feel they are being expected to forgo the industrial benefits which came from the industrial revolution powered by fossil fuels. The book will outline the achievements of renewable energy by the end of 2015 / beginning of 2016.","","9788793379497","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227911.pdf&bkn=9218906&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems. The textbook includes a wealth of problems, with solutions • Worked-out examples have been included to explain new and difficult concepts, which help to expose the reader to real-life signal processing problems • The inclusion of FIR and IIR filter design further enrich the contents","","9788793379398","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227824.pdf&bkn=9218838&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"5 Metrics for Co-Analysis","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","63","84","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227926.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Conscious of the environment where we live everybody looks to find the best solutions to solve problems that result from Human Being evolution. Management for a sustainable development appears as a process from which organizations try to use all its resources, as well as improve its organizational and technological development, in order to answer not only to the present but also to future human and social needs. Only in this way is it possible to improve the quality of life. Seen in this way, sustainable development is understood to be people centred. We have a special concern with cultural, social and economic dimensions, where individuals can develop, together as a society, whilst at the same time individual and organizational activities can be implemented without destroying the present diversity and complexity of the ecological system where we live. Taking into account these concerns, this book looks to cover issues related to the management for sustainable development in a context where organizations are continually facing high challenges for what concerns the items related to, amongst others, the re-use, recycling, waste reduction, add value, low costs and time of production, sustainable behaviour, not only in an environmental perspective but also in an organizational perspective. Today’s organizations can no longer develop their practices based in the existent paradigms. On the contrary, it is necessary to completely break from these paradigms, creating a total change of mentality in the way we manage the organizational activities. Taking into account this reality, managing for a sustainable development appears as a management philosophy focused in productivity improvement considering different kinds of goals, such as biological, economic and social systems goals. Conscious of this reality, this book contributes to the exchange of experiences and perspectives about the state of research related to the management for a sustainable development, as well as the future direction of this research field.

With the emergence of the web as the predominant and converging platform for communication, business and scholastic information dissemination, especially in the last five years, there are ever increasing research groups working on different aspects of web mining mainly in three directions. These are: mining of web content, web structure and web usage. In this context there are good number of frameworks and benchmarks related to the metrics of the websites which is certainly weighty for B2B, B2C and in general in any e-commerce paradigm.

"6 Reshaping TraditionalWays of Learning","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","157","196","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally. It also showcases the strategies, tools, and tactical execution on how create cultural change in all parts of the world.","","9788793379671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228580.pdf&bkn=9218770&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227936.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Summary","J. F. M. Gerrits",NA,"Wideband FM Techniques for Low-Power Wireless Communications","","2016","","","179","182","Ultra Wideband (UWB) communications are poised to enable short-range applications, such as remote health monitoring (e-health) and home or office automation. Sensor networks are also suitable candidates for UWB since the low radiated power of the UWB transmitter enables low DC power consumption, yielding long battery life and the possibility to use energy scavenging. Size and cost constraints require a low-complexity approach that allows multiple users to share the same RF bandwidth, and offers robustness to interference, frequency-selective multipath and antenna mismatch. Wideband FM Techniques for Low-Power Wireless Communications presents research and applications that have taken place in UWB Communications over the past years. This book is being published posthumously in agreement with the authors’ former colleagues from both the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) and Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands.","","9788793379619","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228663.pdf&bkn=9218789&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227871.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

With the emergence of the web as the predominant and converging platform for communication, business and scholastic information dissemination, especially in the last five years, there are ever increasing research groups working on different aspects of web mining mainly in three directions. These are: mining of web content, web structure and web usage. In this context there are good number of frameworks and benchmarks related to the metrics of the websites which is certainly weighty for B2B, B2C and in general in any e-commerce paradigm. Owing to the popularity of this topic there are few books in the market, dealing more on such performance metrics and other related issues. This book, however, omits all such routine topics and lays more emphasis on the classification and clustering aspects of the websites in order to come out with the true perception of the websites in light of its usability. In nutshell, Web Mining: A Synergic Approach Resorting to Classifications and Clustering showcases an effective methodology for classification and clustering of web sites from their usability point of view. While the clustering and classification is accomplished by using an open source tool WEKA, the basic dataset for the selected websites has been emanated by using a free tool site-analyzer. As a case study, several commercial websites have been analyzed. The dataset preparation using site-analyzer and classification through WEKA by embedding different algorithms is one of the unique selling points of this book. This text projects a complete spectrum of web mining from its very inception through data mining and takes the reader up to the application level. Salient features of the book include: • Literature review of research work in the area of web mining • Business websites domain researched, and data collected using site-analyzer tool • Accessibility, design, text, multimedia, and networking are assessed • Datasets are filtered further by selecting vital attributes which are Search Engine Optimized for processing using the Weka attributed tool • Dataset with labels have been classified using J48, RBFNetwork, NaïveBayes, and SMO techniques using Weka • A comparative analysis of all classifiers is reported • Commercial applications for improving website performance based on SEO is given","","9788793379848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228102.pdf&bkn=9218887&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","221","222","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs).

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures.

This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs).

"8 System-Level Co-Simulation","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","139","158","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227964.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"5 Decent Employment Opportunities in Global Value Chains: The Case of the Textile and Clothing Sector","",,"Management for Sustainable Development","","2016","","","125","148","Today, increasingly more, the word sustainability is present in all kinds of discussions: at home, at work, at school, in all society. Conscious of the environment where we live everybody looks to find the best solutions to solve problems that result from Human Being evolution. Management for a sustainable development appears as a process from which organizations try to use all its resources, as well as improve its organizational and technological development, in order to answer not only to the present but also to future human and social needs. Only in this way is it possible to improve the quality of life. Seen in this way, sustainable development is understood to be people centred. We have a special concern with cultural, social and economic dimensions, where individuals can develop, together as a society, whilst at the same time individual and organizational activities can be implemented without destroying the present diversity and complexity of the ecological system where we live. Taking into account these concerns, this book looks to cover issues related to the management for sustainable development in a context where organizations are continually facing high challenges for what concerns the items related to, amongst others, the re-use, recycling, waste reduction, add value, low costs and time of production, sustainable behaviour, not only in an environmental perspective but also in an organizational perspective. Today’s organizations can no longer develop their practices based in the existent paradigms. On the contrary, it is necessary to completely break from these paradigms, creating a total change of mentality in the way we manage the organizational activities. Taking into account this reality, managing for a sustainable development appears as a management philosophy focused in productivity improvement considering different kinds of goals, such as biological, economic and social systems goals. Conscious of this reality, this book contributes to the exchange of experiences and perspectives about the state of research related to the management for a sustainable development, as well as the future direction of this research field. It looks to provide a support to academics and researchers, as well as those operating in the management field and who need to deal with policies and strategies related to sustainable development issues.","","9788793379091","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227763.pdf&bkn=9218816&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems.

"1 Introduction","V. S. Kumbhar; K. S. Oza; R. K. Kamat",NA; NA; NA,"Web Mining: A Synergic Approach Resorting to Classifications and Clustering","","2016","","","1","37","Web mining is the application of data mining strategies to excerpt learning from web information, i.e. web content, web structure, and web usage data. With the emergence of the web as the predominant and converging platform for communication, business and scholastic information dissemination, especially in the last five years, there are ever increasing research groups working on different aspects of web mining mainly in three directions. These are: mining of web content, web structure and web usage. In this context there are good number of frameworks and benchmarks related to the metrics of the websites which is certainly weighty for B2B, B2C and in general in any e-commerce paradigm. Owing to the popularity of this topic there are few books in the market, dealing more on such performance metrics and other related issues. This book, however, omits all such routine topics and lays more emphasis on the classification and clustering aspects of the websites in order to come out with the true perception of the websites in light of its usability. In nutshell, Web Mining: A Synergic Approach Resorting to Classifications and Clustering showcases an effective methodology for classification and clustering of web sites from their usability point of view. While the clustering and classification is accomplished by using an open source tool WEKA, the basic dataset for the selected websites has been emanated by using a free tool site-analyzer. As a case study, several commercial websites have been analyzed. The dataset preparation using site-analyzer and classification through WEKA by embedding different algorithms is one of the unique selling points of this book. This text projects a complete spectrum of web mining from its very inception through data mining and takes the reader up to the application level. Salient features of the book include: • Literature review of research work in the area of web mining • Business websites domain researched, and data collected using site-analyzer tool • Accessibility, design, text, multimedia, and networking are assessed • Datasets are filtered further by selecting vital attributes which are Search Engine Optimized for processing using the Weka attributed tool • Dataset with labels have been classified using J48, RBFNetwork, NaïveBayes, and SMO techniques using Weka • A comparative analysis of all classifiers is reported • Commercial applications for improving website performance based on SEO is given","","9788793379848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228072.pdf&bkn=9218887&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"Afterword","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","323","334","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally. It also showcases the strategies, tools, and tactical execution on how create cultural change in all parts of the world.","","9788793379671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228604.pdf&bkn=9218770&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","245","246","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures.

"About the Editor","",,"Renewable Energy; a Status Quo","","2016","","","173","174","It is evident to all that climate change is happening – the results can be seen in many countries. Floods, freaks storms, wind speeds of more than 80 mph, heat waves, droughts, rising sea levels and disappearing glaciers, largely due to excessive use of fossil fuels. Climate change acceleration began slowly in the 1970s but has now increased beyond our ability to stop it or reduce its impact. Using renewable energy effectively on a large scale will put an end or considerably slow down this process in many parts of the world. This book shows that some countries are making greater efforts than others. Installations of the 70s and 80s were limited to kilowatts while in the 2010s we speak in terms of megawatts. The cost of most renewable energy systems have been reduced by so much that they have reached parity with fossil fuels, or are even cheaper. The most effective progress has been made in photovoltaic systems, whilst concentrated solar power, biomass, wind energy and hydro-power have greatly improved payback periods too. While much is hoped from the outcome of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, realistically in the past very few nations honoured their pledges. A great deal of aid has been given to poor countries which are suffering from climate change, however the donor nations have failed to restrict their own carbon emissions. Many poor countries feel they are being expected to forgo the industrial benefits which came from the industrial revolution powered by fossil fuels. The book will outline the achievements of renewable energy by the end of 2015 / beginning of 2016.","","9788793379497","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227880.pdf&bkn=9218906&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing.

"4 Mentoring Investors and Entrepreneurs","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","99","118","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally. It also showcases the strategies, tools, and tactical execution on how create cultural change in all parts of the world.","","9788793379671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228635.pdf&bkn=9218770&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"4 FromWaste to Energy: Development and Use of Renewable Energy in Sewage Treatment Facilities in Hong Kong","",,"Renewable Energy; a Status Quo","","2016","","","63","72","It is evident to all that climate change is happening – the results can be seen in many countries. Floods, freaks storms, wind speeds of more than 80 mph, heat waves, droughts, rising sea levels and disappearing glaciers, largely due to excessive use of fossil fuels. Climate change acceleration began slowly in the 1970s but has now increased beyond our ability to stop it or reduce its impact. Using renewable energy effectively on a large scale will put an end or considerably slow down this process in many parts of the world. This book shows that some countries are making greater efforts than others. Installations of the 70s and 80s were limited to kilowatts while in the 2010s we speak in terms of megawatts. The cost of most renewable energy systems have been reduced by so much that they have reached parity with fossil fuels, or are even cheaper. The most effective progress has been made in photovoltaic systems, whilst concentrated solar power, biomass, wind energy and hydro-power have greatly improved payback periods too. While much is hoped from the outcome of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, realistically in the past very few nations honoured their pledges. A great deal of aid has been given to poor countries which are suffering from climate change, however the donor nations have failed to restrict their own carbon emissions. Many poor countries feel they are being expected to forgo the industrial benefits which came from the industrial revolution powered by fossil fuels. The book will outline the achievements of renewable energy by the end of 2015 / beginning of 2016.","","9788793379497","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227850.pdf&bkn=9218906&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227886.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Management for Sustainable Development","",,"Management for Sustainable Development","","2016","","","i","xviii","Today, increasingly more, the word sustainability is present in all kinds of discussions: at home, at work, at school, in all society. Conscious of the environment where we live everybody looks to find the best solutions to solve problems that result from Human Being evolution. Management for a sustainable development appears as a process from which organizations try to use all its resources, as well as improve its organizational and technological development, in order to answer not only to the present but also to future human and social needs. Only in this way is it possible to improve the quality of life. Seen in this way, sustainable development is understood to be people centred. We have a special concern with cultural, social and economic dimensions, where individuals can develop, together as a society, whilst at the same time individual and organizational activities can be implemented without destroying the present diversity and complexity of the ecological system where we live. Taking into account these concerns, this book looks to cover issues related to the management for sustainable development in a context where organizations are continually facing high challenges for what concerns the items related to, amongst others, the re-use, recycling, waste reduction, add value, low costs and time of production, sustainable behaviour, not only in an environmental perspective but also in an organizational perspective. Today’s organizations can no longer develop their practices based in the existent paradigms. On the contrary, it is necessary to completely break from these paradigms, creating a total change of mentality in the way we manage the organizational activities. Taking into account this reality, managing for a sustainable development appears as a management philosophy focused in productivity improvement considering different kinds of goals, such as biological, economic and social systems goals. Conscious of this reality, this book contributes to the exchange of experiences and perspectives about the state of research related to the management for a sustainable development, as well as the future direction of this research field. It looks to provide a support to academics and researchers, as well as those operating in the management field and who need to deal with policies and strategies related to sustainable development issues.","","9788793379091","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227727.pdf&bkn=9218816&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"9 Stories of Resilience, Perseverance, and Staying on Top of Technology Trends","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","233","258","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally. It also showcases the strategies, tools, and tactical execution on how create cultural change in all parts of the world.","","9788793379671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228630.pdf&bkn=9218770&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227959.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"References","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","223","238","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227960.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"4 The Relationship between the Supervisor and the Student","D. Toncich",NA,"Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision A Guide for Supervisors","","2016","","","79","94","Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision - A Guide for Supervisors is designed to inform and support university academics and researchers who are taking on the responsibilities of postgraduate research student supervision. It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227931.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In this book reconfigurable computing with FPGAs is discussed as an alternative to multi-core processing and graphics card accelerators. Instead of adjusting the application to the hardware, FPGAs allow the hardware to also be adjusted to the problem. Acceleration of Biomedical Image Processing with Dataflow on FPGAs covers the transformation of image processing algorithms towards a system of deep pipelines that can be executed with very high parallelism. The transformation process is discussed from initial design decisions to working implementations. Two example applications from stochastic localization microscopy and electron tomography illustrate the approach further.

"7 EducatingWomen in Post-Conflict Zones","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","197","216","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention.

"7 Integrating CSR in R&D","A. Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","119","132","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228024.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In this book reconfigurable computing with FPGAs is discussed as an alternative to multi-core processing and graphics card accelerators. Instead of adjusting the application to the hardware, FPGAs allow the hardware to also be adjusted to the problem. Acceleration of Biomedical Image Processing with Dataflow on FPGAs covers the transformation of image processing algorithms towards a system of deep pipelines that can be executed with very high parallelism. The transformation process is discussed from initial design decisions to working implementations. Two example applications from stochastic localization microscopy and electron tomography illustrate the approach further.

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227859.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems. The textbook includes a wealth of problems, with solutions • Worked-out examples have been included to explain new and difficult concepts, which help to expose the reader to real-life signal processing problems • The inclusion of FIR and IIR filter design further enrich the contents","","9788793379398","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227867.pdf&bkn=9218838&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Toncich",NA,"Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision A Guide for Supervisors","","2016","","","221","262","Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision - A Guide for Supervisors is designed to inform and support university academics and researchers who are taking on the responsibilities of postgraduate research student supervision. It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227825.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"Index","",,"Renewable Energy; a Status Quo","","2016","","","169","172","It is evident to all that climate change is happening – the results can be seen in many countries. Floods, freaks storms, wind speeds of more than 80 mph, heat waves, droughts, rising sea levels and disappearing glaciers, largely due to excessive use of fossil fuels. Climate change acceleration began slowly in the 1970s but has now increased beyond our ability to stop it or reduce its impact. Using renewable energy effectively on a large scale will put an end or considerably slow down this process in many parts of the world. This book shows that some countries are making greater efforts than others. Installations of the 70s and 80s were limited to kilowatts while in the 2010s we speak in terms of megawatts. The cost of most renewable energy systems have been reduced by so much that they have reached parity with fossil fuels, or are even cheaper. The most effective progress has been made in photovoltaic systems, whilst concentrated solar power, biomass, wind energy and hydro-power have greatly improved payback periods too. While much is hoped from the outcome of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, realistically in the past very few nations honoured their pledges. A great deal of aid has been given to poor countries which are suffering from climate change, however the donor nations have failed to restrict their own carbon emissions. Many poor countries feel they are being expected to forgo the industrial benefits which came from the industrial revolution powered by fossil fuels. The book will outline the achievements of renewable energy by the end of 2015 / beginning of 2016.","","9788793379497","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227847.pdf&bkn=9218906&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Kamat",NA; NA; NA,"Web Mining: A Synergic Approach Resorting to Classifications and Clustering","","2016","","","55","88","Web mining is the application of data mining strategies to excerpt learning from web information, i.e. web content, web structure, and web usage data. With the emergence of the web as the predominant and converging platform for communication, business and scholastic information dissemination, especially in the last five years, there are ever increasing research groups working on different aspects of web mining mainly in three directions. These are: mining of web content, web structure and web usage. In this context there are good number of frameworks and benchmarks related to the metrics of the websites which is certainly weighty for B2B, B2C and in general in any e-commerce paradigm. Owing to the popularity of this topic there are few books in the market, dealing more on such performance metrics and other related issues. This book, however, omits all such routine topics and lays more emphasis on the classification and clustering aspects of the websites in order to come out with the true perception of the websites in light of its usability. In nutshell, Web Mining: A Synergic Approach Resorting to Classifications and Clustering showcases an effective methodology for classification and clustering of web sites from their usability point of view. While the clustering and classification is accomplished by using an open source tool WEKA, the basic dataset for the selected websites has been emanated by using a free tool site-analyzer. As a case study, several commercial websites have been analyzed. The dataset preparation using site-analyzer and classification through WEKA by embedding different algorithms is one of the unique selling points of this book. This text projects a complete spectrum of web mining from its very inception through data mining and takes the reader up to the application level. Salient features of the book include: • Literature review of research work in the area of web mining • Business websites domain researched, and data collected using site-analyzer tool • Accessibility, design, text, multimedia, and networking are assessed • Datasets are filtered further by selecting vital attributes which are Search Engine Optimized for processing using the Weka attributed tool • Dataset with labels have been classified using J48, RBFNetwork, NaïveBayes, and SMO techniques using Weka • A comparative analysis of all classifiers is reported • Commercial applications for improving website performance based on SEO is given","","9788793379848","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228837.pdf&bkn=9218887&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","179","184","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227997.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Editor's Biographies","",,"Management for Sustainable Development","","2016","","","167","188","Today, increasingly more, the word sustainability is present in all kinds of discussions: at home, at work, at school, in all society. Conscious of the environment where we live everybody looks to find the best solutions to solve problems that result from Human Being evolution. Management for a sustainable development appears as a process from which organizations try to use all its resources, as well as improve its organizational and technological development, in order to answer not only to the present but also to future human and social needs. Only in this way is it possible to improve the quality of life. Seen in this way, sustainable development is understood to be people centred. We have a special concern with cultural, social and economic dimensions, where individuals can develop, together as a society, whilst at the same time individual and organizational activities can be implemented without destroying the present diversity and complexity of the ecological system where we live. Taking into account these concerns, this book looks to cover issues related to the management for sustainable development in a context where organizations are continually facing high challenges for what concerns the items related to, amongst others, the re-use, recycling, waste reduction, add value, low costs and time of production, sustainable behaviour, not only in an environmental perspective but also in an organizational perspective. Today’s organizations can no longer develop their practices based in the existent paradigms. On the contrary, it is necessary to completely break from these paradigms, creating a total change of mentality in the way we manage the organizational activities. Taking into account this reality, managing for a sustainable development appears as a management philosophy focused in productivity improvement considering different kinds of goals, such as biological, economic and social systems goals. Conscious of this reality, this book contributes to the exchange of experiences and perspectives about the state of research related to the management for a sustainable development, as well as the future direction of this research field. It looks to provide a support to academics and researchers, as well as those operating in the management field and who need to deal with policies and strategies related to sustainable development issues.","","9788793379091","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227759.pdf&bkn=9218816&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227921.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"11 Peer Review by Publication","D. Toncich",NA,"Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision A Guide for Supervisors","","2016","","","213","220","Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision - A Guide for Supervisors is designed to inform and support university academics and researchers who are taking on the responsibilities of postgraduate research student supervision. It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227966.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","217","221","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228069.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems.

"8 Opportunities for Adult Learners","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","217","232","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally. It also showcases the strategies, tools, and tactical execution on how create cultural change in all parts of the world.","","9788793379671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228579.pdf&bkn=9218770&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Based on the these findings, this book shows the development of a class-AB current-mode sample-and-hold circuit with an order of magnitude improvement in its figure of merit compared to other state-of-the-art designs. Also, the concepts and design procedures of 1) single-branch filters 2) follower-integrator-based lowpass filters and 3) modular transconductance reduction techniques for very low frequency filters are presented. Finally, to serve the requirement of a very large signal swing in an energy-based action potential detector, a nanopower class-AB current-mode analog multiplier is designed to handle input current amplitudes of more than 10 times the bias current of the multiplier circuit. The invented filter circuits have been fabricated in a standard 0.18 μ CMOS process in order to verify our circuit concepts and design procedures. Their experimental results are reported.","","9788793379282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227856.pdf&bkn=9218905&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"10 Concluding Remarks","A. Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","177","178","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228005.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Sensor networks are also suitable candidates for UWB since the low radiated power of the UWB transmitter enables low DC power consumption, yielding long battery life and the possibility to use energy scavenging. Size and cost constraints require a low-complexity approach that allows multiple users to share the same RF bandwidth, and offers robustness to interference, frequency-selective multipath and antenna mismatch. Wideband FM Techniques for Low-Power Wireless Communications presents research and applications that have taken place in UWB Communications over the past years. This book is being published posthumously in agreement with the authors’ former colleagues from both the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) and Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands.","","9788793379619","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228651.pdf&bkn=9218789&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"8 Integrating CSR in Different Industries","A. Aagaard",NA,"Sustainable Business: Integrating CSR in Business and Functions","","2016","","","133","162","The developments in our environment and society have made it clear that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though the state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations’ different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: • Sustainable business and CSR • CSR strategy integration • Stakeholder management • Sustainable production • Responsible HRM and administration • Cradle-to-cradle • Green procurement • Sustainable supply chain management • Corporate social innovation • Sustainable innovation • Sustainable Communication and – Sales • Business-NGO partnership","","9788793379800","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227979.pdf&bkn=9218795&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"6 Sustainable Performance in Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs): A Critical Review","",,"Management for Sustainable Development","","2016","","","149","160","Today, increasingly more, the word sustainability is present in all kinds of discussions: at home, at work, at school, in all society. Conscious of the environment where we live everybody looks to find the best solutions to solve problems that result from Human Being evolution. Management for a sustainable development appears as a process from which organizations try to use all its resources, as well as improve its organizational and technological development, in order to answer not only to the present but also to future human and social needs. Only in this way is it possible to improve the quality of life. Seen in this way, sustainable development is understood to be people centred. We have a special concern with cultural, social and economic dimensions, where individuals can develop, together as a society, whilst at the same time individual and organizational activities can be implemented without destroying the present diversity and complexity of the ecological system where we live. Taking into account these concerns, this book looks to cover issues related to the management for sustainable development in a context where organizations are continually facing high challenges for what concerns the items related to, amongst others, the re-use, recycling, waste reduction, add value, low costs and time of production, sustainable behaviour, not only in an environmental perspective but also in an organizational perspective. Today’s organizations can no longer develop their practices based in the existent paradigms. On the contrary, it is necessary to completely break from these paradigms, creating a total change of mentality in the way we manage the organizational activities. Taking into account this reality, managing for a sustainable development appears as a management philosophy focused in productivity improvement considering different kinds of goals, such as biological, economic and social systems goals. Conscious of this reality, this book contributes to the exchange of experiences and perspectives about the state of research related to the management for a sustainable development, as well as the future direction of this research field. It looks to provide a support to academics and researchers, as well as those operating in the management field and who need to deal with policies and strategies related to sustainable development issues.","","9788793379091","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227700.pdf&bkn=9218816&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"8 Calendar of Events WREN: 2016 and 2017","",,"Renewable Energy; a Status Quo","","2016","","","167","168","It is evident to all that climate change is happening – the results can be seen in many countries. Floods, freaks storms, wind speeds of more than 80 mph, heat waves, droughts, rising sea levels and disappearing glaciers, largely due to excessive use of fossil fuels. Climate change acceleration began slowly in the 1970s but has now increased beyond our ability to stop it or reduce its impact. Using renewable energy effectively on a large scale will put an end or considerably slow down this process in many parts of the world. This book shows that some countries are making greater efforts than others. Installations of the 70s and 80s were limited to kilowatts while in the 2010s we speak in terms of megawatts. The cost of most renewable energy systems have been reduced by so much that they have reached parity with fossil fuels, or are even cheaper. The most effective progress has been made in photovoltaic systems, whilst concentrated solar power, biomass, wind energy and hydro-power have greatly improved payback periods too. While much is hoped from the outcome of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, realistically in the past very few nations honoured their pledges. A great deal of aid has been given to poor countries which are suffering from climate change, however the donor nations have failed to restrict their own carbon emissions. Many poor countries feel they are being expected to forgo the industrial benefits which came from the industrial revolution powered by fossil fuels.

"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","i","xviii","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally. It also showcases the strategies, tools, and tactical execution on how create cultural change in all parts of the world.","","9788793379671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228674.pdf&bkn=9218770&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Toncich",NA,"Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision A Guide for Supervisors","","2016","","","55","78","Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision - A Guide for Supervisors is designed to inform and support university academics and researchers who are taking on the responsibilities of postgraduate research student supervision. It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation. Additionally, important peripheral issues, such as preparing graduates for various future roles; managing collaborative research programs; managing cases of misfeasance, and developing long-term relationships with students are also covered.","","9788793379435","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227933.pdf&bkn=9218889&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"9 Conflict Resolution in Postgraduate Research","D. Toncich",NA,"Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision A Guide for Supervisors","","2016","","","155","176","Key Factors in Postgraduate Research Supervision - A Guide for Supervisors is designed to inform and support university academics and researchers who are taking on the responsibilities of postgraduate research student supervision. It is aimed at early career professionals, who may be undertaking supervision for the first time, and also experienced supervisors seeking to develop a more formal framework for their supervision, in an increasingly complex academic environment. The objective of the book is to help supervisors create the ""complete postgraduate student"". That is, an individual who can develop the rigors and disciplines of research conduct and research writing, as well as a broader understanding of the environment in which many postgraduate qualified professionals will work. The majority of postgraduate research students in the modern world ultimately use their acquired skills to work outside the university research environment, so emphasis is given to preparing research students for these varied roles, which can include management; commercial research or start-up company pathways. Any competent academic can be a good research supervisor when things are going well. Real supervisory skills only come into play when things have gone awry. That is when a professional and structured approach to problem solving and conflict resolution is required. This book seeks to provide the framework in which supervisors can develop such an approach. The topics covered in this text cover the spectrum of the supervisory process, from understanding the university research environment, through to recruiting students; induction; planning of the research program; peer review and thesis/dissertation preparation.

"2 Behind Every GreatWoman, There May Be a Man","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","54","83","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally. It also showcases the strategies, tools, and tactical execution on how create cultural change in all parts of the world.","","9788793379671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228619.pdf&bkn=9218770&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"4 System-Level Co-Specification","L. Pomante",NA,"Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Embedded Systems","","2016","","","47","62","Modern electronic systems consist of a fairly heterogeneous set of components. Today, a single system can be constituted by a hardware platform, frequently composed of a mix of analog and digital components, and by several software application layers. The hardware can include several heterogeneous microprocessors (e.g. GPP, DSP, GPU, etc.), dedicated ICs (ASICs and/or FPGAs), memories, a set of local connections between the system components, and some interfaces between the system and the environment (sensors, actuators, etc.). Therefore, on the one hand, multi-processor embedded systems are capable of meeting the demand of processing power and flexibility of complex applications. On the other hand, such systems are very complex to design and optimize, so that the design methodology plays a major role in determining the success of the products. For these reasons, to cope with the increasing system complexity, the approaches typically used today are oriented towards co-design methodologies working at the higher levels of abstraction. Unfortunately, such methodologies are typically customized for the specific application, suffer of a lack of generality and still need a considerable effort when real-size project are envisioned. Therefore, there is still the need for a general methodology able to support the designer during the high-level steps of a co-design flow, enabling an effective design space exploration before tackling the low-level steps and thus committing to the final technology. This should prevent costly redesign loops.In such a context, the work described in this book, composed of two parts, aims at providing models, methodologies and tools to support each step of the co-design flow of embedded systems implemented by exploiting heterogeneous multi-processor architectures mapped on distributed systems, as well as fully integrated onto a single chip. The first part focuses on issues like the analysis of system specification languages, and the analysis of existing system-level HW/SW co-simulation methodologies to support heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. The second part focuses mainly on Design Space Exploration, and it presents both some theoretical advancements with respect to the first part, and the development of a prototypal framework that provides practical exploitation of the proposed concepts.","","9788793379374","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227944.pdf&bkn=9218776&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"2 Future Concepts in Solar Thermal Electricity Generation","",,"Renewable Energy; a Status Quo","","2016","","","39","54","It is evident to all that climate change is happening – the results can be seen in many countries. Floods, freaks storms, wind speeds of more than 80 mph, heat waves, droughts, rising sea levels and disappearing glaciers, largely due to excessive use of fossil fuels. Climate change acceleration began slowly in the 1970s but has now increased beyond our ability to stop it or reduce its impact. Using renewable energy effectively on a large scale will put an end or considerably slow down this process in many parts of the world. This book shows that some countries are making greater efforts than others. Installations of the 70s and 80s were limited to kilowatts while in the 2010s we speak in terms of megawatts. The cost of most renewable energy systems have been reduced by so much that they have reached parity with fossil fuels, or are even cheaper. The most effective progress has been made in photovoltaic systems, whilst concentrated solar power, biomass, wind energy and hydro-power have greatly improved payback periods too. While much is hoped from the outcome of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, realistically in the past very few nations honoured their pledges. A great deal of aid has been given to poor countries which are suffering from climate change, however the donor nations have failed to restrict their own carbon emissions. Many poor countries feel they are being expected to forgo the industrial benefits which came from the industrial revolution powered by fossil fuels. The book will outline the achievements of renewable energy by the end of 2015 / beginning of 2016.","","9788793379497","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227954.pdf&bkn=9218906&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"10 Defining the Cutting Edge","",,"The Internet of Women sm Accelerating Culture Change","","2016","","","259","302","Female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide are making historic contributions to their fields. The modern workforce is closer to gender-equal than it has ever been, and many efforts are in place to support further progress. The Internet of Women provides an exciting look at personal narratives and case studies of female leaders and cultural shifts around the globe that illustrate this promising trend. From the United Nations' emphasis on girls and technology education in the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to the increased female labor force in Zambia, a policy change that was inspired by the MDGs (UN Millennial Development Goals), The Internet of Women captures stunning examples of progress from around the world and men working hand in hand with women advocating for cultural change. Scholars and practitioners lament the lack of women leading and working in leading organizations in the technology industry. Gender equality and female participation in the tech field is critical to both developing and developed economies; nevertheless, this gap remains a global phenomenon. The lack of female leadership is particularly extreme at the highest echelons of leading technology organizations. Few publicly traded tech companies have female CEOs - in fact, most nations have zero female leadership in the tech industry. This gap does indicate a slow pace of progress for gender equality in tech employment. Women's pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that women's on average pay today is the equivalent to that of similarly qualified and similarly employed men in 2006. Without significant progress, the current rate of change will not lead to parity for 118 years, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). However there's significant work being done to shift this tide. Take for instance Michelle Lee, the first female Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), reflects on her childhood Girl Scout badge in sewing and cooking and how that memory inspired to create an IP badge that exposes young women to the process of invention. Social entrepreneur, investor, and Malala Fund co-founder Shiza Shahid shares her efforts beginning from mentoring young women in Pakistan to her current work directing more investment to women innovators around the globe. And Elizabeth Isele, a senior fellow in Social Innovation at Babson College, shares her research on women and ageism saying we need to retire the word retirement. The book is divided into six parts, each with unique areas of focus: • Millennials Leading: Exploring Challenges and Opportunities Facing the Next Generation of Women in Technology • Men and Women Empowering One Another• Bold Leadership: Women Changing the Culture of Investment and Entrepreneurship • Educating for the 21st Century • Breaking the Glass Ceiling: A Generation of Women Forging into Technology Leadership • Emerging Fields of TechnologyThe Internet of Women gathers examples about the increasingly inclusive and progressive gender culture in technology from over 30 countries. Stories range from an entrepreneur in Dubai partnering with private and public sector entities to accelerate blockchain technology to a young British woman moving to Silicon Valley to launch an artificial intelligence platform and incubator. The book is intended for corporations, academic institutions, the private sector, government agencies, gender experts, and the general public, and its key benefit is to let the reader understand a path towards implementing diversity overall globally.

Logistics processes are found on the road, rail, water and in the air - logistics is omnipresent. The traditional logistics processes found in a seaport are subject for change. On the one hand the handling of standardized units such as containers is becoming increasingly important, on the other hand the harbors - especially on the North and Baltic sea - play a strategic role in fulfilling the national and European goals in offshore wind energy. A decisive factor for the competitiveness of the offshore wind industry is the increased industrialization in production and logistics. This paper discusses how such logistics processes can benefit from introducing digital services.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9026105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026105","future of ports;digitization;digital services;offshore wind farm components handling;container handling","Containers;Planning;Logistics;Wind farms","globalisation;innovation management;logistics;naval engineering computing;offshore installations;process design;sea ports","globalization;production industrialization;offshore wind industry;offshore wind energy;process innovation;digital services;international logistics process design;seaport","","2","","13","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, from the perspective of patentometrics, this study adopts two analyses, namely the number of patents and patent citations, to discuss the technical capability of R&D portfolios and the technological knowledge flow. R&D portfolios integrate the three patent indices of technology attractiveness, relative patent position (RPP) and revealed patent advantage (RPA), and these can be used to analyze the strength and weakness of the R&D portfolio of a company in the industry. In addition, technological knowledge flow helps to construct a patent citation network through the backward citation of patents. Sources and movement directions of the technological knowledge can be measured by calculating the relative citation propensity. R&D portfolios and knowledge flow are complementary perspectives of each other and a combination of the two can effectively help identify the portfolios and monitor of the technical capabilities between solar photovoltaic companies.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9026018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026018","solar photovoltaic;R&D portfolio;knowledge flows;patentometrics;patent backward citation","Patents;Companies;Portfolios;Silicon;Photovoltaic systems;Mathematical model","investment;patents;research and development;solar cells","R&D portfolio;solar photovoltaic companies;patentometrics perspective;solar photovoltaic technologies;operational performance;technological advantages;cooperating companies;portfolios;technical capability;patent citations;technological knowledge flow;patent indices;technology attractiveness;relative patent position;patent citation network;relative citation propensity;complementary perspectives","","","","13","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A previous study has unveiled the great potential of close-to-real-life immersion perceived by users/citizens in realistic environments that not only fulfil the “realism” principle of a Living Lab but also greatly contribute to both phenomena of technology acceptance and adoption of the proposed solution. Scholars have previously identified three main factors characterizing an immersive environment: the degree of immersiveness, presence and engagement perceived by users. However, creating close to real-life simulated city environments that provide an appropriate degree of immersiveness, presence and engagement for potential users in the context of urban projects remains a challenge. The traditional working habits of smart cities stakeholders, such as: territorial engineers, town-planners and policy makers, are not prepared for behaving properly in immersive environments. Several experiments were carried out during different events that provided both quantitative and qualitative data through the use of surveys, interviews and observations. For each experiment several VR/AR equipment were used. The findings highlight the complementarity between physical and digital technologies supporting co-creation for smart city projects, and the advantage of enabling experts in a field to discover new technologies. Finally, this study provides valuable elements on how to better support close to real-life simulated city environments while providing a higher level of stakeholders' engagement during the ideation of the co-creation stage of the innovation process towards the realization of smart-cities.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9025965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025965","augmented-reality;virtual-reality;immersive-environment;open-innovation;living-lab;user-centered design;co-creation;design;user experience","Technological innovation;Smart cities;Software;Stakeholders;Solid modeling;Two dimensional displays","augmented reality;decision making;innovation management;Internet;smart cities;town and country planning","innovation process;explorative study;augmented reality;close-to-real-life immersion;realistic environments;technology acceptance;immersive environment;real-life simulated city environments;smart city projects","","12","","31","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, there comes a sudden need to create new products more quickly than previously defined processes are designed for. Companies often seek to find different processes for projects of differing scope and complexity. There are many approaches to accelerating product development and reducing lead-time, but there is very little empirical research on how companies actually organize these faster development projects. A case study of eight companies was conducted with semi-structured interviews and focus groups to find out how they approach product development when they need to create product faster than what their new product development processes would allow. Results show that companies with a product-based offering have identified projects with different scope and complexity, but have not always defined how to approach them successfully. Companies with a project-based offering tend to approach all projects in a similar manner and do not make large changes to their processes based on project scope. The most used literature-based approaches that the case companies followed were: overlapping development stages, lead user involvement and emphasizing the customer.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9026104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026104","new product development;NPD;business-to-business;B2B;rapid development","Companies;Product development;Interviews;Lead;Acceleration;Decision making","organisational aspects;product development","customer requests;development projects;product development processes;product-based offering;product development needs","","","","20","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Managing requirements interdependencies in Agile software development is a relatively unexplored topic. If requirements interdependencies are neglected, it can cause unexpected cost increase and this can be detrimental to startups given the limited resources that they have. Objective: The objectives of the study is to explore and identify practices and challenges associated with managing requirements interdependencies in Agile software development. Method: We employed a web-based survey as a data collection approach. To analyse the data we used open coding as the data collected was primarily qualitative. Results: The results shows that 50% of respondents consider requirements interdependencies. Agile practices such as Kan-ban/Scrum board, retrospectives, and iteration planning, were used by the respondents in the context of managing requirements interdependencies. A number of tools like Jira and Git were also identified in the survey. Challenges identified were inefficient processes, incremental modification rate, and dependencies to other services. Conclusions: Requirements interdependencies should be managed early in the startup lifecycle because it can be expensive and complex as the software evolves and grows. Agile software development still lacks support and guidelines for practitioners to manage requirements interdependencies as part of agile methodologies. The findings in this study can help startups with, for example, identifying useful practices and understanding the challenges they will face. However, more research needs to be done to support software startups to maintain an efficient process in managing requirements interdependencies despite their growth.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9025919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025919","Agile software development;requirements interdependencies;software startup;survey","Agile software development;Software;Encoding;Tools;Companies;Software engineering;Data analysis","formal specification;Internet;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping","agile software development;requirements interdependencies;software startups;Web-based survey","","1","","16","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a first step the systems architecture is developed by applying content analysis as a synthesis of a literature review from the fields of performance measurement, NPD success factors and project management. As a result, critical success factors from 20 publications could be clustered to 9 performance dimensions and 20 performance categories. All identified performance categories could be mapped within the developed systems model.

As such, practitioners' core mission to effectively identify and communicate the needs of communities among stakeholders and throughout different organizational levels drives innovation. The environment demands innovations by practitioners to ensure the transfer of information, and it's embedded meaning, is bridged across disparate technological modes and information systems. We found a common problem-solving perspective toward work, awareness of gaps in the flow of meaning and information across stakeholders, along with multi-modal, multi-cultural and interpersonal fluencies active where innovations occur. When empowered with the autonomy to adapt tools, successful practitioners are able to support the effective transfer of meaning across cultures, organizational perspective and technological environments. Ultimately, these findings enhance our understanding of the use of technology in humanitarian work.

Business plans of NTBFs represent the artifact that contains this data in the form of transaction relation descriptions. Using content analysis, a multi-step combined human and computer coding process has been developed to empirically determine NTBFs' status of VE.Results of the business plan analysis suggests that the level of transaction relations allows to draw conclusions on the status of VE.

Agreement on the evaluations of venturing projects based on the business plans highly depends on the individual perspective of the readers [5], [6]. One reason is that little empirical proof exists for descriptions in business plans that suggest survival of early-stage technology ventures [7] [9]. We identified descriptions of transaction relations [10] [13] as an anchor of the snapshot model business plan to business reality [13]. In the early-stage, surviving ventures are building transaction relations to human resources, financial resources, and suppliers on the input side, and customers on the output side of the business towards a stronger ego-centric value network [10] [13]. We conceptualized a multidimensional measurement instrument that evaluates the maturity of egocentric value networks based on the transaction relations of different strength categories that are described in business plans of early-stage technology ventures [13]. In this paper, the research design and the instrument are purified to achieve high agreement in the evaluation of a business plan [14] [16].

Despite the large and fast growing body of research demonstrating the potential benefits of improved collaboration, ineffective and inefficient collaboration patterns are still undermining the competitiveness of many businesses. To address this, several frameworks have been developed to assess compliance with known collaboration success factors, and analyze collaboration barriers and associated solutions. However, despite promising results, these frameworks are still mostly used by external consultants or researchers with prior experience from collaborative performance improvement projects or initiatives, while their use (without external involvement) is still limited in most industrial companies. Consequently, there is a lack of a simple and effective methodological framework that can be applied without external assistance, based on existing research and supported by empirical evidence. This paper presents a DIY (Do It Yourself) modeling framework based on the Business Model Canvas - the Collaboration Model Canvas (CMC). The CMC is suitable for both ad hoc and established collaborations across companies, co-working spaces, incubators, science/business parks and business networks - in particular for those that are already familiar with business modeling and the Business Model Canvas. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the framework has been successfully validated in a simple case study in a master level class. The paper describes the framework, presents and discusses the results and presents some initial conclusions before outlining some directions for future research.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9026160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026160","collaboration;collaboration model canvas;business modeling;fourth industrial revolution;exponential technology trends","Collaboration;Companies;Technological innovation;Tools;Knowledge engineering","groupware;knowledge management;organisational aspects;project management","business model canvas;business networks;productive collaborative behavior;collaboration patterns;collaboration barriers;collaborative performance improvement projects;collaboration model canvas;DIY modeling framework;Do It Yourself modeling framework","","2","","25","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are an important driving force of innovation. Although, a significant amount of research efforts has been paid on the outcome and benefits of business incubators, there is still a scarcity of studies on the role of business incubators in empowering technology-based startups and making them a success. The current paper aims to address this inconclusiveness. As a first step, it explores the supportive activities offered by business incubators. For our research, we use data from eleven interviews with founders of high-tech startups, who received the support of public incubators. Our research methodology follows grounded theory to code and categorize the data. The first result shows the classification of supportive activities of BIs into five categories: (1) networking, (2) monitoring, (3) knowledge development, (4), resource mobilization, and (5) creation of exposure. As a second result, we map the interrelations between the identified activities, and present our conceptual framework. The framework can be considered as a tool to measure the effectiveness of BIs' activities on New Technology-Based Firms (NTBFs). It is illustrated by exploring five propositions. The paper contributes to the development of incubators, and incubator-incubatee impact studies through the lens of resource-based theory. It concludes with recommendations for researchers and practitioners.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9026138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026138","Business Incubators;actual supportive activities;New Technology-Based Firms","Business;Mentoring;Interviews;Biological system modeling;Mediation;Technological innovation;Economics","innovation management;knowledge management;organisational aspects;resource allocation;technology management","business incubators;public incubators;supportive activities;technology-based startups;new technology-based firms;NTBFs;resource-based theory","","1","","39","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our work is motivated by the fact that if Innovation capability cannot be measured, then it is inherently difficult for any person or organization to improve their ability to be innovative. The approach is also intended to cover various facets of innovation: 1) Strategy and Leadership, 2) Innovation Culture from an Organization's Viewpoint, 3) Organizational Operations and Measures across functions, 4) Mindset: The Innovation DNA of the People, and 5) Tactical measures. In this paper, we focus on one particular facet, which is a person's mindset towards innovation (number 4 above). The work on this facet can be divided in four steps. In this paper we describe BII, the four steps of work, the algorithm, the learning model, and the initial results of the Innovation Mindset Instrument. The tool has been used to conduct a survey on the students attending the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, a 4-day intensive class experience on innovation and entrepreneurship. It can be concluded that by the third day of the class, the innovation mindset levels have increased by half of a standard deviation, and by the final day, the class has increased its Innovation Mindset score by a full standard deviation. The Innovation Mindset score is not a test of knowledge, but instead a test of beliefs about oneself.

However, despite the notable advantages of using mobile phone technology in SMEs, their values have been explained in generic way. Specifics on direct and indirect benefits on particular aspect and circumstances have not been explored. The main challenge is that, it is difficult to single out the values of a technology in organisations because there are other separate factors which also contribute to the overall performance.Identifying specific values of mobile technology on the performance of SMEs is vital for improving utility of such performance in accomplishing the strategic objectives.

Conventionally, information about how a product is used is gathered in customer relations and MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) processes via channels such as repair logs, call centres or helpdesks. Today, new channels of PUI are emerging from the digitalization of products, the Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet PUI sources and social media. However, there is a lack of a methodological approach which companies use to select the right PUI source for the design of services, and vice-versa, to understand which valueadded services can be offered using information already generated by sensors embedded into their products or available on the Internet or in social media.

From this material, we identified four elements contributing to the value of IBI and constructed a framework for managing this value. Furthermore, we identified the sources of the difference between the potential value and the realized value of IBI. The elements contributing to the value of IBI are its management, scope, utilization and quality. These elements form interconnected leaves in the proposed value clover framework. Each element potentially contributes to the difference between the theoretical maximum value and the realized value of IBI. Future research should look into the different elements and their relationships in more detail. Our framework helps managers in identifying and balancing the different elements of IBI value and in deciding on investments in this area.

Chuma [1] demonstrated that one of the biggest reasons for ASML's remarkable success can be attributed to their adoption of the modular architecture in contrast to Nikon's integral architecture. This paper will describe how Nikon fell into the integrity trap because they embraced the integral architecture so profoundly that Engineers with strong attachments to their traditional architectural knowledge created an information filter. Furthermore, it will also show how ASML who adopted the modular architecture did not fall into the modularity trap but rather established a new modular architecture by developing strong relationships with established customers, suppliers, and industry consortia and implementing an organizational policy where no one person is responsible for multiple generations of architectures.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9026088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026088","product architecture;integrality trap;modularity trap;semiconductor exposure component","Industries;Companies;Tools;Technological innovation;Information filters","automobile industry;electronic products;innovation management;knowledge management;organisational aspects;product development","automotive industry;technology innovation;modular architecture;integrity trap;modularity trap;product development;semiconductor exposure tool industry;semiconductor chips;large-scale industry equipment;Nikon integral architecture","","","","8","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technological variety and heterogeneity along with selection mechanism are the essential parts of technology evolution process. In this article we propose the method for the estimation of new technology emergence and the evaluation of the mechanisms of technology transitions. The method is based on the analysis of variance between leading and lagging technology frontiers and on the analysis of variance dynamics between product segments.

Pursuing this effort, a new program and project management (PPM) approach specifically devoted to support collaborative university-industry R&D funded contracts is incrementally being developed. The management of a program of projects requires also the management of all the constituent projects. Therefore, the PPM approach introduces two layers: one layer for supporting the management of the program at the strategic level and another layer for manageming the constituent projects in strait alignment with the program strategy. A common and consistent set of management phases is being established for both layers with several key program and project management activities/practices identified. This paper aims to present and discuss the results of a quantitative study of the implementation of the first version of the PPM approach in a real case, which embraced an investment of 19.2 M€ and involved around 300 people during two years (2013-2015). The questionnaire has elicited 170 responses.

A metal strip grating on a grounded dielectric slab is used to illustrate the use of the slab Green's function, to demonstrate the application of Floquet's theorem and to obtain the complex propagation constant for this structure. The Green's function for any open boundary problem is in terms of a complex plane line integral having its endpoints at infinity and branch points in the integrand.

The signals of interest are often generated while testing functioning hardware. Tests can take place over time, in a harsh environment, during an explosion, during a flight, or in a collision. The chapter also focuses on analog circuits that operate below 100 kHz. The availability of integrated circuits has simplified many aspects of analog circuit design. Instrumentation must often handle long signal lines, reject ground potential differences, and maintain circuit stability. The general problem of analog design is called signal conditioning, which includes gain, filtering, offsets, bridge balancing, common‐mode rejection, transducer excitation, and calibration. Measurements of temperature, strain, stress, position, and vibration are an important part of many development efforts. In vibration analysis, the sensing transducer is often a quartz crystal. This crystal is electrically equivalent to a capacitor.","","9781119183730","10.1002/9781119183723.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9004589.pdf&bkn=8371438&pdfType=chapter","","Conductors;Instruments;Analog circuits;Transducers;Bandwidth;Grounding;Interference","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

This chapter presents in detail, in particular: image theory, uniqueness, surface, volume and induction equivalents and the physical optics approximation. Potentials are also used for constructing field solutions in source‐free regions, in particular, waveguides. Several cases are presented to demonstrate these techniques. To solve a boundary value problem, there are many ways to choose the vector potentials. The choice is not unique, and it is also problem dependent. The potentials should be chosen in such a way that the resulting fields have enough degrees of freedom to allow that the boundary conditions be met. Radiation integrals are often needed for sources that are in the x ‐ y plane. These are useful for aperture antennas such as the horn, reflector and open‐ended waveguide.","","9781118940556","10.1002/9781119127444.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9005031.pdf&bkn=8371483&pdfType=chapter","","Electric potential;Propagation;Electric fields;Differential equations;Frequency-domain analysis;Electrostatics","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

"Physical Theory of Diffraction","R. Paknys",NA,"Applied Frequency-Domain Electromagnetics","","2016","","","317","334","Physical optics uses geometrical optics to estimate the surface current. This current is then used in a radiation integral to find the scattered field. PO often works very well for electrically large and smooth bodies. However, in spite of its great success in many applications, the use of an approximate current can lead to inherent limitations of its accuracy. The physical theory of diffraction (PTD) is an important high‐frequency technique that addresses this problem. The PTD became a widely used technique for the analysis and design of antennas, radar cross‐section analysis, and stealth design. The PTD theory is first developed in 2D. Its use is demonstrated by calculating the radiation pattern of a reflector antenna. It is then be generalized to 3D and applied to the scattering by a circular disc. The PTD formulation is closely related to both geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) and uniform theory of diffraction (UTD).","","9781118940556","10.1002/9781119127444.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9005083.pdf&bkn=8371483&pdfType=chapter","","Geometrical optics;Surface waves;Physical theory of diffraction;Diffraction;Optical surface waves;Frequency-domain analysis;Electromagnetics","","","","1","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

An induced current comes from the interaction of a field with any surrounding media and/or boundaries. The Lorentz reciprocity theorem gives a useful relation between two sets of independent sources and their fields. Communication and radar systems involve antennas at large distances that, for all practical purposes, transmit and receive plane waves.

It also motivates the philosophy of Bayesian processing from a probabilistic perspective. The development of Bayesian signal processing has led from theoretically appealing methods to pragmatic implementations capable of providing reasonable solutions for nonlinear and highly multi‐modal problems. The chapter presents the Bayesian approach from a statistical viewpoint and then couple it to useful signal processing implementations following the well‐known model‐based approach. The simulation‐based approach to Bayesian processing is founded on Monte Carlo (MC) methods that are stochastic computational techniques capable of efficiently simulating highly complex systems. Perhaps the best way to visualize the MC methods follows directly from the example of Frenkel. Since the book primarily concerned with pseudo real‐time techniques, it introduces the notion of a recursive form leading to the idea of sequential processing techniques.","","9781119125471","10.1002/9781119125495.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9004497.pdf&bkn=8371510&pdfType=chapter","","Bayes methods;Signal processing;Monte Carlo methods;Estimation;Data mining;Probability distribution;Program processors","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

The B field is the force or induction field that operates motors and transformers. The chapter discusses the movement of electrical energy into inductors or across transformers. It shows that iron cores in transformers reduce the magnetizing current so that transformer action is practical at power frequencies. The chapter also shows that a changing magnetic field produces both an electric field and voltages. Both fields must be in transition before electrical energy can be moved. Inductors in the microhenry range are often wound on a small cylindrical core. The magnetizing inductance of a transformer can be measured at the primary connections if the secondary coils are open circuited. A practical way to measure inductance is to use Faraday's law.","","9781119183730","10.1002/9781119183723.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9004616.pdf&bkn=8371438&pdfType=chapter","","Magnetic fields;Conductors;Solenoids;Force;Electric fields;Permeability","","","","2","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

This chapter applies the method to some differential equations, in particular the Laplace, Poisson and Helmholtz wave equations. The general idea behind the FEM is that it solves for a potential function or a field, which is discretized into N sample values. Energy minimization can be used to solve all sorts of physical problems, both electrical and mechanical. In mathematics, the minimization procedure is called a variational method. For an open structure such as an antenna, the air region surrounding the antenna must be discretized as well. This can lead to a matrix equation with a large number of unknowns. This issue is handled by surrounding the antenna and some of the air region with an absorbing boundary, thus making the computational domain finite in size.","","9781118940556","10.1002/9781119127444.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9005071.pdf&bkn=8371483&pdfType=chapter","","Finite element analysis;Energy storage;Conductors;Differential equations;Boundary conditions;Antennas;Transmission line matrix methods","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Plane waves are used to obtain the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients for an air‐material interface. The chapter discusses the phenomenon of total internal reflection and non‐uniform plane waves. It explains approximate impedance boundary conditions (IBCs) and describes a recursive method for calculating the reflection by multi‐layer materials. Transmission lines support TEM waves of finite transverse extent. The chapter discusses their characteristics in terms of fields and also in terms of an equivalent LC‐ladder circuit. It considers reflection and transmission of waves on transmission lines and explains the concepts of phase velocity, group velocity and dispersion.","","9781118940556","10.1002/9781119127444.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9004650.pdf&bkn=8371483&pdfType=chapter","","Electromagnetic scattering;Magnetic fields;Frequency-domain analysis;Time-domain analysis;Dielectrics","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Paknys",NA,"Applied Frequency-Domain Electromagnetics","","2016","","","355","380","When a forcing function or source term is present, the wave equation is inhomogeneous, and the forced response is called the Green's function. This chapter describes a method for finding 1D Green's functions. The 1D solution is used to construct 2D and 3D solutions via a generalized separation of variables (GSV). The resulting 2D and 3D Green's functions are in terms of contour integrals in the complex plane. The contour integrals possess singularities. In any kind of open boundary problem, the integrand contains a complex‐valued square root function, which has a branch cut; with a closed boundary, poles are present. Evaluation of integrals containing these types of singularities is illustrated by finding the Green's functions for a waveguide and for a wedge. Linear differential equations with constant coefficients can be solved with the method of undetermined coefficients.","","9781118940556","10.1002/9781119127444.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9005160.pdf&bkn=8371483&pdfType=chapter","","Green's function methods;Boundary conditions;Impedance;Differential equations;Frequency-domain analysis;Electromagnetics;Propagation","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

It first develops the Bayesian paradigm using the generic state‐space representation of the required conditional distributions and show how they propagate within the Bayesian framework. Next, the chapter starts with the linear (time‐varying) Gauss‐Markov model and develops the required conditional distributions leading to the well‐known Kalman filter processor. It then develops the extended Bayesian processor (XBP), or equivalently the extended Kalman filter (EKF), as a special case of the linearized Bayesian processor (LZ‐BP) linearizing about the most currently available estimate. Next, the chapter investigates a further enhancement of the XBP by introducing a local iteration of the nonlinear measurement system. Here the processor is called the iterated extended Bayesian processor (IX‐BP) and is shown to produce improved estimates at a small computational cost in most cases.

The millimeter-wave band offers large bandwidths to be exploited, which eases the spectrum crunch for bands below 3 GHz. In order to mitigate the path loss from high frequencies, a large antenna array and beamforming technology are adopted to increase the link gain. However, a challenge arises from the new band. Given the order of gigahertz bandwidth and the high sampling rate, the high-resolution ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) used in the large array creates a power consumption bottleneck. One solution is to use a low-resolution ADC to replace the full-precision ADC. In this paper, we propose a mixed LMS (Least Mean Square) receiver beamforming method for a millimeter-wave one-bit antenna array. We first use a grid-based approach to roughly estimate the DOA (Direction of Arrival) of the incoming signal. Then, we use the steering vector for the DOA as an initial value for the LMS method. A simulation shows that our proposed mixed LMS receiver beamforming method for the one-bit antenna array attains a performance level near the optimal one that obtained with an accurate DOA. The radiation pattern of the mixed LMS method almost overlaps the pattern for the accurate DOA, and the spectral effciency of the mixed LMS method reach up with that obtained from accurate DOA. Furthermore, owing to the use of initial values from rough DOA estimation, the mixed LMS method has a fast convergence.","2509-3312","","10.11959/j.issn.2096-1081.2016.027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932260","millimeter wave;one-bit;beamforming;DOA;LMS","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Receiving antennas;Millimeter wave technology;Array signal processing;Linear antenna arrays","","","","","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

However, the wireless channel characteristics and models are important but still unknown, and thus in this study, extensive measurements and modeling have been conducted to study the characteristics of the high-frequency 15-GHz band. Specifically, a PN(Pseudo Noise) sequence based time-domain measurement system was built and applied to measure the propagation characteristics of the LOS (Line-of-Sight) and NLOS (Non-Line-of-Sight ) scenarios in an indoor corridor at 15 GHz. Then, in-depth analysis and modeling on the large-scale characteristics of wireless channels, the relationship between distance and path loss, the path loss exponent, and the shadow fading standard variance are provided.

In a typical CoT infrastructure, the data collected from wireless sensor networks and IoTs is transmitted through a SG (Smart Gateway) to the cloud. The bandwidth between an IoT access point and SG becomes a bottleneck for information transmission between the IoT and the cloud. We propose a novel game theory model to describe the CoT attacker, who expects to use minimum set and energy consumption of IoT attack devices to occupy as many bandwidth resources as possible in a given time period; and the defender, who expects to minimize false alarms. By analyzing this model, we have found that the game theory model is a non-cooperative and repeated incomplete information game, and Nash equilibrium is existent, perfected by the subgame. The best strategy for each stage of the attack is to adjust the attack link number dynamically based on the comparison results of value ε and turning point ε0 for each time period. At the same time, the defender adjusts the threshold value β dynamically, based on the comparison results of the Load value and expected value of α for each time period. The simulation result shows that our strategy can significantly mitigate the harm of a distributed denial of service attack.","2509-3312","","10.11959/j.issn.2096-1081.2016.040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932324","Cloud of Things;network security;DDoS attack;smart gateway;energy consumption","Cloud computing;Botnet;Denial-of-service attack;Games;Computer crime;Internet of Things;Bandwidth","","","","","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

The accurate estimate of file delivery latency (i.e., RTT (Round Trip Time)) is essential for efficient transmission control, reliable delivery, and bandwidth usage optimization of a protocol. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of BP running over UDPCL/UDP over deep-space channels, focusing on the RTT estimate, in the presence of highly asymmetric channel rates. Analytical models are built for the RTT estimate of the BP/UDPCL transmissions considering the effect of delay caused by space channel-rate asymmetry, and, channel impairment. The models are validated by file transfer experiments using a PC-based testbed. It is found that a smaller bundle size (if smaller than a calculated threshold) results in a longer delay in custody acknowledgment transmission, and thus, a longer RTT.","2509-3312","","10.11959/j.issn.2096-1081.2016.018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932207","deep-space communications;delay/disruption-tolerant networking;bundle protocol","Delays;Receivers;Protocols;Deep-space communications;Propagation delay;Mars;Orbits","","","","","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

Finally, the asymptotic expressions of an end-to-end SINR are derived. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that when the number of relay antennas grows very large, the SE (Spectral Efficiency) of an MM-AF relay system is limited by hardware impairments at the users instead of those at the relay, or by other types of interference.

Along with the deployment of low earth orbit satellite constellations (e.g. the OneWeb constellation) for global broadband Internet services, small satellite receivers of the size of a pizza box may be used to achieve 3D rainfall tomography anywhere on the Earth, thereby paving the way for many practical applications and atmospheric research that are associated with rainfall.","2509-3312","","10.11959/j.issn.2096-1081.2016.009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932222","satellite communications;computerized tomography;rain measurement","Satellites;Rain;Three-dimensional displays;Attenuation;Tomography;Extraterrestrial measurements;Microwave communication","","","","","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

However, the OLED remains one of the most power-hungry components in mobile devices. Various optimization schemes have been proposed based on the color-dependent power consumption feature of OLED pixels. These schemes mainly focus on color modification during the playback phase and require significant overhead in terms of frame analysis and real-time modification. While such schemes are effective, the power saving opportunities during the camera recording phase are overlooked. To further enhance the power optimization, the camera parameters during the recording phase could be effectively utilized to reduce or eliminate the optimization overhead. Hence, we proposed MORPh, a cross-layer optimization system for OLED display in the smartphones. We analyze three fundamental parameters of smartphone camera system and their impact on the OLED screen power consumption. We then define corresponding metrics to quantitatively assess each parameter's potential of power saving guidance. Finally, we develop a set of schemes and integrated them into a video recording and playback application on an existing Android smartphone. The experiments results indicate power saving of 7.3% 39.7%, and 20.3% on average while maintaining perceived visual quality.","2150-5519","978-1-4503-4535-4","10.1145/2990299.2990302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909117","","Organic light emitting diodes;Cameras;Power demand;Image color analysis;Optimization;Brightness;Smart phones","LED displays;mobile computing;organic light emitting diodes;power aware computing;power consumption;smart phones","power saving guidance;OLED screen power consumption;smartphone camera system;OLED display;cross-layer optimization system;camera parameters;power optimization;camera recording phase;power saving opportunities;playback phase;color modification;OLED pixels;color-dependent power consumption feature;power-hungry components;display screen market;OLED technology;power efficiency;mobile OLED power friendly camera system","","","","12","","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research nuclear reactor facilities often possess unanticipated sources of noise due to the aging facilities, electronic pump and compressor motors, and electromechanical control systems. A robust method to transmitMPFD pulse signals from the MPFD sensors to the readout electronics is under development. Numerous pre-amplifiers were tested to determine the preferred signal processing method for MPFDs.

The HP definition is a formal, mathematical definition. Although this does add some initial overhead, it has an important advantage: it prevents ambiguity about whether A counts as a cause of B. There is no need, as in many other definitions, to try to understand how to interpret the words. For example, recall the INUS condition from the notes in Chapter 1. For A to be a cause of B under this definition, A has to be a necessary part of a condition that is itself unnecessary but insufficient for B. But what is a ""condition""? The formalization of INUS suggests that it is a formula or set of formulas. Is there any constraint on this set?

We ended up writing a paper on actual causality that forms the basis of this book. I was fortunate to have other coauthors who helped me on my (still ongoing) journey to a deeper understanding of causality and related notions, particularly Hana Chockler, Chris Hitchcock, and Tobi Gerstenberg.

X = x can be the cause of ϕ in one causal model and not in another. Many features of a causal model can impact claims of causality. It is clear that the structural equations can have a major impact on the conclusions we draw about causality. For example, it is the equations that allow us to conclude that lower air pressure is the cause of the lower barometer reading and not the other way around; increasing the barometer reading will not result in higher air pressure.","","9780262336611","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8951220.pdf&bkn=8951009&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","9 Jan 2020","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

Although that position is mitigated somewhat by the notion of graded causality discussed in Chapter 3, and by the probabilistic notion of causality discussed in Section 2.5, it is still the case that either A is a cause of B or it is not (in a causal setting (M, U)). Graded causality does allow us to think of some causes as being better than others; with probability, we can take a better cause to be one that has a higher probability of being the cause.

The size of the solution space would increase exponentially as the scale of the power grid increases. The goal of our controlled islanding strategy is to divide the system into several islands quickly. Mean-while, the generator coherency and the power-flow disruption have to be taken into consideration carefully. This paper proposed a two-stage fast islanding strategy for large power networks, which is on the basis of large power grid graph theories. In the first stage, the Stoer-Wagner algorithm is employed to obtain the grouping cluster of coherent generators in the dynamic undirected liaison graph. In the second stage, the improved Dinic max-flow method is proposed to search the optimal splitting boundary so as to acquire the minimum power flow impact. Our two-stage islanding strategy does not need to reduce the whole power network. Simulations on IEEE 118-bus and 162-bus power systems showed that the proposed strategy can acquire high quality solutions effectively and efficiently.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0206-7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946811","Controlled islanding;Non-deterministic polynomial hard problem;Stoer-Wagner;Max-flow;Partition boundary","Generators;Power system stability;Islanding;Power grids;Linear programming;Rotors","","","","","","37","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Such misoperations have been a main culprit of cascading failures in modern power systems. The likelihood of recovery from protection misoperations is quantified by a set of security indices that formally incorporate the uncertain knowledge of the continuous-state of rotor angles/speed deviations of synchronous generators and that of the discrete-state of equipment faults and primary protection misoperations. The proposed secondary protection leverages on the ever more available time-synchronized samples of networked sensors for diagnosis and fault-tolerant control to cost effectively improving power system reliability without altering the existing protection system.

Some new fault characteristics including voltage phase angle jump will emerge, which will influence the power quality of power system. However, there are very few studies focusing on the mechanism of voltage phase angle jump under grid fault in a weak grid with wind turbine integration. This paper focuses on the scientific issues and carries out mechanism studies from different aspects, including mathematical deduction, field data analysis and time domain simulation. Based on the analysis of transient characteristics of DFIGs during the grid fault, this paper points out that the change of terminal voltage phase angle in DFIGs is an electromagnetism transition process, which is different from conventional synchronous generator.

In this case, two indices that measure the customer satisfaction are then introduced as constraints to reduce the impact to end-users and avoid extreme demand adjustment. To make the model solvable, a proximate decoupling technique is used to dispose the concave constraint introduced by the customer satisfaction constraints. Results from the case studies show that the proposed model can significantly reduce the operation cost of power system while the demand response meets customer satisfaction. Especially, the total start-up costs of conventional thermal units decreases dramatically due to less startup times. Moreover, compared to the consumption way satisfaction constraint, the payment satisfaction constraint has a heavier influence on the cost.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0136-9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946806","Optimal scheduling;Wind power;Real-time pricing;Customer satisfaction","Load management;Wind power generation;Optimal scheduling;Customer satisfaction;Elasticity;Power systems","","","","7","","22","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Wind power from big wind farms, with randomness, volatility and intermittent, will bring adverse impacts on the connected power system. High precision wind power forecasting is helpful to reduce above adverse impacts. There are two kinds of wind power forecasting. One is to forecast wind power only based on its time series data. The other is to forecast wind power based on wind speeds from weather forecast. For a big wind farm, due to its spatial scale and dynamics of wind, wind speeds at different wind turbines are obviously different, that is called wind speed spatial dispersion. Spatial dispersion of wind speeds and its influence on the wind power forecasting errors have been studied in this paper. An error evaluation framework has been established to account for the errors caused by wind speed spatial dispersion. A case study of several wind farms has demonstrated that even if the forecasting average wind speed is accurate, the error caused by wind speed spatial dispersion cannot be ignored for the wind power forecasting of a wind farm.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0151-x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946797","Wind farm;Wind speed;Spatial dispersion;Wind power;Forecasting error","Wind speed;Wind power generation;Wind turbines;Forecasting;Wind farms;Dispersion;Wind forecasting","","","","1","","13","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Thus, effective scheduling of both resources holds the key to sustainable practice. This paper presents a scheduling scenario-based approach in the smart grid. Problem formulation with dual objective function including both emissions and cost is developed for conventional unit commitment with EV and RET deployment. In this work, the scheduling and commitment problem is solved using the fireworks algorithm which mimics explosion of fireworks in the sky to define search space and the distance between associated sparks to evaluate global minimum.

This paper deals with the issues related to the emulated inertia of wind turbines based on full-converters and their effect on the under-frequency protection schemes during the recovery period after system frequency disturbances happen. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the recovery period of under-frequency transients in future power systems which integrate wind turbines with emulated inertia capability does not completely avoid the worse scenarios in terms of under-frequency load shedding. The extra power delivered from a wind turbine during frequency disturbances can substantially reduce the rate of frequency change.

The interaction between MG and the unbalance loads or DGs will degrades the control performance of interfaced inverter in MG and dramatically leads to MG voltage unbalance. In this paper, a negative-sequence compensation based three-phase voltage unified correction strategy is proposed. While MG operates in islanded mode, a positive virtual impedance control is used to eliminate the negative voltage resulted from the negative-sequence current, and then a positive-sequence voltage control loop and negative-sequence control loop are used to improve the inverter control performance. While MG operates in grid-tied mode, the inverter operates as a negative-sequence current source to compensate the negative-sequence currents of loads to guarantee the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage balance. By using the proposed strategy, the voltage control performance of inverter can be improved; the MG power quality can be enhanced significantly. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0182-3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946686","Microgrid;Inverter;Three-phase unbalance;Negative compensation","Voltage control;Inverters;Impedance;Microgrids;Switches;Power quality;Standards","","","","13","","18","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

However, this model may be inaccurate in the short term analysis, where the transient process of availability has not ended yet. Furthermore, the power equipment in the short term analysis might be influenced by both random factors and deterministic factors, yet the impact of deterministic factors cannot be completely reflected in the traditional outage model. Based on the above issues, a Markov-based transient outage model is proposed in this paper, which describes the deterioration and repair process of an equipment. Both the corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance are concerned in the model. The preventive maintenance in the model is considered as deterministic event, in which the start time and duration are both scheduled. Meanwhile the corrective maintenance and the unexpected failure are modeled as random events. The transient state probability and availability of equipment under preventive maintenance is derived. The effect of deterministic events on the availability of equipment is analyzed on numerical tests.

Sustainability policies planned by local authorities are aimed to increase the share of renewable energies and the reduction of fossil energies. However, intermittence and the concentration of unmanageable renewable energies in few locations may hinder the operation of the system. In order to solve these problems, energy storage plays an essential role. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effects of the introduction of two possible alternatives as a way of energy storage: pumped hydro storage and electric vehicles. For this, we use a simulation model adapted to the features of La Palma, considering different scenarios. Results show that, in the most favourable scenario, the installation of an additional 25 MW from renewables (more than double the current power), supported by 20 MW of pumped hydro storage and a fleet of 3361 electric vehicles, would allow the current share of renewables to increase from 11% (in 2015) to 49%.

However, this societal benefit may not be realized if industry actors do not have a viable business case to appropriately capture these multiple value streams. In this context, this paper investigates the value that ES may deliver to its owner over two specific business cases in a 2030 UK system. Firstly, the application of large-scale ES in the wholesale market is analysed. It is demonstrated that the optimal allocation of ES to provide multiple services is the key element for ES to become competitive in the electricity market. In the second business case, this paper analyses the value of kilowatt-scale ES combined with roof photovoltaic (PV) system in the household and community level. The study shows that multiple service provision of ES through advanced pricing schemes, for example time-of-use (ToU) tariff and dynamic distribution use of system (DUoS), lead to higher value and the coordination in the community level could further justify the application of domestic ES.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0244-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946824","Energy storage;Wind generation;Business case;Electricity market;Multiple service provision","Energy storage;Stochastic processes;Renewable energy sources;Real-time systems;Electricity supply industry;Tariffs","","","","9","","19","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is at this moment the best option for large scale storage. Switzerland has strong ambitions to further develop their PHS sector and become the battery of Europe. In this research, the potential of the Swiss PSH plants is explored, whilst taking inflow into the upper reservoirs of the PHS plants into consideration. To simulate electricity imbalance, Germany is used as a case study. Germany already has a high penetration of IRES and has plans to increase installed IRES capacity. By using an energy planning model (PowerPlan), three future scenarios of the German electricity system were designed, each with a different set of IRES installed (solar, mixed and wind). Results show that the Swiss battery ambition offers most benefits to a wind-oriented scenario, reducing both shortages as well as surpluses. Water inflow in Swiss PHS-reservoirs is of minor importance when looking at security of supply, although it was shown that the solar-scenario profits more from inflow in terms of system stability. However, a potential conflict was observed in the solar-scenario between the need for electricity storage and the storage of natural inflow, resulting in more surpluses in the system when inflow was taken into account.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0239-y","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946834","Pumped hydro storage (PHS);Local hydrology;Germany;Switzerland;Intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES);Scenarios","Electric potential;Production;Reservoirs;Europe;Renewable energy sources;Batteries;Wind","","","","3","","51","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

This methods include monitoring the suitability of relay characteristics, supervisory control of backup protection, more adaptive and intelligent system protection and the creation of novel system integrity protection scheme. The speed of response required for primary protection means that the role WAM in enhancing protection is limited to backup and system protection. The opportunities offered by WAM for enhancing protection are attractive because of the emerging challenges faced by the modern power system protection. The increasingly variable operating conditions of power systems are making it ever more difficult to select relay characteristics that will be a suitable compromise for all loading conditions and contingencies. The maloperation of relays has contributed to the inception and evolution of 70% of blackouts, thus the supervision of the backup protection may prove a valuable tool for preventing or limiting the scale of blackouts. The increasing interconnection and complexity of modern power systems has made them more vulnerable to wide area disturbances and this has contributed to several recent blackouts. The proper management of these wide area disturbances is beyond the scope of most of the existing protection and new, adaptive system integrity protection schemes are needed to protect power system security.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0211-x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939537","Backup protection;Blackouts;Hidden failures;Power system protection;System integrity protection schemes;Wide area monitoring;Wide area protection","Power system protection;Relays;Wide area measurements;Security;Monitoring;Time measurement","","","","31","","65","","23 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Using singular value decomposition (SVD) technique, the original huge phasor measurement unit (PMU) datasets are compressed to finite useful measurement data which contain critical dominant oscillation information. Further, CWT is performed on the constructed measurement signals to form wavelet coefficient matrix (WCM) at the same dilation. Then, SVD is employed to decompose the WCMs to obtain the maximum singular value and its right eigenvector. A singular value vector with the entire dilation is constructed through the maximum singular values. The right eigenvector corresponding to the maximum singular value in the singular-value vector is adopted as the input of CWT to estimate the dominant modes. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated using the simulation data from China Southern Power Grid (CSG) as well as the actual field-measurement data retrieved from the PMUs of CSG.

The unreliable results further impact downstream network and market applications, such as contingency analysis, voltage stability analysis, transient stability analysis, system alarming, and unit commitment. Thus, operators may lose the awareness of system condition in EMS.

Researches recently show that cyber-attacks might be a critical hazard to the secure and economic operations of the power system. In this paper, the influences of false data injection attack (FDIA) on the power system SSA are studied. FDIA is a major kind of cyber-attacks that can inject malicious data into meters, cause false state estimation results, and evade being detected by bad data detection. It is firstly shown that the SSA results could be manipulated by launching a successful FDIA, which can lead to incorrect or unnecessary corrective actions. Then, two kinds of targeted scenarios are proposed, i.e., fake secure signal attack and fake insecure signal attack. The former attack will deceive the system operator to believe that the system operates in a secure condition when it is actually not. The latter attack will deceive the system operator to make corrective actions, such as generator rescheduling, load shedding, etc. when it is unnecessary and costly. The implementation of the proposed analysis is validated with the IEEE-39 benchmark system.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0223-6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939531","Cyber physical power system;Static security assessment;False data injection attacks;State estimation","Power systems;Security;Transmission line measurements;State estimation;Meters;Data models;Power measurement","","","","24","","32","","23 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

This paper studies characteristics of both typical causes resulting in the practical asymmetrical voltage swell and the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) during the fault recovery. As analyzed, the fault recovery process can be divided into two continuous periods in which different control strategies have to be applied. Also protective measures are necessary in the transient period of the process. Additionally, the asymmetrical high-voltage ride-through capability and the controllability criteria of the RECS are analyzed based on eliminating the fluctuations. Furthermore, an asymmetrical control scheme is proposed to maintain the controllability of the RECS and ride through the entire recovery process. As verified by the simulation, the scheme can promise the RECS to deal with the practical fault recovery period and mitigate the dc-link voltage fluctuations, which improves the reliability of the RECS and the power system.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0177-0","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939505","Inverter;Renewable energy conversion system;Asymmetrical grid voltage;High-voltage ride-through (HVRT);Limit analysis","Circuit faults;Voltage control;Inverters;Power system stability;Transient analysis;Circuit breakers","","","","6","","35","","23 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

A robust droop control for a highvoltage microgrid is proposed based on the signal detection on the high-voltage side of the coupling transformer. For a high-voltage microgrid, the equivalent impedance of coupling transformer connecting distributed generator with the grid is usually the dominate factor. Compared with the conventional droop control strategy, the proposed control method in this paper detects the feedback signal from the high-voltage side of the coupling transformer. The impact of line impedance on the load sharing accuracy can be mitigated significantly. The proposed droop control only changes the detection point of the feedback signal, thus it is easy to be implemented.

The proposed UPQC-SRI determines the injection angle of compensation voltage with consideration of optimal configuration of UPQC current-carrying. Moreover, the compensation strategy also considers the current-carrying limit of UPQC, and then the zero active power injection region of UPQC-SRI (also called UPQC-SRI region) is obtained. Under the conditions which exceed the UPQC-SRI region, the limit value of shunt current is determined by this proposed strategy.

This paper proposes a frequency-based control strategy, ensuring the frequency among the strict limits imposed by the Standard EN 50160. The frequency of the microgrid common AC bus is determined by the energy storage converter, implementing a proposed droop curve among the state of charge (SoC) of the battery and the frequency. Therefore, the information of the SoC becomes known to every distributed energy resource (DER) of the microgrid and determines the active power injection of the converter-interfaced DERs. The active power injection of the rotating generators remains unaffected, while any mismatch among the power generation and consumption is absorbed by the energy storage system. Finally, in case of a solid short-circuit within the microgrid, the energy storage system detects the severe voltage decrease and injects a large current in order to clear the fault by activating the protection device closer to the fault. The proposed control methodology is applied in a microgrid with PVs, wind generators and a battery, while its effectiveness is evaluated by detailed simulation tests.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0178-z","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939528","Microgrid;Frequency control;Renewable energy sources;Energy storage system;SoC control","Batteries;Microgrids;Frequency control;Voltage control;Renewable energy sources;Generators","","","","23","","23","","23 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

With the steady implementation of smart grid technologies throughout the existing distribution networks, the online voltage control can be achieved ensuring the power quality and voltage levels within the statutory limits. This study presents a methodology for the estimation of voltage profile in a smart distribution network with DG for the online voltage control, taking into account different line $X/R$ ratios and laterals. This method is based on maximum and minimum voltage estimation by remote terminal units (RTUs) placed only at DG connected bus and at capacitor connected bus. Voltage regulation is carried out based on RTUs estimated values. This work is tested on two radial distribution networks with/without DGs and laterals.

The training tool (called VCath) was initially developed as a low-fidelity app for a tablet platform to provide easy access and availability to trainees. Subsequently, we have developed a high-fidelity version of VCath that uses a stereoscopic display to immerse the trainee in the virtual environment. This article reports on two studies that have been carried out to compare the low- and high-fidelity versions of VCath, particularly to assess the value of stereoscopy. Study 1 was conducted at the second annual boot camp organized for all year-one trainees in neurosurgery in the UK. Study 2 was performed on lay people, with no surgical experience. Our hypothesis was that using stereoscopy in the training task would be beneficial. Results from Study 1 demonstrated that performance improved for both the control group and the group trained with the tablet version of VCath. The group trained on the high-fidelity version of VCath with a stereoscopic display showed no performance improvement. The indication is that our hypothesis is false. In Study 2, six different conditions were investigated that covered the use of training with VCath on a tablet, a mono display at two different sizes, a stereo display at two different sizes, and a control group who received no training. Results from this study with lay people show that stereoscopy can make a significant improvement to the accuracy of needle placement. The possible reasons for these results and the apparent contradiction between the two studies are discussed.","1054-7460","","10.1162/PRES_a_00270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992987","","Training;Trajectory;Tablet computers;Measurement;Neurosurgery;Three-dimensional displays","","","","2","","","Traditional","30 Sep 2019","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

"Lumipen 2: Dynamic Projection Mapping with Mirror-Based Robust High-Speed Tracking against Illumination Changes","T. Sueishi; H. Oku; M. Ishikawa","Graduate School of Information Science and Technology The University of Tokyo Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku Tokyo 113-8656, Japan. Correspondence to Tomohiro_Sueishi@ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp; Gunma University; The University of Tokyo","Presence","30 Sep 2019","2016","25","4","299","321","Dynamic projection mapping (DPM) is a type of projection-based augmented reality that aligns projected content with a moving physical object. In order to be able to adjust the projection to fast motions of moving objects, DPM requires high-speed visual feedback. An option to reduce the temporal delay of adjusting the projection to imperceptible levels is to use mirror-based high-speed optical axis controllers. However, using such controllers for capturing visual feedback requires a sufficient amount of illumination of the moving object. This leads to a trade-off between tracking stability and quality of projection content. In this article, we propose a system that combines mirror-based high-speed tracking with using a retroreflective background. The proposed tracking technique observes the silhouette of the target object by episcopic illumination and is robust against illumination changes. It also maintains high-speed, accident-avoidant tracking by performing background subtraction in an active vision system and employing an adaptive windows technique. This allows us to create a DPM with an imperceptible temporal delay, high tracking stability and high visual quality. We analyze the proposed system regarding the visual quality of the retroreflective background, the tracking stability under illumination and disturbance conditions, and the visual consistency relative to delay in the presence of pose estimation. In addition, we demonstrate application scenarios for the proposed DPM system.","1054-7460","","10.1162/PRES_a_00275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992985","","Target tracking;High-speed optical techniques;Optical imaging;Optical control;Lighting;Visualization;Optical feedback","","","","5","","","Traditional","30 Sep 2019","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Contributors to timing uncertainty in current dSiPM scintillation detectors include: 1) routing skew and array non-uniformities, 2) SPAD dark counts and 3) scintillator statistics. A photodetector with a one-to-one coupling of timeto- digital converters (TDCs) and single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) is under study as it opens new methods to minimize the impact these contributors. However, the number of TDCs required for this coupling scheme generates a tremendous amount of data. Acknowledging these design considerations, a real-time processing scheme is proposed to minimize the bandwidth while improving the timing resolution by 1) correcting routing skews and array non-uniformities, 2) filtering dark counts and 3) estimating the time of interaction from multiple photoelectron timestamps. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the impact of the contributors to timing uncertainty and the efficiency of the proposed architecture. With a simulated 1 x 1 x 10 mm3 LYSO scintillator, the coincidence timing resolution is improved from 161 ps to 115 ps with the simulated detector.","","978-1-5090-1642-6","10.1109/NSSMIC.2016.8470061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8470061","","Timing;Detectors;Photonics;Scintillators;Routing;Clocks;Silicon","avalanche photodiodes;medical image processing;photodetectors;photomultipliers;positron emission tomography;scintillation counters;silicon","photodetector;scintillator statistics;PET;multiple photoelectron time stamps;time-to-digital converters;dSiPM scintillation detectors;3D digital SiPM;LYSO scintillator;positron emission tomography;time-of-flight measurement;digital silicon photomultipliers detectors;array nonuniformities;single photon avalanche diodes","","1","","10","IEEE","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this method, each pixel data contains phase-modulated multi-level information. When readout, the phase level of each pixel is converted to the amplitude level applied by holographic interferometry to collinear holography. This method is based on phase interference between phase-modulated signal beam and reference-phase beam (phase-lock beam); both of beams are traveled through common optical path. Using the 32-levels phase-modulated data, i.e. 5 bits phase information contained in one pixel was written and retrieved with low phase error bit [%], which is sufficient for practical use. In this paper actual optical set up for this method and write/retrieve sequence was described. Additionally, over sampling phase shifting interferometry will be discussed at the conference in order to detect phase-modulated data pages directly.","2162-1098","978-0-9600-3800-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680393","","Holography;Optical interferometry;Holographic optical components;Optical modulation;Optimized production technology;Data transfer;Adaptive optics","holographic interferometry;holographic storage;optical modulation;phase modulation;phase shifting interferometry","phase-modulated data pages;phase-locked collinear holography;pixel data;phase-modulated multilevel information;phase level;amplitude level;phase interference;phase-modulated signal beam;phase-lock beam;32-levels phase-modulated data;phase information;phase error;phase shifting interferometry;multilevel data;holographic interferometry;reference-phase beam;write-retrieve sequence","","","","5","","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A dual-wavelength photoacoustic imaging system of 532nm and 1064nm was designed and built, and experiments of cervical cancer scans on nude mice model were carried out.

However, no photovoltaic device has been reported based on this material so far, and little information on physical properties such as defect properties, Raman spectrum and temperature-dependent band gap energy is available. Here we report the first CuSbSe2 thin film solar cell (FTO/CuSbSe2/CdS/ZnO/ITO/Al) through a hydrazine-based solution process, achieving a solar power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.32%. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that CuSbSe2 has benign defect properties, i.e., free of recombination-center defects, and flexible defect and carrier concentration which can be tuned through the control of growth condition. Next, deeply systematic material, optical and electrical characterization indicates that CuSbSe2 is a very promising solar cell absorber. Finally, the obtained 1.32% preliminary efficiency further confirms the great potential of CuSbSe2 for thin-film solar cell applications.","2162-1098","978-0-9600-3800-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680320","","Photovoltaic cells;Photovoltaic systems;Films;Chemical elements;Fabrication","antimony compounds;cadmium compounds;carrier density;copper compounds;density functional theory;II-VI semiconductors;indium compounds;semiconductor thin films;solar absorber-convertors;solar cells;ternary semiconductors;tin compounds;zinc compounds","potential photovoltaic absorber material;thin-film solar cells;electrical properties;low-cost;hydrazine-based solution process;solar power conversion efficiency;density functional theory calculations;recombination-center defects;flexible defect;carrier concentration;electrical characterization;optical properties;low-toxic constituent elements;solar cell absorber;earth-abundant;systematic material;CuSbSe2-CdS-ZnO-In2O5Sn-Al","","","","0","","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Femtosecond laser direct writing has emerged as a powerful tool for fabricating innovative 3D functional structures in transparent materials, such as microresonators, optical waveguides, microfluidic channels, microelectrodes and micromechanics. The feature sizes of the fabricated structures are typically on the micrometer scale due to the difficulties in substantially breaking the diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate fabrication of 3D nanostructures deeply buried inside glass in a controllable manner. Specifically, we fabricate nanofluidic channels with a width of ~40 nm and use the fabricated nanochannels to perform single DNA molecule analysis. Our technique is based on excitation of self-induced plasmonic waves within glass using an ultrafast laser beam, which is revealed by observing the gradual formation of the nanostructure under the continuous irradiation of multiple femtosecond laser pulses. The unique characteristic allows fundamentally breaking the diffraction limit in the far-field optical nanofabrication and opens up opportunities for innovative applications such as 3D metamaterials.","2162-1098","978-0-9600-3800-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680604","","Optical diffraction;Ultrafast optics;Waveguide lasers;Glass;Three-dimensional displays;Optical device fabrication;Optical pulses","DNA;glass;high-speed optical techniques;laser beam machining;molecular biophysics;nanobiotechnology;nanofabrication;nanofluidics","innovative 3D functional structures;transparent materials;microresonators;optical waveguides;microelectrodes;micromechanics;fabricated structures;micrometer scale;diffraction limit;nanofluidic channels;fabricated nanochannels;single DNA molecule analysis;self-induced plasmonic waves;ultrafast laser beam;multiple femtosecond laser pulses;far-field optical nanofabrication;deterministic laser nanomachining;femtosecond laser direct writing;3D nanostructure;continuous irradiation;size 40.0 nm","","","","3","","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Very recently, researchers have elucidated that partial reduction by introducing the oxygen vacancies holds a chance to enhance their electric conductivity, promoting the electrochemical and catalytic performance.[7]-[9] While, with various limitations of each method itself, the modification of transition metal oxide with introducing oxygen vacancy by a new method is an effective path to tune their conductivity. In this work, we use microwave combustion system to quickly synthesize reduced metal oxides and graphene hybrid composite in several minutes. Among the as-obtained composite, the reduced orthorhombic Nb2O5 and graphene oxide (rNb2O5/rGO) has demonstrated great electrochemical performance with a reversible specific capacity of 726.2 C/g at 2 mV/s in organic electrolyte and a capacity retention of 87% after 3000 cycles at 10 A/g. This strategy with such fast reaction time could be a common route to produce oxygen vacancy in oxides, including V2O5, WO3, TiO2 etc, and satisfy much more application requirements even for the possibility of industrialization.","2162-1098","978-0-9600-3800-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680479","","Metals;Electrodes;Microwave communication;Microwave photonics;Combustion;Conductivity","electrical conductivity;electrolytes;graphene;microwave materials processing;nanocomposites;nanofabrication;niobium compounds;reduction (chemical);vacancies (crystal)","transition metal oxide;oxygen vacancy;microwave combustion system;reduced metal oxides;graphene oxide;electronic conductivity;energy conversion;photocatalysis;electric conductivity;orthorhombic structure;organic electrolyte;Nb2O5-CO","","","","9","","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Cyber-Maritime Cycle: Autonomy of Marine Robots for Ocean Sensing","F. Zhang",NA,"Cyber-Maritime Cycle: Autonomy of Marine Robots for Ocean Sensing","","2016","","","","","Marine robots are being increasingly deployed in environmental sensing and ocean observation applications. The key challenges in mobile ocean sensing are to design and control the motion of the robots to collect Lagrangian data over a large spatial domain, and then convert these Lagrangian data streams into Eulerian spatial-temporal maps for scientific and operational benefits. This monograph introduces cyber maritime cycle as a collection of feedback loops where the flow of data is regulated by functional blocks of autonomy. As a new development, the split between the data-driven cycle and the geo-scientific modeling cycle allows the separation of data streams with different time and spatial scales. This separation allows the conversion between Lagrangian and Eulerian data representations to happen more frequently for navigation of marine robots. This monograph introduces the overall systems architecture and patterns for data streams that enables autonomy for marine robots towards environmental sensing applications. It is an ideal reference for researchers, students or practitioners already doing research in this field, or planning to do so.","","9781680832334","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8637144.pdf&bkn=8637143&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","11 Feb 2019","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

It also demonstrates that a probabilistic approach to developing future efficient operating and design strategies enabled by new technologies, will appropriately balance network investment against non-network solutions while truly recognizing the effects of adverse weather, common mode failures, high impact low probability events, changing market prices for pre and post-contingency actions, equipment malfunctioning, etc. This clearly requires explicit consideration of the likelihood of various outages (beyond those considered in deterministic studies) and quantification of their impacts on alternative network operation and investment decisions, which cannot be undertaken in a deterministic, “one size fits all” framework. Through various case studies conducted on the Great Britain (GB) power network, this monograph sets out the key questions that need to be addressed in support of change in the network reliability paradigm. It provides an overview of the key modelling approaches proposed for assessing the risk profile of operation of future networks, proposes a framework for a fundamental review of the existing network security standards, and sets out challenges for assessing the reliability and economics of the operation of future electricity networks.""","","9781680831832","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8637152.pdf&bkn=8637151&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","11 Feb 2019","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"
"The Path to Path-Traced Movies","P. H. Christensen; W. Jarosz",NA; NA,"The Path to Path-Traced Movies","","2016","","","","","Path tracing is one of several techniques to render photorealistic images by simulating the physics of light propagation within a scene. The roots of path tracing are outside of computer graphics, in the Monte Carlo simulations developed for neutron transport. A great strength of path tracing is that it is conceptually, mathematically, and often-times algorithmically simple and elegant, yet it is very general. Until recently, however, brute-force path tracing techniques were simply too noisy and slow to be practical for movie production rendering. They therefore received little usage outside of academia, except perhaps to generate an occasional reference image to validate the correctness of other (faster but less general) rendering algorithms. The last ten years have seen a dramatic shift in this balance, and path tracing techniques are now widely used. This shift was partially fueled by steadily increasing computational power and memory, but also by significant improvements in sampling, rendering, and denoising techniques. The Path to Path-Traced Movies provides the reader with an overview of path tracing and highlights important milestones in its development that have led to it becoming the preferred movie rendering technique today. It identifies major hurdles that stood in the way of that transition, describing the technical milestones that pushed the field forward over the last couple of decades, and discusses the combination of circumstances that came together to propel the CG and VFX movie industry into a path-traced world. Since the journey is not yet complete, it also discusses on-going challenges and open questions that practitioners and researchers will need to address in the years to come.","","9781680832112","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8637156.pdf&bkn=8637155&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","11 Feb 2019","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

Different views are taken by different communities and the taxonomies used are hard to relate. This monograph considers the broad multi-disciplinary problem of providing sustainable and resilient electricity services. It introduces technology-agnostic unified modeling foundations and illustrates their use toward end-to-end cyber design for provable performance of complex electric energy systems. In this monograph, the role of cyber social-ecological energy systems (SEES) is formalized by using the language of large-scale dynamical systems. The key notion of interaction variables is introduced in support of their modeling as multilayered dynamical systems. It is stressed that qualitatively different cyber designs are required for enabling performance of qualitatively different SEES architectures. In particular, it is proposed that composite control-based hierarchical control lends itself more naturally to supporting large-scale regulated monopolies, and that distributed multi-layered control with or without coordination is key to supporting SEES architectures comprising many decision makers. Today’s hierarchical control is described as a particular case of hierarchical composite control. Having these formulations may help bridge R&D efforts across vastly multi-disciplinary communities working in the field of changing electric energy systems.","","9781680832273","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8637158.pdf&bkn=8637157&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","11 Feb 2019","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

This paper reports the implementation of a multi-objective based Genetic Algorithm (GA) for welding sequence optimization, in which both structural deformation and residual stress are offered equal importance. The optimal weights between them are dynamically selected through optimizing a multi-objective fitness function in an iterative manner. A thermomechanical finite element analysis (FEA) was used to predict both deformation and residual stress. We chose the elitism selection approach to ensure that the three best individuals are copied over once into the next generation to facilitate convergence by preserving good candidates which can offer an optimal solution. We exploited a sequential string searching algorithm into single point crossover method to avoid the repetition of single beads into the sequence. We utilized a bit string mutation operator by changing the direction of the welding from one bead chosen randomly from the sequence. Welding simulation experiments were conducted on a typical widely used mounting bracket which has eight seams. Multi-objective based GA effectively reduces the computational complexity over exhaustive search with significant reduction of both structural deformation (~80%) and residual stress (~15%)","","978-1-5386-7735-3","10.1109/MICAI-2016.2016.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8588054","welding deformation;multiobjective optimization;Welding Sequence Optimization;Residual stress","Welding;Heating systems;Strain;Residual stresses;Computational modeling;Optimization;Mathematical model","finite element analysis;genetic algorithms;plastic deformation;quality control;welding","residual stress;multiobjective genetic algorithm;welding sequence optimization;weld quality;structural deformation;thermomechanical finite element analysis;FEA","","","","27","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we present the development of a framework which is capable of developing an exact tracking of a person or an object and follow it autonomously. The tracking and following is performed without any help of GPS, only using the front monocular camera of the drone and the computation work is done by a laptop.","","978-1-5386-7735-3","10.1109/MICAI-2016.2016.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8588047","Unmanned Aerial Systems;Object tracking;HOG;Particle filtering","Histograms;Task analysis;Cameras;Drones;Object tracking;Streaming media;Image color analysis","autonomous aerial vehicles;image filtering;mobile robots;object tracking;particle filtering (numerical methods);robot vision;statistical analysis","particle filters;military surveillance;computer vision;sensory input;robotic platforms;aerial vehicles;histograms of oriented gradients;unmanned aerial systems;visual capacity;real-time drone object tracking","","","","9","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has resulted in the establishment of information systems such as e-supply chains (eSCs) amongst others which integrate the internet and other information and communications technology (ICT) with traditional business processes for the swift transmission of information between trading partners. Many organisations have reaped the benefits that come from adopting the eSC model, but have also faced the challenges with which it comes. One such major challenge is information security. With the current state of cybercrime, system developers are challenged with the task of developing cutting edge digital forensic readiness (DFR) systems that can keep up with current technological advancements, such as (eSCs). Hence, the problem addressed in this paper is the lack of a well-formulated DFR approach that can assist system developers in the development of e-supply chain digital forensic readiness systems. The main objective of such a system being that it must be able to provide law enforcement/digital forensic investigators (DFI) with forensically sound and readily available potential digital evidence that can expedite and support digital forensics incident response processes. This approach, if implemented can also prepare trading partners for security incidents that might take place, if not prevent them from occurring. Therefore, the work presented in this paper is aimed at providing a procedural approach that is based on digital forensics principles. This paper discusses the limitations of current system monitoring tools in relation to the kind of specialised DFR systems that are needed in the eSC environment and proposes an eSC-DFR process model and architectural design model that can lead to the development of next-generation eSC DFR systems. It is the view of the authors that the conclusions drawn from this paper can spearhead the development of cutting-edge next-generation digital forensic readiness systems, and bring attention to some of the shortcomings of current system monitoring tools.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8531546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531546","Network forensics;e-Supply Chains (eSCs);Digital forensic readiness (DFR);Cyber-Crime;e-supply chain digital forensic (eSC-DFR) system;digital forensic data analysis tools;Forensics domains;Digital Forensic Investigation (DFI)","Digital forensics;Business;Tools;Standards;Middleware","","","","4","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

However, the current paper reports on the first three activities in design science research: identifying the problem, listing solution objectives, and designing and developing a model. A comprehensive literature review serves two purposes: to confirm the problem and to provide a structured way of revealing the requirement areas. Following the uncovering of the requirement areas, CSIRT business requirements and services are introduced, before exploring the relationships between the areas using argumentation. This culminates in the development of the management model in two parts: a strategic view and a tactical view. The strategic view comprises the business requirements and “higher” level decisions – the environment, constituency and funding considerations – that need to be made when establishing a CSIRT. The tactical view follows by presenting the “how” considerations.

Although a large percentage of newly-created webshell software incorporates portions of code derived from seminal shells such as c99 and r57, they are able to disguise this by making extensive use of obfuscation techniques intended to frustrate any attempts to dissect or reverse engineer the code. This paper presents an approach to shell classification and analysis (based on similarity to a body of known malware) in an attempt to create a comprehensive taxonomy of PHP-based web shells. Several different measures of similarity were used in conjunction with clustering algorithms and visualisation techniques in order to achieve this. Furthermore, an auxiliary component capable of syntactically deobfuscating PHP code is described. This was employed to reverse idiomatic obfuscation constructs used by software authors. It was found that this deobfuscation dramatically increased the observed levels of similarity by exposing additional code for analysis.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8531543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531543","Similarity Analysis;Code Hiding;PHP Malware;Remote Access Trojan","Data visualization;Tools;Trojan horses;Process control;Decoding;Computer science","","","","4","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

This paper shows the characterization and analysis of two large datasets containing packets from NTP based DDoS attacks captured in South Africa. Using a series of Python based tools, the dataset is analysed according to specific parts of the packet headers. These include the source IP address and Time-to-Live (TTL) values. The analysis found the top source addresses and looked at the TTL values observed for each address. These TTL values can be used to calculate the probable operating system or DDoS attack tool used by an attacker. We found that each TTL value seen for an address can indicate the number of hosts attacking the address or indicate minor routing changes. The Time-to-Live values are then analysed as a whole to find the total number used throughout each attack. The most frequent TTL values are then found and show that the majority of them indicate the attackers are using an initial TTL of 255. This value can indicate the use of a certain DDoS tool that creates packets with that exact initial TTL. The TTL values are then put into groups that can show the number of IP addresses a group of hosts are targeting.

An adaptive measure of a decision support system is adopted using the point rainfall rate to predict rain-induced attenuation over three locations in the tropical region of Nigeria based on Moupfouma rain rate and attenuation model. In order to impact good Quality of Service (QoS) in the overall design of satellite communication networks, considerable efforts have to be made, such as the use of appropriate forward error correction codes, the choice of modulations and the range of uplink/downlink power controls. The IWT interacts with the input parameters to optimise the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values while the input parameters are varying. The results show that in all three locations considered, a minimum fade margin of about 12 dB on the uplink and ~ 8 dB on the downlink may be allowed at the 99.5% availability for a worst case scenario at Ka-band. Analysis based on SNR and consumed power at the same weather conditions confirms the suitability of introduction of fuzzy logic for optimum availability of good QoS in a weather impaired satellite system. The overall results would provide tolerance margins needed for better QoS, especially during bad weather in the study locations.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532238","SNR;tropical weather;Intelligent Weather Awareness Technique;satellite network","Rain;Attenuation;Mathematical model;Signal to noise ratio;Satellites;Data models","","","","4","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

In order to solve this non-convex and non-continuous multi-objective optimisation problem with the cultural algorithm, the objective function has been converted to a single objective function using a technique called price penalty factor. Four different types of penalty factors have been examined in this paper.

The Berlekamp-Massey (B-M) algorithm is used as the hard-decision decoding FEC scheme. The Koetter-Vardy (KV) algorithm is employed as the soft-decision decoding FEC scheme to maximise the error rate performance of the MIMO systems. The performance of these MIMO schemes for different channel code rates are documented through computer simulation. From the computer simulation results, it is shown that given two systems with equal overall rate, the system with the lower MIMO rate exhibits better performance due to the increased diversity.

These are spherical near-field, planar near-field and conventional far-field measurements, with the potential to implement cylindrical near-field. The antenna range potentially supports operations from 1 GHz up to 26.5 GHz, though the currently available probes do not cover the full band. The main physical upgrade was performed during October 2014, though investigations had already begun in 2011, and some supplementary tasks were still ongoing at the time of writing.

At locations along oil/pressboard interfaces in the transformer, surface discharges may initiate due to various reasons. The surface discharges may or may not eventually lead to voltage flashover faults. This paper presents a study of how relatively small surface discharges affect the lightning voltage impulse (LI) strength of oil-impregnated pressboard insulation. It is found that surface discharges of magnitudes in the order of some hundreds of pC can reduce the LI withstand voltage of the oil-impregnated pressboard by up to 15%. Although the negative polarity LI withstand voltage of surface discharge-aged pressboard is higher than that of positive polarity, the reduction in the LI voltage strength is more pronounced for the negative LI impulse voltage. The findings suggest further scrutiny of the standardised acceptable levels of PD in power transformers.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532250","Oil-impregnated pressboard;power transformers;surface discharges;lightning breakdown voltage","Partial discharges;Surface discharges;Discharges (electric);Power transformers;Electrodes;Insulation;Lightning","","","","1","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

The proposed sphere decoder operates completely in the log-domain. Additionally the effect of order in which the symbols are decoded on the computational requirements of the decoder are investigated with the authors proposing a modification of the sorted QR decomposition (SQRD) algorithm to incorporate apriori information. The modified SQRD algorithm is shown to reduce the average number of computations by up to 95%. The apriori sphere decoder is tested in an iterative multiple input multiple output (MIMO) decoder and shown to reduce the bit error rate (BER) by an order of magnitude or provide approximately a one decibel improvement.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532249","Sphere decoder;iterative decoding;MIMO;TAST;QR","Decoding;Measurement;Mathematical model;MIMO communication;Iterative decoding;Roads;Binary phase shift keying","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Therefore, it is important that rainfall measurements at shorter integration time are incorporated as useful inputs in the planning of Line-of-Sight (LOS) microwave and millimetre communication links for hosting these technologies. As compared to the use of one-minute rainfall data as suggested by International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the equivalent data measured at 30-second interval gives more information of temporal rain rates in the time domain. Therefore, in this study, rainfall rate measurements of 5-minute integration time representative of 10 locations in South Africa are evaluated to obtain their cumulative distributions. Results from these analyses are compared with rainfall data of one-minute and 30-second integration time data obtained over Durban (29°52'E, 30°55'S), South Africa. Consequently, rainfall rate models for conversion to one-minute and 30-second integration times were obtained over 10 locations in South Africa using the power-law regression functions. Our results obtained over these locations were used to estimate specific attenuation values in selected microwave and millimetric wave bands at 12 GHz, 30 GHz and 60 GHz for 10 locations under study. It is confirmed that the 30-second integration time provides more information needed for estimation of specific attenuation on microwave and millimeter-wave radio links in South Africa.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532248","Rainfall rate;integration time;rainfall rate conversion factors;specific attenuation","Rain;Attenuation;Time measurement;Microwave communication;Microwave measurement;ITU","","","","9","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Signal rotation is realized by applying a random rotation angle to the conventional signal constellation. This is followed by a second random phase rotation of the Alamouti codeword. The received signal strength levels between legitimate users are used to exchange the secret key that produces the random rotations at the receiver. This is possible due to the availability of short-term reciprocity of the radio channel. Both signal and space rotation angles are chosen such that the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the transmit signal is not increased. Firstly, we show that the rotation of the codeword alone compromises system security under receive diversity, especially when the eavesdropper is close to the legitimate user. Then, through the analysis of mutual information rate and bit error rate, we show that by the addition of signal rotation, it is possible to reduce the capacity of the eavesdropper to zero, even when receive diversity is enhanced.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532259","Alamouti scheme;secure signal and space;secret key;wireless communications","Constellation diagram;Security;Transmitting antennas;Slot antennas;Receiving antennas;Fading channels","","","","3","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

In this paper hierarchical 16-APSK is studied using a bit allocation mechanism that allows for UEP for two classes of multimedia traffic. Theoretical BER expressions are derived for two UEP bit streams using the nearest neighbourhood method in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Nakagami-m fading channels. Simulation results are then used to validate the accuracy of the theoretical expressions. A low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detection for hierarchical 16-APSK is also proposed and simulation results show that the proposed low complexity ML detector achieves the same BER performance as the optimum ML detector.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532258","Hierarchical modulation;unequal error protection;multimedia transmission","Bit error rate;Fading channels;Modulation;Resource management;Bit rate;Simulation;Complexity theory","","","","5","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

The solution requires determination of the observer gain matrix and it is formulated on the basis of the pole placement method. The contribution of the paper is in the developed bilinear dynamic models of the process and the observer and in the extending of the pole placement method for the special matrices of the bilinear observer. An analytical procedure is developed and implemented for calculation of the characteristic equation of the observer as part of calculation of the observer gain matrix. Matlab and SIMULINK software programs for determining the estimated states are developed. Investigation of the performance of the bilinear observer and the closed loop system under various constant values of the control input and different state initial conditions is performed.

The automotive industry is placing high importance on CO2 reduction technologies.Using Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery pack Stop & Start (S&S) system with combined energy regeneration is an effective technology to reduce CO2 emissions.Power supply storage is very important for the S&S system. High charging acceptance, low weight, and compact size are required. A Li-ion battery is the optimal power supply that meets these requirements. It has high charge acceptance per weight. Furthermore, we developed simple system structure which eliminates the need for the DC-DC converter. By utilizing a Li-ion battery that has voltage characteristics similar to the Pb battery there is no need for a converter to make adjustments between the two power supplies.The Li-ion battery's range of capacity must be managed appropriately as overcharge and overdischarge causes extensive damage to the battery. Therefore, battery State of Charge (SOC) is very important.We considered a method which detects open circuit voltage (OCV) while driving. The S&S system has a stable electric discharge area for a long time. The battery condition is stable in the area. By measuring in this area, and considering the frequency characteristic of the impedance of a battery, it becomes easier to detect SOC correctly even if the current sensor has an error.","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504608.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

At the end of life, the battery chemistry used to electrify the vehicle may not be easily identifiable. A simple, common identifier is required to allow consumers, service and waste management personnel to direct unknown battery types to appropriate recyclers or secondary use markets. Recyclers also benefit from this identifier as it allows them to sort, screen for potential contamination to existing process streams, and identify the manufacturer so they may contact them to find detailed information about the battery to ensure proper and safe recycling.The SAE Battery Recycling Committee has recommended that batteries be identified by battery system, miscellaneous hazards and date of manufacture be identified as part of chemistry identification code. For the lithium-ion chemistry it is further recommended that cathode and anode be specified. To avoid confusion and duplication with other standards, the SAE identifier has selected identification letters and a color background consistent with the Battery Association of Japan's (BAJ) “Guidelines for Recycle Mark on Batteries” (1).","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504785.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Thermal Behavior of Two Commercial Li-Ion Batteries for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (2014-01-1840)","A.

Therefore, a major design task is creation of a battery thermal management system with suitable control and cooling strategies. To this end, the thermal behavior of Li-ion cells at various temperatures and operating conditions should be quantified. In this paper, two different commercial pouch cells for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are studied through comprehensive thermal performance tests.This study employs a fractional factorial design of experiments to reduce the number of tests required to characterize the behavior of fresh cells while minimizing the effects of ageing. At each test point, the effects of ambient temperature and charge/discharge rate on several types of cell efficiencies and surface heat generation are evaluated. A statistical thermal ramp rate model is suggested which enables fast and accurate determination of cell surface temperature and heat generation where the vehicle is started from cold or warm environments at a range of constant currents over the entire state of charge (SOC) range.","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504856.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

This development is in line with the Nissan Green Program 2010, a medium-term environmental action plan under which the diffusion of zero-emission cars is being promoted.The lithium-ion battery is one of the key technologies of electric vehicles (EVs). The battery pack accounts for a large proportion of the EV body size, weight and cost. Therefore, achieving a smaller, lighter and less expensive battery pack suitable for global mass production on a scale comparable to vehicle mass production will be an important factor in supporting widespread diffusion of EVs.The newly developed battery pack cuts the weight and costs significantly as a result of simplifying the structures of the battery module and battery pack. The battery pack development policy is outlined below.• Downsizing and simplification of components• Reducing the number of components through parts integration• Increasing local and leading competitive country procurement rates through outsourcingThis paper describes the lithium-ion battery pack and module for global mass production and the key breakthrough technologies that made them possible.","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504481.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Development of Battery Hardware-In-the-Loop System Implemented with Reduced-Order Electrochemistry Li-Ion Battery Models (2014-01-1858)","A. Pesaran",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,"Lithium Ion Batteries in Electric Drive Vehicles","","2016","","","35","41","Aggressive battery usage profiles in electrified vehicle applications require extensive efforts in developing battery management strategy and system design determination to guarantee safe operation under every real-world driving conditions. Experiment based approaches have been widely used for battery system development, but higher costs and longer testing time restrain the number of test cases in the product development process. Battery experiments tend to be conservative to avoid inherent risks of battery failure modes under aggressive battery operation close to the capability limits. Battery Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) is an alternative way to overcome the limitations of experiment-based approaches. Battery models in the HIL should provide real-time computation capability and high (at least acceptable) prediction accuracy. Equivalent circuit model (ECM) based HILs have been used owing to their relatively good balance between computational time and prediction accuracy. However, there are difficulties in constructing compact ECM structures to capture reliable battery responses over wide ranges of State of Charge (SOC), current, and temperature. In this study, a new battery HIL platform based on reduced-order electrochemistry Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery models is developed to overcome the limitations of the ECMs in the HIL platform. Reduced-order electrochemistry battery models show an excellent balance of real-time computation capability and prediction accuracy, and they can be directly implemented in the HIL platform. HIL test results are demonstrated to show their benefits for computational time and prediction accuracy. The developed battery HIL will be used for battery system analysis and battery control development for electrified vehicles.","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504735.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Difficulty arises in accurately estimating the amount of left capacity in the battery during operation time, commonly known as battery state of charge (SOC).This paper presents a comparative study between six different Equivalent Circuit Li-ion battery models and two different state of charge (SOC) estimation strategies. The Battery models cover the state-of-the-art of Equivalent Circuit models discussed in literature. The Li-ion battery SOC is estimated using non-linear estimation strategies i.e. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the Smooth Variable Structure Filter (SVSF).The models and the state of charge estimation strategies are compared against simulation data obtained from AVL CRUISE software. The effectiveness of the models and estimation strategies is then compared through a comprehensive evaluation for model complexity, model accuracy, and root mean squared error in state of charge estimation.","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504890.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Pesaran",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,"Lithium Ion Batteries in Electric Drive Vehicles","","2016","","","13","22","Due to increasing concerns with petroleum usage and the increasing federal fuel economy regulations, electric powertrains have become more accepted by automotive manufacturers. The lithium-ion batteries employed in such systems are typically managed by an electronic battery management system (BMS). The BMS manages the battery to prevent thermal runaway and related thermal events, and is responsible for safety related functions such as thermal management, cell balancing, and controlling the connection to the vehicle's high-voltage DC bus. The ISO 26262 standard, introduced in final form in 2011, provides a framework for developing and validating automotive products that are safe from electronic and electrical system malfunctions, including BMS malfunctions, in passenger vehicles. This paper discusses options for BMS system development in accordance with ISO 26262. Hazards and risks of BMS malfunctions are identified and classified according to the standard. A concept BMS system is then developed according to ISO 26262 methodologies, including system architectures, requirements at multiple levels, and hardware architectural metrics. Architectures for battery systems design are developed and discussed, and conclusions are drawn regarding critical tradeoffs in safe battery designs for hybrid and electric vehicle application.","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504814.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Pesaran",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,"Lithium Ion Batteries in Electric Drive Vehicles","","2016","","","75","82","The emergence of Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) as a viable means of transportation has been coincident with the development of lithium-ion battery technology and electronics that have enabled the storage and use of large amounts of energy that were previously only possible with internal combustion engines. However, the safety aspects of using these large energy storage battery packs are a significant challenge to address. For example an unintentional sudden release of energy, such as through a thermal runaway event, is a common concern. Developing thermal management systems for upset conditions in battery packs requires a clear understanding of the heat generation mechanisms and kinetics associated with the failures of Li-ion batteries.Although every effort is made to avoid thermal runaway situations, there can still be upset and unforeseen instances where a cell or a pack would reach a sufficiently high temperature to initiate exothermic reaction(s) that often are initially slow to develop. Properly designed thermal management systems should be able to lower pack temperatures, effectively slowing down or stopping these exothermic reactions. On the other hand, a poorly designed system could let the temperature rise to a point where a thermal runaway becomes inevitable.In this work, a framework for assessing the efficacy of a thermal management system is presented. In particular, the cells can be tested in an Accelerating Rate Calorimeter (ARC) in order to quantify the slow exothermic reactions that are typically the precursor to a thermal runaway event. Using the test data, numerical models of the cell or cell packs, along with its thermal management system, can be developed. Specifically, a three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and an in-house one dimensional (1D) heat transfer model are proposed and their results compared. The paper shows how both the models are viable tools to simulate various thermal upset conditions and assess the performance of the thermal management in avoiding thermal runaway.","","9780768083316","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504376.pdf&bkn=8504375&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Jost",SAE International,"48-Volt Developments","","2016","","","1","22","Development of higher-voltage electrical systems in vehicles has been slowly progressing over the past few decades. However, tightening vehicle efficiency and emissions regulations and increasing demand for onboard electrical power means that higher voltages, in the form of supplemental 48 V subsystems, may soon be nearing production as the most cost-effective way to meet regulations. The displacement of high-wattage loads to more efficient 48 V networks is expected to be the next step in the development of a new generation of mild hybrid vehicles. In addition to improved fuel economy and reduced emissions, 48 V systems could potentially save costs on new electrical features and help better address the emerging needs of future drivers. Challenges to 48 V system implementation remain, leading to discussions by experts from leading car makers and suppliers on the need for an international 48 V standard. Initial steps toward a proposed standard have already been taken. So the consensus of global forecasts suggests that 48 V mild hybrids will soon come to dominate the market. Compared with 200-600 V full hybrid and battery electric vehicles, the lower-voltage approach avoids the need for high-cost safety features and large battery packs.","","9780768082715","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505522.pdf&bkn=8503596&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used in EV and HEV applications because of their high power and energy densities. During controls development of HEVs and EVs, hardware-in-the-loop simulations involving real-time battery models are commonly used to simulate a battery response in place of a real battery. One physics-based model which solves in real-time is the reduced-order battery model developed by Dao et al. [1], which is based on the isothermal model by Newman [2] incorporating concentrated solution theory and porous electrode theory [3].The battery models must be accurate for effective control; however, if the battery parameters are unknown or change due to degradation, a method for estimating the battery parameters to update the model is required. A set of manufacturer recommended battery parameters were evaluated using a numerical sensitivity analysis to evaluate their identifiability. The parameters chosen to be identified were εp, εs and brugg. The optimization algorithms that were evaluated for parameter estimation were: Self-Adaptive Evolution, Efficient Global Optimization, Differential Evolution, and Simulated Annealing. These algorithms were evaluated based on how many simulation calls were required to converge to an accuracy of 1e-4. Differential Evolution was shown to have the best performance in estimating the parameters, requiring an average of 1485 simulations to converge.","","9780768083668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504324.pdf&bkn=8504323&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

However, three main challenges need to be addressed for the accurate estimation of their state of charge (SOC) at runtime:• Long voltage relaxation time to reach its open circuit voltage (OCV) after a current pulse• Time-, temperature- and SOC-dependent hysteresis• Very flat OCV-SOC curve for most of the SOC rangeIn view of these problems, traditional SOC estimation techniques such as coulomb counting with error correction using the SOC-OCV correlation curve are not suitable for this chemistry.This work addressed these challenges with a novel combination of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm, a two-RC-block equivalent circuit and the traditional coulomb counting method. The simplified implementation of the EKF algorithm offers a computationally efficient option for runtime SOC evaluation on-board vehicles. The SOC estimation was validated with experimental data of a current profile contaminated with pseudo-random noise and with an offset in the initial condition. The model rapidly converged to within 4% of the true SOC even with imposed errors of 40% to initial SOC, 24% to current measurement and 6% to voltage measurement.","","9780768083668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504691.pdf&bkn=8504323&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Turner",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Progress in Modeling and Simulation of Batteries","","2016","","","3","11","Thermal behavior of a Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery module under a user-defined cycle corresponding to hybrid electrical vehicle (HEV) applications is analyzed. The module is stacked with 12 high-power 8Ah pouch Li-ion battery cells connected in series electrically. The cells are cooled indirectly with air through aluminum cooling plate sandwiched between each pair of cells. The cooling plate has extended cooling surfaces exposed in the cooling air flow channel. Thermal behavior of the battery system under a user specified electrical-load cycle for the target hybrid vehicle is characterized with the equivalent continuous load profile using a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) model for battery cooling. Analysis results are compared with measurements. Good agreement is observed between the simulated and measured cell temperatures. Improvement of the cooling system design is also studied with assistance of the battery cooling analyses. The results of this study demonstrate that the 3D FEA battery cooling model developed in this study can reasonably characterize thermal behavior of the Li-ion battery systems under the dynamic discharge-charge cycle. The correlated FEA model can be used to evaluate and/or optimize the cooling system designs for the battery systems with indirect air cooling.","","9780768083668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504507.pdf&bkn=8504323&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"7. Three-Dimensional Electrochemical Analysis of a Graphite/LiFePO4 Li-Ion Cell to Improve Its Durability (2015-01-1182)","J. Turner",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Progress in Modeling and Simulation of Batteries","","2016","","","59","66","Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the best candidates as energy storage systems for automobile applications due to their high power and energy densities. However, durability in comparison to other battery chemistries continues to be a key factor in prevention of wide scale adoption by the automotive industry. In order to design more-durable, longer-life, batteries, reliable and predictive battery models are required. In this paper, an effective model for simulating full-size LIBs is employed that can predict the operating voltage of the cell and the distribution of variables such as electrochemical current generation and battery state of charge (SOC). This predictive ability is used to examine the effect of parameters such as current collector thickness and tab location for the purpose of reducing non-uniform voltage and current distribution in the cell. It is identified that reducing the non-uniformities can reduce the ageing effects and increase the battery durability. Finally, it is observed that simply changing tab locations can change the degree of nonuniformity in electrochemical current generation from a max-min variation of 10 % to 3 % across the entire cell.","","9780768083668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504393.pdf&bkn=8504323&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"8. Experimental Measurements of Thermal Characteristics of LiFePO4 Battery (2015-01-1189)","J. Turner",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Progress in Modeling and Simulation of Batteries","","2016","","","67","77","A major challenge in the development of the next generation electric and hybrid electric vehicle (EV and HEV) technology is the control and management of heat generation and operating temperatures. Vehicle performance, reliability and ultimately consumer market adoption are integrally dependent on successful battery thermal management designs. In addition to this, crucial to thermal modeling is accurate thermo-physical property input. Therefore, to design a thermal management system and for thermal modeling, a designer must study the thermal characteristics of batteries. This work presents a purely experimental thermal characterization of thermo-physical properties of a lithium-ion battery utilizing a promising electrode material, LiFePO4, in a prismatic pouch configuration. In this research, the thermal resistance and corresponding thermal conductivity of prismatic battery materials is evaluated. The experiment was designed to measure the thermal conductivity of both the individual electrode layers, and the overall thermal resistance of the sealed prismatic structure. For this experiment, the first step was battery dissection, the second step was sample preparation and the third step was the measurement of thermal resistance. Thermal resistance measurements were made using specially constructed battery samples. The thru-plane thermal conductivity of LiFePO4 positive electrode and negative electrode materials was found to be 1.79 ± 0.18 W/m°C and 1.17 ± 0.12 W/m°C, respectively.","","9780768083668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504433.pdf&bkn=8504323&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

This paper presents a complete model for a li-ion battery pack. It starts from the Newman electrochemistry model to create the battery performance curves. Such information is then used for cell level battery equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameter identification. 28 cell ECMs are connected to create the module ECM. Four module ECMs are connected through a busbar model to create the pack ECM. The busbar model is a reduced order model (ROM) extracted from electromagnetic finite element analysis (FEA) results, taking into account the parasitic effects. Battery thermal performance is simulated first by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Then, a thermal linear and time-invariant (LTI) ROM is created out of CFD solution. The thermal LTI ROM is then two-way coupled with the battery pack ECM to form a complete battery pack model. Thanks to the ROM technology, such a battery pack model can finish a complete charge discharge cycle within seconds of simulation time.","","9780768083668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504404.pdf&bkn=8504323&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"9. Will Your Battery Survive a World With Fast Chargers? (2015-01-1196)","J. Turner",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Progress in Modeling and Simulation of Batteries","","2016","","","79","88","Fast charging is attractive to battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers for its ability to enable long-distance travel and to quickly recharge depleted batteries on short notice. However, such aggressive charging and the sustained vehicle operation that results could lead to excessive battery temperatures and degradation. Properly assessing the consequences of fast charging requires accounting for disparate cycling, heating, and aging of individual cells in large BEV packs when subjected to realistic travel patterns, usage of fast chargers, and climates over long durations (i.e., years). The U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Office has supported the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's development of BLAST-V-the Battery Lifetime Analysis and Simulation Tool for Vehicles-to create a tool capable of accounting for all of these factors. We present on the findings of applying this tool to realistic fast charge scenarios. The effects of different travel patterns, climates, battery sizes, battery thermal management systems, and other factors on battery performance and degradation are presented. We find that the impact of realistic fast charging on battery degradation is minimal for most drivers, due to the low frequency of use. However, in the absence of active battery cooling systems, a driver's desired utilization of a BEV and fast charging infrastructure can result in unsafe peak battery temperatures. We find that active battery cooling systems can control peak battery temperatures to safe limits while allowing the desired use of the vehicle.","","9780768083668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504626.pdf&bkn=8504323&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"7. Advantages of the Dynamic Simulation for the Thermal Management Systems Design (2014-01-2152)","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Integrated Energy Systems Analysis","","2016","","","63","70","Advance thermal management systems are being developed to optimise the energy balance within aircraft. This is being done in parallel to the concept of the More Electrical Aircraft (MEA) which has been developing throughout the last decades.The objective of such complex systems is to use efficiently the hot and cold sources available within the air vehicle to reduce the engine fuel consumption. A reduction of electrical power consumption, minimisation of weight, optimisation of aircraft aerodynamics (for example RAM inlets area minimisation) and the reduction of bleed air from engine all result in fuel consumption savings.Any thermal management system to optimise energy consumption implies complex and advanced systems. This requires a high engineering effort to design and integrate the system within an aircraft due to the large quantity of variables and interfaces that need to be taken into account.Models and simulations are essential from the beginning of the system development and design phase. However, such models are also useful along the entire system life cycle (i.e. testing, verification, in service, system modifications). They must be evolved and improved to adapt to each phase and the results need to be checked with laboratory and prototype data. In addition, the use of dynamic models over classic steady models permits designers to take into account the thermal inertias in order to dimension the systems with a more realistic behaviour in accordance to the intended operation. It also allows considering the different flight mission profiles that the air vehicle shall cope with and includes as variables the heat loads that need to be dissipated. This leads to an optimised system for the real scenario and not an oversized one against the worst case scenario.The present paper describes the use of a dynamic model to concept, dimension and design a thermal management system.","","9780768083040","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504609.pdf&bkn=8503578&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Its purpose is to understand, optimize, and validate more efficient system architectures for removing or harvesting the increasing amounts of waste heat generated in commercial and military aircraft. In the commercial aircraft industry IESA is driven by the desire to minimize airplane operating costs associated with increased system weight, power consumption, drag, and lost revenue as cargo space is devoted to expanded cooling systems. In military aircraft thermal IESA is also considered to be a key enabler for the successful implementation of the next generation jet fighter weapons systems and countermeasures. This book contains a selection of papers relevant to aircraft thermal management IESA published by SAE International. They cover both recently developed government and industry- funded thermal management IESA such as the Integrated Vehicle Energy Technology (INVENT) program, and older published papers still relevant today which address modeling approaches.","","9780768083040","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504321.pdf&bkn=8503578&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"6. Thermal Management Investigations for Fuel Cell Systems On-Board Commercial Aircraft (2013-01-2274)","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Integrated Energy Systems Analysis","","2016","","","51","61","The integration of fuel cell systems as an independent energy source (Auxiliary Power Unit, APU) requires enhanced aircraft cooling architectures. New environmental control systems and systems with an increased cooling demand are investigated in various research projects. Cooling system architectures can be designed which benefit from similar requirements, e.g. by using the same cooling loops. Additionally, an increased cooling demand makes the investigation of alternative heat sinks necessary.For detailed system investigations simulation studies are used. A model library has been created in Dymola/Modelica containing the necessary component models to simulate cooling systems. The used modeling approaches and main model information are presented in this article.In order to understand the basic system behavior a Design of Experiment (DOE) is useful. If only two or three parameters are considered, simulation studies can be performed for each possible parameter combination. Analyzing more parameters with this method is limited by the computational expense. With Latin hypercube sampling methods or low-discrepancy sequences, sampling plans with reduced sample numbers can be created.Analyzing large simulation models and identifying the most influential parameters is a time consuming work. Sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the parameters' influence on key performance indicators like mass and energy consumption. The applied sensitivity analyses are variance-based methods. By using sensitivity indices the influence of the input parameter variance on the output variance can be measured and it can be identified whether parameters are essential or unessential. A significant advantage of this variance-based method is the model-free approach.","","9780768083040","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504287.pdf&bkn=8503578&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

To accomplish this, an analysis tool that has the capability to investigate steady state and transient thermal hydraulic conditions on a component to system-wide level is employed. This is achieved by simulating the conditions within a cooling network to provide temperature, pressure and mass flow rate distributions, as well as the temperature of surrounding engine and airframe structures.With today’s reduced budgets, new aircraft systems will be less common and retrofitting existing high performance aircraft will become more common. Pushing these technologies to their thermal limits is resulting in cooling requirements that were not present or even contemplated during their original designs. As it is unlikely that airframe materials will be changed, the need to use on board fuel for cooling will become prevalent. A thermal analysis code becomes a useful and time saving tool in the identification of possible options to handle these new cooling requirements, while meeting physical size and weight limitations.","","9780768083040","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505238.pdf&bkn=8503578&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

This TMF is capable of calculating optimized control signals in real-time for thermal management systems by using model-based system knowledge. This can be either a physical model of the system or a data record generated from this model. The TMF provides control signals to the air and vapor cycle which are possible sources of cooling power, as well as load reduction or shedding signals. To determine an optimal cooling split between air cycle, vapor cycle, and its associated ram air channels, trade factors are being used to make electrical power offtake and ram air usage (i.e. drag) comparable, since both have influence on fuel consumption.An associated development process is being elaborated that enables a fast adaptation of the TMF to new architectures and systems. This will be illustrated by means of a bleedless thermal management architecture. Finally, results and expected benefits of the TMF with respect to specific fuel consumption are shown.","","9780768083040","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504657.pdf&bkn=8503578&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The overall simulation includes propulsion, power, and thermal management subsystem models, which are integrated together and linked to an air vehicle model and mission profile. The model has the capability of tracking temperatures and performance metrics and subsequently controlling characteristics of the propulsion and thermal management subsystems. The integrated model enables system-level trade studies involving the optimization of engine bleed and power extraction and thermal management requirements to be conducted.

"4. Power Thermal Management System Design for Enhanced Performance in an Aircraft Vehicle (2010-01-1805)","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Integrated Energy Systems Analysis","","2016","","","35","44","The thermal management of modern aircraft has become more challenging as aircraft capabilities have increased. The use of thermally resistant composite skins and the desire for low observability, reduced ram inlet size and number, have reduced the ability to transfer heat generated by the aircraft to the environment. As the ability to remove heat from modern aircraft has decreased, the heat loads associated with the aircraft have increased. Early in the aircraft design cycle uncertainty exists in both aircraft requirements and simulation predictions. In order to mitigate the uncertainty, it is advantageous to design thermal management systems that are insensitive to design cycle uncertainty. The risk associated with design uncertainty can be reduced through robust optimization. In the robust optimization of the thermal management system, three noise factors were selected: 1) engine fan air temperature, 2) avionics thermal load, and 3) engine thrust. The three controllable factors selected for the robust optimization were: 1) compressor pressure ratio, 2) return fuel heat exchanger (RFHX) area, and 3) recuperator heat exchanger (RHX) area. The robust optimization of the thermal management system identified the engine fan air temperature and the avionics thermal load as the dominant noise factors. The worst case noise factor combination resulted in a 258% increase in return fuel heat load. The robust optimization identified the compressor ratio as the dominant control factor followed by the RFHX area. The optimization of the controllable factors resulted in a 51% reduction in the mean return fuel heat load and a 63% reduction in return fuel heat load variance. The risk associated with design cycle uncertainty can be minimized through the employment of the robust optimization methodology.","","9780768083040","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504791.pdf&bkn=8503578&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"1. An Exergy-Based Methodology for Decision-Based Design of Integrated Aircraft Thermal Systems (2000-01-5527)","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Integrated Energy Systems Analysis","","2016","","","3","12","This paper details the concept of using an exergy-based method as a thermal design methodology tool for integrated aircraft thermal systems. An exergy-based approach was applied to the design of an environmental control system (ECS) of an advanced aircraft. Concurrently, a traditional energybased approach was applied to the same system. Simplified analytical models of the ECS were developed for each method and compared to determine the validity of using the exergy approach to facilitate the design process in optimizing the overall system for a minimum gross takeoff weight (GTW). The study identified some roadblocks to assessing the value of using an exergy-based approach. Energy and exergy methods seek answers to somewhat different questions making direct comparisons awkward. Also, high entropy generating devices can dominate the design objective of the exergy approach. Nonetheless, exergy methods do provide information to aid design providing a ready estimate for efficiency on a component and system basis. The results from the two analyses did provide similar while not exact solutions. While the paper will illustrate the methodology and its implementation, further progress is necessary to validate the hypothesis that exergybased methods are advantageous for the design of integrated systems.","","9780768083040","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504859.pdf&bkn=8503578&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

This has resulted in transient electrical power demands that require high fidelity simulations to accurately predict the peak system electrical loads. In addition, the high power electronics necessary to drive more electric system devices are generating additional heat loads, resulting in increasing demands on thermal management system performance. Consequently, integrated system simulations and the capability to optimize integrated electrical / thermal management systems are becoming necessary at earlier stages in the design cycle.

In this paper, sandwich panels with corrugated core are explored as a lightweighting concept for improved stiffness. The skin and the core materials are a high strength steel, aluminum alloy or carbon fiber-epoxy composite. The core has a triangular corrugation, a trapezoidal corrugation and a rectangular corrugation. The stiffness of the sandwich panels is analytically determined and compared with monolithic panels of equal mass.

"Optimization of High-Volume Warm Forming for Lightweight Sheet (2013-01-1170)","G. Bullen",Smart Blades Inc.,"Aluminum Auto-Body Joining","","2016","","","11","21","Traditional warm forming of aluminum refers to sheet forming in the temperature range of 200°C to 350°C using heated, matched die sets similar to conventional stamping. While the benefits of this process can include design freedom, improved dimensional capability and potentially reduced cycle times, the process is complex and requires expensive, heated dies. The objective of this work was to develop a warm forming process that both retains the benefits of traditional warm forming while allowing for the use of lower-cost tooling. Enhanced formability characteristics of aluminum sheet have been observed when there is a prescribed temperature difference between the die and the sheet; often referred to as a non-isothermal condition. This work, which was supported by the USCAR-AMD initiative, demonstrated the benefits of the non-isothermal warm forming approach on a full-scale door inner panel. Finite element analysis was used to guide the design of the die face and blank shape. The forming cell developed for the automated production trials included demonstrations of pre-heating, automation, and formability and established process repeatability, cycle time, and the formability window. Successful parts were formed with a sheet temperature in the window of 250°C +/− 10°C on a room temperature die face using material from two material suppliers. The work demonstrated that non-isothermal warm forming can enable sufficient formability to stamp a one-piece door inner panel from commodity aluminum alloys using a lower cost process that is more consistent with conventional stamping than previous warm forming proposals.","","9780768082654","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505844.pdf&bkn=8503557&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"New Adhesive Bonding Surface Treatment Technologies for Lightweight Aluminum-Polypropylene Hybrid Joints in Semi-Structural Applications (2011-01-0217)","G. Bullen",Smart Blades Inc.,"Aluminum Auto-Body Joining","","2016","","","65","78","Atmospheric pressure plasma sources are new devices for modifying the surface condition of engineering materials such as thermoplastic and thermoset-based composites. Because they operate at ambient conditions, these plasma systems can be used on a production line as a pre-treatment solution prior to painting or adhesive bonding to significantly improve adhesion strength. However, their efficient use requires sound understanding on how they modify the surface state of materials and, by the same token, how these modifications can be detected and quantified as regards their ability to provide high-strength adhesive joints. Polypropylene, since it is one of the most difficult-to-bond thermoplastic polymers and, at the same time, one of the most interesting polymers for the automotive industry (due to low cost, widespread use in the formulation of composites, lightweight and recyclability), was used in this paper as a model polymer. Because adhesive bonding opens the door to the design of hybrid structures composed of virtually any combination of dissimilar materials, often impossible to esthetically marry otherwise, the efficacy of polypropylene surface modifications using two plasma systems was tested on adhesively bonded aluminum-polypropylene hybrid assemblies. Once pre-treated using atmospheric plasma sources, the polypropylene surfaces were also analyzed using surface science techniques, namely contact angle measurements, attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. From the correlations established between the mechanical strength of adhesively bonded joints and surface features using surface science approaches, the role of surface and adhesive chemistries in providing semi-structural adhesive joints was determined. Indicators of performance for adhesive joints, based on fast infrared spectroscopy analyses, were found to be efficient for the systematic identification of promising adhesive-surface treatment combinations. The adhesion mechanisms of plasma-processed polypropylene are also presented.","","9780768082654","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505490.pdf&bkn=8503557&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Evaluation of Constitutive Behavior of Aluminum Extrusions and Their GMAW Welds (2013-01-0384)","G.

Robotic gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is currently used to weld the beam and bumper box. In order to better understand the crashworthiness of the beam, there is significant interest to obtain constitutive behavior of heat affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal.A new test procedure has been developed to couple both tensile test and shear test with the digital image correlation method to directly measure constitutive behavior of different regions in GMAW welds, namely base metal, HAZ and weld metal. The test procedure has been applied to welds of AA6060-T6 and AA6082-T6 extrusions made using conventional robotic GMAW. The results show that both AA6060-T5 and AA6082-T5 extrusions have undermatched weld metals, while in AA6082-T5 welds, the yield strength of the weld metal was even lower than the heat affected zone. Significant decreases in yield strength in HAZ in both AA6060-T5 and AA6082-T5 extrsuions were observed.","","9780768082654","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504904.pdf&bkn=8503557&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Structure to Assist in the Prevention of Bimetallic Corrosion of Hybrid Doors (2013-01-0386)","G. Bullen",Smart Blades Inc.,"Aluminum Auto-Body Joining","","2016","","","35","40","The use of low-density materials in body panels is increasing as a measure to reduce the weight of the vehicle body. Honda has developed an aluminum/steel sheet hybrid door that is more effective in reducing weight than an all-aluminum door. Because aluminum was used in the door skin, bimetallic corrosion at the connection between the aluminum and the steel sheets represented an issue. It was possible that the difference in the electrical potential of the two metals might promote corrosion at the connection between the aluminum door skin and the steel sheet door panel, in particular at the lower edge of the door, where rainwater and other moisture tend to accumulate, with the result that the appeal of the exterior of the door might decline. To address this issue, a watertight structure realized through the use of a highductility sealer was employed in order to help prevent water from infiltrating to the connection between the metals, and steel sheets with a zinc-aluminum-magnesium alloy coating, highly effective in controlling bimetallic corrosion, were employed in the door panels. This produced rust-resistance specifications for the hybrid door able to maintain durability in market use environments. This paper discusses the effect of the zinc-aluminum-magnesium alloy-coated steel sheets in controlling bimetallic corrosion.","","9780768082654","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505927.pdf&bkn=8503557&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The use of this new welding process has made it possible to realize a weight saving of 25% in the subframe against the previous model, and the stiffness of the installation points in the suspension system has been increased by 20%. This has contributed to the achievement of enhanced maneuverability. In order to apply this welding technique to mass production, a unique welding system employing a general-purpose multi-joint robot was developed, and a level of manufacturing efficiency and infrastructure investment cost equivalent to conventional MIG welding were realized.

"Characterization of Flow Drill Screwdriving Process Parameters on Joint Quality (2014-01-2241)","G. Bullen",Smart Blades Inc.,"Aluminum Auto-Body Joining","","2016","","","55","64","A state of the art proprietary method for aluminum-to-aluminum joining in the automotive industry is Resistance Spot Welding. However, with spot welding (1) structural performance of the joint may be degraded through heat-affected zones created by the high temperature thermal joining process, (2) achieving the double-sided access necessary for the spot welding electrodes may limit design flexibility, and (3) variability with welds leads to production inconsistencies. Selfpiercing rivets have been used before; however they require different rivet/die combinations depending on the material being joined, which adds to process complexity. In recent years the introductions of screw products that combine the technologies of friction drilling and thread forming have entered the market. These types of screw products do not have these access limitations as through-part connections are formed by one-sided access using a thermo-mechanical flow screwdriving process with minimal heat. The friction drilling, thread forming process, hereto referred to as “FDS,” is an automated continuous process that allows multi-material joining by utilizing a screw as both the tool and the fastener. The process uses the friction caused by the rotating screw to pierce and extrude the material. Threads are then created in this formed extrusion which allows the fastener to be screwdriven into the parts. A final torquing then securely clamps together the sheets of material. This study explores the quality design space as represented by resultant joint geometry as a function of the critical process parameters of fastener force and drilling speed. Feasible design space regions are explored to determine how process parameters affect joint geometry, and strength testing performed to validate the findings.","","9780768082654","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504998.pdf&bkn=8503557&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"An AUTOSAR-Compliant Automotive Platform for Meeting Reliability and Timing Constraints (2011-01-0448)","J. Day",John Day's Automotive Electronics,"Design and the Reliability Factor","","2016","","","33","47","High demands on advanced safety and driving functions, such as active safety and lane departure warnings, increase a vehicle's dependency on automotive electrical/electronic architectures. Hard real-time requirements and high reliability constraints must be satisfied for the correct functioning of these safety-critical features, which can be achieved by using the AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) standard. The AUTOSAR standard was introduced to simplify automotive system design while offering interoperability, scalability, extensibility, and flexibility. The current version of AUTOSAR does not assist in the replication of tasks for recovering from task failures. Instead, the standard assumes that architecture designers will introduce custom extensions to meet such reliability needs. The introduction of affordable techniques with predictable properties for meeting reliability requirements will prove to be very valuable in future versions of AUTOSAR. In this paper, we propose a new Software-Component (SWC) allocation algorithm called R-FLOW (Reliable application-FLOW-aware SW-C partitioning algorithm) for fail-stop processors to support fault-tolerance with bounded recovery times, and we integrate the R-FLOW algorithm into AUTOSAR. R-FLOW leverages different types of replication schemes to satisfy reliability and timing constraints, while offering a high degree of resource utilization and flexibility. Specifically, R-FLOW classifies real-time periodic tasks into Hard Recovery tasks, Soft Recovery tasks, and Best-Effort Recovery tasks. Hot Standbys are used for recovering from failures of hard recovery tasks, whereas Cold Standbys are utilized for recovering from failures of soft recovery and best-effort recovery tasks. With this goal in mind, we design and implement our proposed architecture within the guidelines of the current AUTOSAR framework. We have built an at-scale prototyping platform, comprising of Freescale HCS12X processing boards, a dual-channel FlexRay bus, and a CAN network. Our proposed architecture is evaluated on this platform using reliability and timeliness metrics in the context of different fault scenarios.","","9780768082685","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505508.pdf&bkn=8505166&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"About Trends in the Strategy of Development Accelerated Reliability and Durability Testing Technology (2012-01-0206)","J. Day",John Day's Automotive Electronics,"Design and the Reliability Factor","","2016","","","57","63","Accelerated Life Testing (ALT) is now the primary source for obtaining initial information for predicting a product's reliability, durability and maintainability. This paper shows that such testing fails to offer relevant information, because the product's degradation process in testing conditions differs substantially from the product's degradation process under field conditions. Consequently, the mean-time-to-failure is skewed, resulting in problems with recalls, reliability, and maintainability. Accelerated reliability and durability testing technology (ART/ADT) is an approach to the problem which can improve the situation with more accurate prediction of reliability and durability. Trends in the strategy of development of this technology include development of the ART/ADT basic components: to test by increasing step-bystep, through combined testing, the number and quality of simultaneously simulated parameters until this number approaches the actual number of parameters anticipated in the field; development testing analysis and management of degradation (failures) and their causes, with subsequent recommendation of the causes elimination; technology of accurate prediction. The above number of parameters include full input influences, safety, and human factors. The causes include cultural and scientific-technical types. This offers the potential to predict desirable field performance and thus accelerate beneficial product development. Alas, this dynamic approach to testing is seldom used. This paper shows the many reasons why and how one can overcome the obstacles.","","9780768082685","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505224.pdf&bkn=8505166&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Efficient Reliability and Safety Analysis for Mixed-Criticality Embedded Systems (2011-01-0445)","J. Day",John Day's Automotive Electronics,"Design and the Reliability Factor","","2016","","","3","19","Due to the increasing integration of safety-critical functionalities into electronic devices, safety-related system design and certification have become a major challenge. Amongst others a suitable reaction of components in case of internal errors must be ensured in order to prevent a function from failing and to guarantee a certain degree of reliability. In this context a wide variety of different fault tolerance mechanisms have been developed in the past, including analytical considerations of error coverage and resulting reliability. However, most of these mechanisms induce a certain timing overhead, which in turn might affect the realtime capabilities of the system in a negative way. More concretely, even if each error is treated adequately such that no logical failure occurs, a timing failure due to missing a deadline cannot be ruled out definitely. Thus, there is a growing need for appropriate methods to calculate the probability of timing failures and to prove that potential reliability and safety constraints are not violated.In this paper we present an analysis approach for networked systems as well as highly integrated multi-core architectures to calculate reliability with respect to timing failures. For that purpose simulation techniques are less appropriate and expensive due to the rare fault events, leading to exhaustive simulation times until results are statistically relevant. Therefore, formal methods have been developed to prove that the considered embedded real-time system is working correctly and that failure rates are bounded according to the required safety level. Further on we present an extension of the basic analysis ideas to include the influence of different error models into reliability analysis. Special emphasis is put on mixed-criticality systems, i.e. systems with applications of different safety requirements. We propose an approach to decouple the reliability analyses for these applications and to determine an individual safety integrity level for each application. Based on this approach it is possible to refine the conservative concept of IEC 61508 to take the most critical application as a basis for the whole system, enabling cost reduction and automated qualification. Based on a prototype implementation for Symtavision's SymTA/S tool suite we will show how the presented methodologies can be integrated into a safety related design flow. Based on that kind of tooling support the presented approaches can be applied for different stages of the design process, such as design space exploration and optimization as well as for verification and certification purposes.","","9780768082685","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505483.pdf&bkn=8505166&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"CAN Security: Cost-Effective Intrusion Detection for Real-Time Control Systems (2014-01-0340)","J. Day",John Day's Automotive Electronics,"Design and the Reliability Factor","","2016","","","21","31","In-vehicle networks are generally used for computerized control and connecting information technology devices in cars. However, increasing connectivity also increases security risks. “Spoofing attacks”, in which an adversary infiltrates the controller area network (CAN) with malicious data and makes the car behave abnormally, have been reported. Therefore, countermeasures against this type of attack are needed. Modifying legacy electronic control units (ECUs) will affect development costs and reliability because in-vehicle networks have already been developed for most vehicles. Current countermeasures, such as authentication, require modification of legacy ECUs. On the other hand, anomaly detection methods may result in misdetection due to the difficulty in setting an appropriate threshold. Evaluating a reception cycle of data can be used to simply detect spoofing attacks. However, this may result in false detection due to fluctuation in the data reception cycle in the CAN.We propose the “delayed-decision cycle detection” method for improving a conventional cycle detection method, which does not require modification of legacy ECUs, detects intrusions with a low misdetection rate, and prevents intrusions. We evaluated this method in a simulated environment of an actual car. The processing load of the method was sufficiently low. In some specific cases, the method resulted in misdetection. Therefore, we further improved the proposed detection method.Security architecture for in-vehicle networks should be constructed of multi-layer countermeasures to prevent single point of attacks. The proposed method can be easily applied as one layer of security architecture because it has several advantages, such as low processing load, and does not require the modification of legacy ECUs.

The motivation is clear. Up integration reduces costs, energy usage, wire harness complexity, and system bus traffic. However, when a multicore microcontroller is running different software for different applications on each of the available cores, if a fault is detected in one core the side effects and fault reactions must be contained, to prevent the fault propagating to other cores and applications. AUTOSAR version 4 does not implement any specific measures for fault containment, and, to the contrary, relies on a cooperative OS application model to work successfully. The challenge is to retain a high level of system availability but still meet the rigorous fault metrics defined in ISO 26262 by providing additional strategies for fault containment, fault classification, and function degradation. This paper describes the motivation for upintegration of functions on a domain controller ECU, shows the technologies required, and provides some solutions and workarounds for multicore microcontrollers running AUTOSAR version 4 in a mixed criticality safety system.","","9780768082685","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505635.pdf&bkn=8505166&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Reliability of Multi-Sensor Fusion for Next Generation Cars and Trucks (2014-01-0718)","J. Day",John Day's Automotive Electronics,"Design and the Reliability Factor","","2016","","","65","72","Cars and trucks today are getting fitted with a large number of sensors in an effort to improve safety, comfort, fuel economy and emissions. The revenue from the automotive sensors market, driven by intense global competition and regulation, is expected to double over the next decade, while the size of the automotive sensors market, over the same period, is expected to triple.The field of sensor-fusion is highly multi-disciplinary, making use of technics from artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, digital signal processing, control theory, and statistical estimation. Sensor-fusion strategies based on probability theory, evidence theory, fuzzy theory, and possibility theory are being explored in different industries, e.g., defense, robotics, automotive, etc. The majority of sensor-fusion operators are based on optimistic assumptions about reliability of the information generated by the sensors. However, many or all sensors in a fused sensor system may exhibit substantially different reliability levels over the life of a vehicle, and it is necessary to account for this variation/degradation to avoid any decrease in performance of the fusion results. Many of the automotive sensor applications are tightly tied with safety critical actuation systems which need to perform control actions reliably over the entire life of the car or the truck. The safe and reliable control of the vehicles requires that as different sensors change in their performance capability and reliability, over the course of the life of the vehicle, the sensor fusion strategies take the sensor system changes into account adequately in order to maintain an acceptable level of reliability of the fusion results.A large part of sensor-fusion literature relies on the strong assumption that the sensors producing the fused data operate according to a predetermined characteristic at all times. Applications and investigations related to monitoring of reliability of a number of fused sensors, as the performance of the sensors varies with time, including sensor failure, have been reported relatively infrequently. This paper presents an overview of sensor-fusion investigations in the automotive arena and the relatively small body of work concerned with reliability of sensor-fusion. The paper also highlights the role of Evidence theory in forming the foundation for sensor-fusion reliability developments that could help car and truck makers realistically take advantage of the growing volume of sensors in their products.","","9780768082685","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505287.pdf&bkn=8505166&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

For it, the real cases lessons learned are discussed looking for opportunities for future failure mode avoidance practices such as: a) derating for electronic components aiming to reduce the probability of the stress to exceed the strength of the part, b) worst-case circuit analysis (WCCA) i.e. under extreme environment or operating conditions and finally, c) the distinction between Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) and Design for Reliability (DfR).","","9780768082685","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8505369.pdf&bkn=8505166&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

"Evaluation of System Configurations for Downsizing a Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine for Non-Road Applications (2016-01-8058)","K. Jost; C. Sandu; R. Gehm",NA; NA; NA,"The Best of COMVEC 2016 Select Technical Papers from the SAE Commercial Vehicle Engineering Congress","","2016","","","23","36","In recent years there has been a successful application of engine downsizing in the passenger car market, using boosting technologies to achieve higher specific power and improve fuel economy. Downsizing has also been applied in heavy-duty diesel engines for the on-highway market to improve fuel economy, motivated in part by CO2 emission limits in place under Phase 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) legislation. In the non-road market, with Tier 4 emission standards already being met and no current plan for a GHG emission requirement, there has been less activity in engine downsizing and the drivers for this approach may be different from their on-highway counterparts. For instance, manufacturers may consider emission regulation break points as a motivation for engine displacement targets.Many non-road applications demand a relatively high low-end torque and support the use of higher displacement engines. For these applications it can be more challenging to apply downsizing strategies while meeting the operation requirements of the machine, such as load factor. However, if successful, downsizing in these applications and reducing the engine size can provide improvements in fuel economy, reduce purchase price and provide packaging and machine layout improvement opportunities.This work focuses on the application of downsizing in heavy-duty diesel engines applied to specific non-road applications where the opportunity exists to reduce the number of cylinders and thus the overall size of the engine. The main drivers here are packaging, production cost and fuel consumption. Various technologies, such as electrically assisted turbocharger, two-stage turbocharging, asymmetric twin scroll turbine and variable valve actuation, will be investigated to maintain performance requirements while reducing the number of cylinders.","","9780768083903","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504296.pdf&bkn=8503663&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

A piston compression height reduction in combination with carbon based piston pin coatings is enabling advancements in both demands. MAHLE implemented a new innovative metal joining technology by using laser welding to generate a cooling gallery. The MonoLite concept offers design flexibility which cannot be matched by any other welding process. Especially an optimum design and position of the cooling gallery as well as durability for very high peak cylinder pressures can be matched. This is particularly advantageous for complex combustion bowl geometries that are needed in modern diesel engines to meet fuel economy and emission requirements. The MonoLite steel piston technology offers a superior compression height reduction potential compared to typical friction welded designs. Using this benefit to reduce side forces by a longer connecting rod, the full friction reduction potential is achieved by a combination with a new low friction carbon based coating on the piston pin. The new coating shows best-in-class performance in terms of friction and high temperature resistance compared to currently available pin coatings.The shorter compression height also results in reduced oscillating masses. This can be used for further weight reduction in the whole drivetrain, which allows the implementation of further systems for better fuel efficiency, e.g. waste heat recovery, without reducing payload.","","9780768083903","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504293.pdf&bkn=8503663&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The objective of this work is to demonstrate a method to optimize fan-shroud shape in order to maximize cooling air mass flow rates through the heat exchangers using the Adjoint Solver in STAR-CCM+®. Such techniques using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis enable the automotive/transport industry to reduce the number of costly experiments that they perform. This work presents the use of CFD as a simulation tool to investigate and assess the various factors that can affect the vehicle thermal performance.In heavy-duty trucks, the cooling package includes heat exchangers, fan-shroud, and fan. In this work, the STAR-CCM+® solver was selected and a java macro built to run the primal flow and the Adjoint solutions sequentially in an automated fashion. In this analysis, the primal flow provides flow information (e.g. velocity, temperature and pressure) and the Adjoint solver provides surface morphing details w.r.t. max or min of the specified objective function. In the present work, the fan-shroud surface morphing was performed based on the maximum air mass flow rate through the heat exchanger outlet w.r.t. the spatial positions of the fan-shroud surface. An overall 1.4% increase in cooling air mass flow was observed in the heat exchanger with the optimized/morphed fan-shroud surface. The identified main optimized locations were mainly at the sharp edges of the original manufactured fan-shroud. Further evaluation is underway to maximize the cooling air mass flow benefit.","","9780768083903","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504624.pdf&bkn=8503663&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Many cyber security experts and analysts are used to working with traditional information technology (IT) networks and are familiar with a set of technologies that may not be directly useful in the commercial vehicle sector. To help connect security researchers to heavy trucks, a remotely accessible testbed has been prototyped for experimentation with security methodologies and techniques to evaluate and improve on existing technologies, as well as developing domain-specific technologies. The testbed relies on embedded Linux-based node controllers that can simulate the sensor inputs to various heavy vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). The node controller also monitors and affects the flow of network information between the ECUs and the vehicle communications backbone. For example, a node controller acts as a clone that generates analog wheel speed sensor data while at the same time monitors or controls the network traffic on the J1939 and J1708 networks. The architecture and functions of the node controllers are detailed. Sample interaction with the testbed is illustrated, along with a discussion of the challenges of running remote experiments. Incorporating high fidelity hardware in the testbed enables security researchers to advance the state of the art in hardening heavy vehicle ECUs against cyber-attacks. How the testbed can be used for security research is presented along with an example of its use in evaluating seed/key exchange strength and in intrusion detection systems (IDSs).","","9780768083903","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504496.pdf&bkn=8503663&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The coastdown test procedure is the primary reference method employed to assess vehicle drag currently, while other valid alternatives include constant speed testing, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and wind tunnel testing.The main purpose of this paper is to compare CFD simulations with a corresponding 1/8th scale wind tunnel test. Additionally, this paper will highlight the impacts of wind tunnel testing on the total drag coefficient performance as compared to full scale open road analysis with and without real world, upstream turbulence wind conditions.All scale model testing and CFD simulations were performed on a class 8 tractor with a standard 53-foot dry-box trailer. The wind tunnel testing was performed in the Auto Research Center (ARC) wind tunnel. The CFD simulations were performed using PowerFLOW, a Lattice Boltzmann based method solver, on a high fidelity geometric model. Scale model CFD results were also compared to full scale CFD simulations performed in an open road configuration at full scale Reynolds number, with and without real world conditions, to highlight differences between each of the evaluation environments.","","9780768083903","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504389.pdf&bkn=8503663&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Pneumatically Shifted Air Suspension Loading for Improved Fuel Economy Benefits (2016-01-8031)","K. Jost; C. Sandu; R. Gehm",NA; NA; NA,"The Best of COMVEC 2016 Select Technical Papers from the SAE Commercial Vehicle Engineering Congress","","2016","","","37","43","Since the introduction of electronically controlled air suspension (ECAS) systems in the nineties, no major improvements have been made in the realm of controlling air suspensions in the heavy duty truck market. Despite the lack of improvement, a need exists for intelligently controlled air suspension systems, specifically systems which can be applied to 6x2 axle configurations in the North American market. This study outlines a concept proposal for a novel suspension control concept which encompasses traction control capabilities in addition to suspension control for improved fuel efficiency benefit. The major novelty of the concept is that, by utilizing specific axle configurations and tires, a shift in pressure from the driven to the non-driven axles may result in improvements in the overall fuel economy of the vehicle. The shift in pressure will allow ride height to be maintained while increasing fuel economy benefits if the tires used on the non-driven axles have lower rolling resistances than the tires used on the driven axles. To demonstrate the hypothesized benefits of the system, an estimate of fuel economy was derived through theoretical calculations and known data. Physical testing was conducted to verify the theoretical results. Fuel savings opportunities were identified through the calculated estimates and were further confirmed by full vehicle track tests. Tractors equipped with certain axle configurations (e.g. 6x2 axles) and tires (e.g. trailer tires on the non-driven axle) will experience a noticeable improvement in fuel economy which will ultimately lower fuel costs for operators and reduce the environmental impact of commercial vehicles.","","9780768083903","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504798.pdf&bkn=8503663&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Commensurate heat sinks capable of absorbing this load are the crucial element in an aircraft's thermal management system, and so the capacities of heat sinks must evolve with this electronics growth. This paper presents an industry survey of conventional heat sinks in current use and then introduces and discusses potential advances in heat sink technologies.

"7. Thermal Management and Power Generation for Directed Energy Weapons (2010-01-1781)","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Systems Architectures","","2016","","","61","67","Two recent studies highlight the unique cooling requirements of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) and identify methods to address these requirements. Both systems generate substantial heat loads, one requiring more than 1 MW of cooling. Furthermore, much of the heat is generated within a small volume, resulting in a high heat flux. Both spray cooling with ammonia and microchannel heat exchangers with de-ionized water or ammonia were considered. In each case it was determined that the ultimate heat sink would be the ambient air. In one study the heat transfer process was more challenging due to a relatively narrow allowable temperature range and a maximum allowable temperature near the ambient air temperature. Heat transfer options considered the use of a liquid loop with either direct ram air cooling, an air cycle cooling system, and a vapor cycle cooling system. The latter options provided greater differential temperatures between the working fluid and ambient air, resulting in smaller and lighter systems at the expense of increased cooling system power requirements.Since neither of the systems studied operates continuously, the size and weight of some of the heat transfer components could be reduced by incorporating thermal storage capacity in the systems. For the duty cycles studied, the savings in overall system weight, size, drag, and power required was substantial. A thermal storage unit utilizing a paraffin-based phase-change material was developed and tested. Test results validated the performance models.Methods of power generation for DEW systems are also considered. Approaches include the use of existing power generation systems combined with batteries, high-power engine-mounted generators, bleed-air-driven generators, a novel bleed and burn concept, propellant power systems, ram air turbines, and generators driven by an auxiliary gas turbine engine.","","9780768082975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504752.pdf&bkn=8503523&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Introduction","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Systems Architectures","","2016","","","1","1","Aircraft thermal management (ATM) is increasingly important to the design and operation of commercial and military aircraft due to rising heat loads from expanded electronic functionality, electric systems architectures, and the greater temperature sensitivity of composite materials compared to metallic structures. It also impacts engine fuel consumption associated with removing waste heat from an aircraft. More recently the advent of more electric architectures on aircraft, such as the Boeing 787, has led to increased interest in the development of more efficient ATM architectures by the commercial airplane manufacturers. The ten papers contained in this book describe aircraft thermal management system architectures designed to minimize airplane performance impacts which could be applied to commercial or military aircraft. Additional information on Aircraft Thermal Management System Architectures is available from SAE AIR 5744 issued by the AC-9 Aircraft Environmental System Committee and the SAE book Aircraft Thermal Management Integrated Analysis (PT-178).

These improvements will require a more efficient, more reliable, and more advanced propulsion system. The concept of smart components is built around actively controlling the engine and the aircraft to operate optimally. Usage of smart components intelligently increases efficiency and system safety throughout the flight envelope, all while meeting environmental challenges. This approach requires an integration and optimization, both at the local level and the system level, to reduce cost. Interactions between the various subsystems must be understood through the use of modeling and simulation. This is accomplished by starting with individual subsystem models and combining them into a complete system model. Hierarchical, decentralized control reduces cost and risk by enabling integration and modularity. This process involves defining, developing, and validating against requirements for key integrated propulsion, power, and thermal management system capabilities.","","9780768082975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504770.pdf&bkn=8503523&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Systems Architectures","","2016","","","87","97","Advances in aircraft technology have brought about a necessity for new aircraft thermal management architectures in order to maintain reasonable cost, size, weight, and power requirements of the overall thermal system. Two-phase cooling technologies such as vapor-compression systems have demonstrated significant benefits and offer a serious option for emerging new aircraft thermal management applications. Although vapor-compression technology offers a steady state solution to many of the limitations of existing aircraft thermal management systems, industry concerns about transient behavior need to be addressed. The purpose of this research was to investigate transient effects on the vapor compression system when the majority of the onboard thermal loads are cooled directly with the vapor-compression system and how these systems operate under the rapid thermal transients that a military aircraft experiences during combat missions.Within this overall study, an experimental investigation was performed to evaluate the transient capabilities of a vapor-compression thermal bus while also rejecting waste heat to variable environmental conditions representative of the conditions experienced during a combat mission. For this analysis, a vapor-compression thermal bus was developed to directly cool four independent, high-heat-flux thermal loads. The system was then evaluated for its ability to react to the changing conditions, maintain a uniform temperature at the cooled components, and maintain desirable fluid conditions at the inlet to the system’s compressor. In addition, the effects and penalties of a recuperative heat exchanger as a method to improve reliability (through increased compressor inlet superheat) was also experimentally evaluated.In prior publications, the authors have discussed the Heat Pump Loop Thermal Bus and the advantages of using the individual throttling valves at the inlet of each cold plate to control the exit superheat from each individual cold plate. However, industry concerns about the ingestion of transient liquid slugs of refrigerant by the compressor and the concern that possibly a liquid-vapor separator at the inlet of the compressor was required were a primary reason for these demonstration experiments. During experiments, operation without accumulation of liquid upstream of the compressor was maintained. This was done while autonomously managing the superheat at the exit of each cold plate, maintaining a near uniform temperature through the cold plates, and operating efficiently by controlling the speed of the compressor. Through this evaluation, it has been shown that vapor-compression technology can operate reliably with both transient thermal loading conditions and transient environmental conditions that can be expected during military air combat operations.","","9780768082975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504470.pdf&bkn=8503523&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Systems Architectures","","2016","","","23","33","The integration of fuel cell systems as an independent energy source (Auxiliary Power Unit, APU) requires enhanced aircraft cooling architectures. New environmental control systems and systems with an increased cooling demand are investigated in various research projects. Cooling system architectures can be designed which benefit from similar requirements, e.g. by using the same cooling loops. Additionally, an increased cooling demand makes the investigation of alternative heat sinks necessary.For detailed system investigations simulation studies are used. A model library has been created in Dymola/Modelica containing the necessary component models to simulate cooling systems. The used modeling approaches and main model information are presented in this article.In order to understand the basic system behavior a Design of Experiment (DOE) is useful. If only two or three parameters are considered, simulation studies can be performed for each possible parameter combination. Analyzing more parameters with this method is limited by the computational expense. With Latin hypercube sampling methods or low-discrepancy sequences, sampling plans with reduced sample numbers can be created.Analyzing large simulation models and identifying the most influential parameters is a time consuming work. Sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the parameters' influence on key performance indicators like mass and energy consumption. The applied sensitivity analyses are variance-based methods. By using sensitivity indices the influence of the input parameter variance on the output variance can be measured and it can be identified whether parameters are essential or unessential. A significant advantage of this variance-based method is the model-free approach.","","9780768082975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504410.pdf&bkn=8503523&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"6. A Highly Stable Two-Phase Thermal Management System for Aircraft (2012-01-2186)","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Systems Architectures","","2016","","","51","60","Future electronics and photonics systems, weapons systems, and environmental control systems in aircraft will require advanced thermal management technology to control the temperature of critical components. Two-phase Thermal Management Systems (TMS) are attractive because they are compact, lightweight, and efficient. However, maintaining stable and reliable cooling in a two-phase flow system presents unique design challenges, particularly for systems with parallel evaporators during thermal transients. Furthermore, preventing ingress of liquid into a vapor compressor during variable-gravity operation is critical for long-term reliability and life. To enable stable and reliable cooling, a highly stable two-phase system is being developed that can effectively suppress flow instability in a system with parallel evaporators. Flow stability is achieved by ensuring that only single-phase liquid enters the evaporators. The two-phase flow leaving the evaporators flows through a membrane phase separator to produce a liquid stream and a vapor stream. The liquid stream recirculates at low pressure, drawn back to the evaporator inlets by the suction produced in an ejector pump with no moving parts. The vapor streams from the phase separators flow back to the compressor. Flow restrictors at the inlet to each evaporator enhance stability by ensuring that most of the pressure drop in each parallel leg is due to single-phase flow through the restrictor. This paper presents performance data for key components in the system, as well as analysis results for flow restrictors to prevent dryout in evaporators due to flow redistribution associated with heat load variation.","","9780768082975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504875.pdf&bkn=8503523&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

The INVENT (INtegrated Vehicle ENergy Technology) program has been dedicated to this endeavor through modeling/simulation of thermal management, power generation & distribution, & actuation subsystems. Achieving dual cooling & power generation capability from a single subsystem would be consistent with current efforts in system integration optimization.In this paper, we present a reconfiguration of an archetypal closed-loop air cycle system for a modern fighter as an open-loop gas generator cycle operating interchangeably between refrigeration and auxiliary power modes. A numerical model was developed within NPSS to assess maximum power extraction capabilities of a system originally designed for cooling purposes under different operating conditions. Presented results demonstrate variations in maximum power extraction, flow rates, and turbomachinery performance parameters over a range of flight altitudes and Mach numbers. Finally, the effect of variable area nozzle operation for the power turbine was explored at sea level static conditions and was found to improve system power extraction capability.","","9780768082975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504484.pdf&bkn=8503523&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"
"Aircraft Thermal Management: Systems Architectures","M. Ahlers",Boeing Commercial Airplanes,"Aircraft Thermal Management: Systems Architectures","","2016","","","i","vii","Aircraft thermal management (ATM) is increasingly important to the design and operation of commercial and military aircraft due to rising heat loads from expanded electronic functionality, electric systems architectures, and the greater temperature sensitivity of composite materials compared to metallic structures. It also impacts engine fuel consumption associated with removing waste heat from an aircraft. More recently the advent of more electric architectures on aircraft, such as the Boeing 787, has led to increased interest in the development of more efficient ATM architectures by the commercial airplane manufacturers. The ten papers contained in this book describe aircraft thermal management system architectures designed to minimize airplane performance impacts which could be applied to commercial or military aircraft. Additional information on Aircraft Thermal Management System Architectures is available from SAE AIR 5744 issued by the AC-9 Aircraft Environmental System Committee and the SAE book Aircraft Thermal Management Integrated Analysis (PT-178). SAE AIR 5744 defines the discipline of aircraft thermal management system engineering while Aircraft Thermal Management Integrated Analysis discusses approaches to computer simulation of the simultaneous operation of all systems affecting thermal management on an aircraft.","","9780768082975","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8504380.pdf&bkn=8503523&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAE","SAE eBook Chapters"

Such theories allow to reason about systems on a component-by-component basis, and to characterize substitutability as a refinement relation. Although compositional theories of feedback do exist, they are limited either to deterministic systems (functions) or input-receptive systems (total relations). In this work we propose a compositional theory of feedback which applies to non-deterministic and non-input-receptive systems (e.g., partial relations). To achieve this, we use the semantic frameworks of predicate and property transformers, and relations with fail and unknown values. We show how to define instantaneous feedback for stateless systems and feedback with unit delay for stateful systems.

More precisely, given two HMCs and an observation sequence, a distinguishing algorithm is expected to identify the HMC that generates the observation sequence. Two HMCs are called distinguishable if for every ε > 0 there is a distinguishing algorithm whose error probability is less than ε. We show that one can decide in polynomial time whether two HMCs are distinguishable. Further, we present and analyze two distinguishing algorithms for distinguishable HMCs. The first algorithm makes a decision after processing a fixed number of observations, and it exhibits two-sided error. The second algorithm processes an unbounded number of observations, but the algorithm has only one-sided error. The error probability, for both algorithms, decays exponentially with the number of processed observations.

In Section 2 we give a general overview of Stone duality in its various forms: for Boolean algebras, distributive lattices, and frames. For distributive lattices, we discuss both Stone and Priestley duality. We identify how to move between the different dualities and which dual spaces carry the Scott topology. We then focus on three themes.The first theme is additional operations on distributive lattices and Boolean algebras. Additional operations arise in denotational semantics in the form of predicate transformers. In verification they occur in the form of modal operators. They play an essential rôle in Eilenberg’s variety theorem in the form of quotient operations. Quotient operations are unary instantiations of residual operators which are dual to the operations in the profinite algebras of algebraic language theory. We discuss additional operations in Section 3.The second theme is that of hyperspaces, that is, spaces of subsets of an underlying space. Some classes of algebras may be seen as the class of algebras for a functor. In the case of predicate transformers the dual functors are hyperspace constructions such as the Plotkin, Smyth, and Hoare powerdomain constructions. The algebras-for-a-functor point of view is central to the coalgebraic study of modal logic and to the solution of domain equations. In the algebraic theory of formal languages various hyperspace-related product constructions, such as block and Schützenberger products, are used to study complexity hierarchies. We describe a construction, similar to the Schützenberger product, which is dual to adding a layer of quantification to formulas describing formal languages. We discuss hyperspaces in Section 4.The final theme is that of ""equations"". These are pairs of elements of dual spaces. They arise via the duality between subalgebras and quotient spaces and have provided one of the most successful tools for obtaining decidability results for classes of regular languages. The perspective provided by duality allows us to obtain a notion of equations for the study of arbitrary formal languages. Equations in language theory is the topic of Section 5.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576455","Stone duality;denotational semantics;modal logic;algebraic theory of formal languages;logic on words","Boolean algebra;Lattices;Semantics;Formal languages;Complexity theory","Boolean algebra;decidability;duality (mathematics);formal languages;group theory;mathematical operators;process algebra;programming language semantics;set theory;topology","dual spaces;quotient spaces;regular languages;arbitrary formal languages;computer science;Stone duality;formal language theory;Boolean algebras;distributive lattices;predicate transformers;modal operators;quotient operations;residual operators;profinite algebras;algebraic language theory;underlying space;dual functors;hyperspace-related product constructions;denotational semantics","","","","69","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this algebraic reformulation, usual distinctions between graph observables (real-valued maps on the set of graphs defined by counting subgraphs) and rules disappear. Instead, natural algebraic substructures of R arise: formal observables are seen as rules with equal left and right hand sides and form a commutative subalgebra, the ones counting subgraphs forming a sub-subalgebra of identity rules. Actual graph-rewriting is recovered as a canonical representation of the rule algebra as linear operators over the vector space generated by (isomorphism classes of) finite graphs. The construction of the representation is in close analogy with and subsumes the classical (multi-type bosonic) Fock space representation of the HeisenbergWeyl algebra. This shift of point of view, away from its canonical representation to the rule algebra itself, has unexpected consequences. We find that natural variants of the evaluation morphism map give rise to concepts of graph transformations hitherto not considered. These will be described in a separate paper [2]. In this extended abstract we limit ourselves to the simplest concept of double-pushout rewriting (DPO). We establish “jump-closure”, i.e. that the subspace of representations of formal graph observables is closed under the action of any rule set. It follows that for any rule set, one can derive a formal and self-consistent Kolmogorov backward equation for (representations of) formal observables.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576475","concurrency;probabilistic systems;graph rewriting","Algebra;Mathematical model;Stochastic processes;Concurrent computing;Engines;Syntactics;Computational modeling","algebra;formal languages;graph grammars;graph theory;mathematical operators;rewriting systems;stochastic processes;vectors","stochastic graph-rewriting;Heisenberg-Weyl algebra;canonical representation;unital noncommutative algebra;algebraic reformulation;natural algebraic substructures;graph transformations;formal graph observables;linear operators;vector space generation;double-pushout rewriting;DPO;Fock space representation","","","","15","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we study the problem of minimizing symbolic tree automata. First, we formally define and prove the properties of minimality in the symbolic setting. Second, we lift existing minimization algorithms to symbolic tree automata. Third, we present a new algorithm based on the following idea: the problem of minimizing symbolic tree automata can be reduced to the problem of minimizing symbolic (string) automata by encoding the tree structure as part of the alphabet theory.

When hybrid systems are complicated, it is useful to prove properties about simpler and related sub-systems before tackling the system as a whole. 2. Some models of hybrid systems can be implementation-specific. Verification can be aided by abstracting the system down to the core components necessary for safety, but only if the relations between the abstraction and the original system can be guaranteed. 3. One approach to taming the complexities of hybrid systems is to start with a simplified version of the system and iteratively expand it. However, this approach can be costly, since every iteration has to be proved safe from scratch, unless refinement relations can be leveraged in the proof. 4. When proofs become large, it is di cult to maintain a modular or comprehensible proof structure. By using a refinement relation to arrange proofs hierarchically according to the structure of natural subsystems, we can increase the readability and modularity of the resulting proof. dRℒ extends an existing specification and verification language for hybrid systems (differential dynamic logic, dℒ) by adding a refinement relation to directly compare hybrid systems. This paper gives a syntax, semantics, and proof calculus for dRℒ. We demonstrate its usefulness with examples where using refinement results in easier and better-structured proofs.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576401","","Cognition;Safety;Semantics;Calculus;Syntactics;Mathematical model;Continuous time systems","formal logic;iterative methods;program verification;theorem proving","differential refinement logic;refinement relation;hybrid systems;dRℒ;proof calculus","","","","27","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We further show that, when only polynomial induction is used, quasipolynomialsize normal deep inference proofs may be obtained, via a graph-rewriting normalisation procedure from earlier work. For the intuitionistic setting we calibrate the PW translation with the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of intuitionistic implication to recover a transformation to monotone proofs. By restricting type level we are able to identify an intuitionistic theory, I1U21, for which the transformation yields quasipolynomialsize monotone proofs.

This paper lays a comprehensive foundation for this form of rewriting. We interpret diagrams combinatorially as typed hypergraphs and establish the precise correspondence between diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs on the one hand and double pushout (DPO) rewriting of hypergraphs, subject to a soundness condition called convexity, on the other. This result rests on a more general characterisation theorem in which we show that typed hypergraph DPO rewriting amounts to diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs with a chosen special Frobenius structure.

The advantage of non-recursive HITs is that their elimination principles are easier to apply than those of general HITs.It is an open question which classes of HITs can be encoded as non-recursive HITs. One result of this paper is the construction of the propositional truncation via a sequence of approximations, yielding a representation as a non-recursive HIT. Compared to a related construction by van Doorn, ours has the advantage that the connectedness level increases in each step, yielding simplified elimination principles into n-types. As the elimination principle of our sequence has strictly lower requirements, we can then prove a similar result for van Doorn's construction.

"Effective Brenier Theorem : Applications to Computable Analysis and Algorithmic Randomness","A.

It postulates existence, monotonicity and uniqueness of an optimal map, with respect to the quadratic cost function, between two given probability measures (under some weak regularity conditions). We prove an effective version of Brenier's theorem: we show that for any two computable absolutely continuous measures on ℝn, μ and ν, with some restrictions on their support, there exists a computable convex function φ, whose gradient ∇φ is the optimal transport map between μ and ν.The main insight of the paper is the idea that an effective Brenier's theorem can be used to construct effective monotone maps on ℝn with desired (non-)differentiability properties. We use it to solve several problems at the interface of algorithmic randomness and computable analysis. In particular, we show that z ∈ ℝn is computably random if and only if every computable monotone function on ℝn is differentiable at z. Furthermore, we prove the converse of the effective Aleksandrov theorem (Galicki 2015): we show that if z ∈ ℝn is not computably random, there exists a computable convex function that is not twice differentiable at z.Finally, we prove several new characterisations of computable randomness in ℝn: in terms of differentiability of computable measures, in terms of a particular Monge-Ampère equation and in terms of critical values of computable Lipschitz functions.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576459","Algorithmic Randomness;Computable Analysis;Optimal Transport;Differentiability","Convex functions;Mathematical model;Convergence;Cost function;History;Economics;Government","computability;computational complexity;convex programming;optimisation;probability;random processes;set theory;theorem proving","computable analysis;algorithmic randomness;quadratic cost function;optimal transport map;differentiability properties;computable randomness;computable measures;computable Lipschitz functions;probability measures;regularity conditions;convex function;Brenier theorem;monotone maps;Aleksandrov theorem;Monge-Ampère equation","","","","32","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose confusion-free event structures over an alphabet with a justification relation as a model. Executions are modeled by justified configurations, where every read event has a justifying write event. Justification alone is too weak a criterion, since it allows cycles of the kind that result in so-called thin-air reads. Acyclic justification forbids such cycles, but also invalidates event reorderings that result from compiler optimizations and dynamic instruction scheduling. We propose a notion well-justification, based on a game-like model, which strikes a middle ground.We show that well-justified configurations satisfy the DRF theorem: in any data-race free program, all well-justified configurations are sequentially consistent. We also show that rely-guarantee reasoning is sound for well-justified configurations, but not for justified configurations. For example, well-justified configurations are type-safe.Well-justification allows many, but not all reorderings performed by relaxed memory.

This approach involves a graph associated with an algebra A or a relational structure A, whose vertices are the elements of A (or A), the edges represent subsets of A such that the restriction of some term operation of A is `good' on the subset, that is, act as an operation of one of the 3 types: semilattice, majority, or affine. In this paper we significantly refine and advance this approach. In particular, we prove certain connectivity and rectangularity properties of relations over algebras related to components of the graph connected by semilattice and affine edges. We also prove a result similar to 2-decomposition of relations invariant under a majority operation, only here we do not impose any restrictions on the relation. These results allow us to give a new, somewhat more intuitive proof of the bounded width theorem: the CSP over algebra A has bounded width if and only if A does not contain affine edges. Actually, this result shows that bounded width implies width (2,3). We also consider algebras with edges from a restricted set of types. In particular, it can be proved that type restrictions are preserved under the standard algebraic constructions. Finally, we prove that algebras without semilattice edges have few subalgebras of powers, that is, the CSP over such algebras is also polynomial time.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576404","","Algebra;Complexity theory;Standards;Computer science;Games;Optimization","algebra;computational complexity;constraint satisfaction problems;constraint theory;graph theory;set theory","algebra;type restrictions;standard algebraic constructions;semilattice edges;CSP;relational structure;restricted types;LICS 2004 paper;local structure;finite algebras;term operation;connectivity;majority operation;constraint satisfaction problem","","","","38","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We come back to this central problem, considering it from a proof search viewpoint, and provide some new completeness arguments in the linear time μ-calculus. Our results only deal with restricted classes of formulas that closely correspond to (non-alternating) ω-automata but, compared to earlier proofs, our completeness arguments are direct and constructive. We first consider a natural circular proof system based on sequent calculus, and show that it is complete for inclusions of parity automata expressed as formulas, making use of Safra's construction directly in proof search. We then consider the corresponding finitary proof system, featuring (co)induction rules, and provide a partial translation result from circular to finitary proofs.

Recently, cost register automata (CRA) have been introduced as an alternative model to describe any function realised by a WA by means of a deterministic machine. Unambiguous WA over a monoid $(M,\otimes )$ can equivalently be described by cost register automata whose registers take their values in M, and are updated by operations of the form $x :=y\otimes c$, with $c\in M$. This class is denoted by $\mathrm {CRA}_{\otimes c}(M)$.We introduce a twinning property and a bounded variation property parametrised by an integer k, such that the corresponding notions introduced originally by Choffrut for finite-state transducers are obtained for k=1. Given an unambiguous weighted automaton W over an infinitary group $(G,\otimes )$ realizing some function f, we prove that the three following properties are equivalent: i) W satisfies the twinning property of order k, ii) f satisfies the k-bounded variation property, and iii) f can be described by a $\mathrm {CRA}_{\otimes c}(G)$ with at most k registers.In the spirit of tranducers, we actually prove this result in a more general setting by considering machines over the semiring of finite sets of elements from $(G,\otimes )$ : the three properties are still equivalent for such finite-valued weighted automata, that is the ones associating with words subsets of G of cardinality at most $\ell$, for some natural $\ell$. Moreover, we show that if the operation $\otimes \, \mathrm {of}\, G$ is commutative and computable, then one can decide whether a WA satisfies the twinning property of order k. As a corollary, this allows to decide the register minimisation problem for the class $\mathrm {CRA}_{\otimes c}(G)$.Last, we prove that a similar result holds for finite-valued finite-state transducers, and that the register minimisation problem for the class CRAc(B*) is PSPACE-complete.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576399","weighted automata;cost register automata;minimisation;twinning property","Automata;Registers;Transducers;Minimization;Computational modeling;Additives;Complexity theory","computational complexity;computational linguistics;decidability;deterministic automata;finite state machines;group theory;minimisation","generalised twinning property;weighted automata;finite-state automata;k-bounded variation property;k registers;register minimisation problem;finite-valued finite-state transducers;cost register automata minimisation;unambiguous weighted automaton","","","","14","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, it has attracted significant attention from the verification community, resulting in several successful tools for formally proving differential privacy. Although their technical approaches vary greatly, all existing tools rely on reasoning principles derived from the composition theorem of differential privacy. While this suffices to verify most common private algorithms, there are several important algorithms whose privacy analysis does not rely solely on the composition theorem. Their proofs are significantly more complex, and are currently beyond the reach of verification tools.In this paper, we develop compositional methods for formally verifying differential privacy for algorithms whose analysis goes beyond the composition theorem. Our methods are based on deep connections between differential privacy and probabilistic couplings, an established mathematical tool for reasoning about stochastic processes. Even when the composition theorem is not helpful, we can often prove privacy by a coupling argument.We demonstrate our methods on two algorithms: the Exponential mechanism and the Above Threshold algorithm, the critical component of the famous Sparse Vector algorithm. We verify these examples in a relational program logic apRHL+, which can construct approximate couplings. This logic extends the existing apRHL logic with more general rules for the Laplace mechanism and the one-sided Laplace mechanism, and new structural rules enabling pointwise reasoning about privacy; all the rules are inspired by the connection with coupling. While our paper is presented from a formal verification perspective, we believe that its main insight is of independent interest for the differential privacy community.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576449","","Probabilistic logic;Privacy;Tools;Couplings;Approximation algorithms;Cognition","data privacy;formal verification;probability;stochastic processes","probabilistic couplings;composition theorem;privacy analysis;differential privacy community;verification tools;formal verification;exponential mechanism;stochastic processes;above threshold algorithm;sparse vector algorithm;relational program logic","","","","32","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We identify a criterion on equational theories and classes of comodels that guarantees completeness, over the given class of comodels, of the standard equational calculus, and show that this criterion is satisfied in our leading examples. Based on a complete equational axiomatization of the memory (co)model, we then give a complete inductive-coinductive calculus for simulation between states, where a state simulates another if it has at least the same terminating computations, with the same cumulative effect on global state. Extensional equivalence of computations can then be expressed as mutual simulation.

We study polynomial-time problems in two classical models, graphs and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with respect to several fundamental ω-regular objectives, e.g., Rabin and Streett objectives. For many of these problems the best-known upper bounds are quadratic or cubic, yet no super-linear lower bounds are known. In this work our contributions are two-fold: First, we present several improved algorithms, and second, we present the first conditional super-linear lower bounds based on widely believed assumptions about the complexity of CNF-SAT and combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication. A separation result for two models with respect to an objective means a conditional lower bound for one model that is strictly higher than the existing upper bound for the other model, and similarly for two objectives with respect to a model. Our results establish the following separation results: (1) A separation of models (graphs and MDPs) for disjunctive queries of reachability and Büchi objectives. (2) Two kinds of separations of objectives, both for graphs and MDPs, namely, (2a) the separation of dual objectives such as Streett/Rabin objectives, and (2b) the separation of conjunction and disjunction of multiple objectives of the same type such as safety, Büchi, and coBüchi. In summary, our results establish the first model and objective separation results for graphs and MDPs for various classical ω-regular objectives. Quite strikingly, we establish conditional lower bounds for the disjunction of objectives that are strictly higher than the existing upper bounds for the conjunction of the same objectives.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576441","","Upper bound;Standards;Computational modeling;Markov processes;Safety;Probabilistic logic;Heuristic algorithms","Boolean algebra;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;Markov processes;matrix multiplication;reachability analysis","ω-regular objectives;Rabin objectives;objective separation;reachability queries;Streett objectives;Markov Decision Processes;polynomial-time problems;model-checking question;conditional lower bounds;Büchi objectives;graphs;combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication","","","","40","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The condition enables greater flexibility in object design by allowing more behaviours to be admitted, which in turn allows the algorithms implementing quiescent consistent objects to be more efficient (when executed in a multithreaded environment).Quiescent consistency of an implementation object is defined in terms of a corresponding abstract specification. This gives rise to two important verification questions: membership (checking whether a behaviour of the implementation is allowed by the specification) and correctness (checking whether all behaviours of the implementation are allowed by the specification). In this paper, we consider the membership and correctness conditions for quiescent consistency, as well as a restricted form that assumes an upper limit on the number of events between two quiescent states. We show that the membership problem for unrestricted quiescent consistency is NP-complete and that the correctness problem is decidable, coNEXPTIME-hard, and in EXPSPACE.

Focusing on the call-by-name translation, we adapt it to the dependent case and prove that it is compatible with the definitional equality of our system, thus avoiding coherence problems. This allows us to use any category as forcing conditions, which is out of reach with the call-by-value translation. Our construction also exploits the notion of storage operators in order to interpret dependent elimination for inductive types. This is a novel example of a dependent theory with side-effects, clarifying how dependent elimination for inductive types must be restricted in a non-pure setting.

The second one is by Niwinski who showed that one can compute the cardinality of any ω-regular language of infinite trees.Here, we generalise the model of automata of Tison and Bogaert to the setting of infinite binary trees. Roughly speaking we consider parity tree automata where some transitions are guarded and can be used only when the two direct sub-trees of the current node are equal/disequal. We show that the resulting class of languages encompasses the one of ω-regular languages of infinite trees while sharing most of its closure properties, in particular it is a Boolean algebra.

In the logic setting this translates to the statement that if two graphs of size n can be distinguished by a formula in first order logic with counting with 3 variables (i.e., in C3) then they can also be distinguished by a C3-formula that has quantifier depth at most O (n2/log(n)).To prove the result we define a game between two players that enables us to decouple the causal dependencies between the processes happening simultaneously over several iterations of the algorithm. This allows us to treat large color classes and small color classes separately. As part of our proof we show that for graphs with bounded color class size, the number of iterations until stabilization is at most linear in the number of vertices.

Previous work has shown how guarded recursion is useful for reasoning operationally about programming languages with advanced features including general references, recursive types, countable non-determinism and concurrency.Guarded recursion also offers a way of adding recursion to type theory while maintaining logical consistency. In previous work we initiated a programme of denotational semantics in type theory using guarded recursion, by constructing a computationally adequate model of the language PCF (simply typed lambda calculus with fixed points). This model was intensional in that it could distinguish between computations computing the same result using a different number of fixed point unfoldings.In this work we show how also programming languages with recursive types can be given denotational semantics in type theory with guarded recursion. More precisely, we give a computationally adequate denotational semantics to the language FPC (simply typed lambda calculus extended with recursive types), modelling recursive types using guarded recursive types. The model is inten-sional in the same way as was the case in previous work, but we show how to recover extensionality using a logical relation.All constructions and reasoning in this paper, including proofs of theorems such as soundness and adequacy, are by (informal) reasoning in type theory, often using guarded recursion.Categories and Subject Descriptors F.3.2 [Semantics of Programming Languages]: Denotational semantics; F.4.1 [Mathematical Logic and Formal Languages]: Lambda calculus and related systems.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576387","Denotational Semantics;Recursive Types;Type Theory;Guarded Recursion;Synthetic Domain Theory","Computational modeling;Semantics;Mathematical model;Calculus;Cognition;Syntactics;Computer languages","formal languages;formal logic;lambda calculus;programming language semantics;theorem proving;type theory","denotational semantics;recursive types;synthetic guarded domain theory;guarded recursion;recursive calls;programming languages;type theory;proofs of theorems","","","","23","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the new extended Frege system from [10], denoted EE + Vred, which is a natural extension of classical extended Frege EE. Our main results are the following: Firstly, we prove that the standard Gentzen-style system G*1 p-simulates EE + Vred and that G*1 is strictly stronger under standard complexity-theoretic hardness assumptions. Secondly, we show a correspondence of EE + Vred to bounded arithmetic: EE + Vred can be seen as the non-uniform propositional version of intuitionistic S12 . Specifically, intuitionistic S12 proofs of arbitrary statements in prenex form translate to polynomial-size EE + Vred proofs, and EE + Vred is in a sense the weakest system with this property.

Among them, one of the most fundamental is the definability of a rational language in the class of aperiodic languages, i.e., languages recognized by finite automata whose transition relation defines an aperiodic congruence. An important corollary of this result is the first-order definability of monadic second-order formulas over finite words. Our goal is to extend these results to rational transductions, i.e. word functions realized by finite transducers. We take an algebraic approach and consider definability problems of rational transductions in a given variety of congruences (or monoids). The strength of the algebraic theory of rational languages relies on the existence of a congruence canonically attached to every language, the syntactic congruence. In a similar spirit, Reutenauer and Schützenberger have defined a canonical device for rational transductions, that we extend to establish our main contribution: an effective characterization of V-transductions, i.e. rational transductions realizable by transducers whose transition relation defines a congruence in a (decidable) variety V. In particular, it provides an algorithm to decide the definability of a rational transduction by an aperiodic finite transducer. Using those results, we show that the FO-definability of a rational transduction is decidable, where FO-definable means definable in a first-order restriction of logical transducers á la Courcelle.","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576413","rational word transductions;definability problems;first-order logic;algebraic characterizations","Transducers;Automata;Syntactics;Formal languages;Indexes;Tools;Minimization","algebra;computational linguistics;decidability;finite automata;formal languages;group theory","algebraic approach;algebraic theory;first-order definability;rational languages;rational transductions;decidability;syntactic congruence;V-transductions;finite automata","","","","29","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This logical strength comes at the price of a complicated computational interpretation which involves strong recursion schemes like bar recursion. We take the best from both worlds and define a realizability model for arithmetic and the axiom of choice which encompasses both intuitionistic and classical reasoning. In this model two versions of the axiom of choice can co-exist in a single proof: intuitionistic choice and classical countable choice. We interpret intuitionistic choice efficiently, however its premise cannot come from classical reasoning. Conversely, our version of classical choice is valid in full classical logic, but it is restricted to the countable case and its realizer involves bar recursion.

The reduction relations for well-known types arise from that. To further support the introduction of this new type theory, we also prove fundamental properties of its term calculus. Most importantly, we prove subject reduction and strong normalisation of the reduction relation, which gives computational meaning to the terms. The presented type theory is based on ideas from categorical logic that have been investigated before by the first author, and it extends Hagino's categorical data types to a dependently typed setting.

However, if the assumed interpretation is not given, then the situation is markedly harder.In this paper we give a structural characterization of graph classes which are FO interpretable in graph classes of bounded degree. This characterization allows us to efficiently compute such an interpretation for an input graph. As a consequence, we obtain an FPT algorithm for FO model checking of graph classes FO interpretable in graph classes of bounded degree.

"Perfect-Information Stochastic Games with Generalized Mean-Payoff Objectives","K. Chatterjee; L.

In the synthesis of stochastic reactive processes, the traditional model is perfect-information stochastic games, where some transitions of the game graph are controlled by two adversarial players, and the other transitions are executed probabilistically. We consider such games where the objective is the conjunction of several quantitative objectives (specified as mean-payoff conditions), which we refer to as generalized mean-payoff objectives. The basic decision problem asks for the existence of a finite-memory strategy for a player that ensures the generalized mean-payoff objective be satisfied with a desired probability against all strategies of the opponent. A special case of the decision problem is the almost-sure problem where the desired probability is 1. Previous results presented a semi-decision procedure for ε-approximations of the almost-sure problem. In this work, we show that both the almost-sure problem as well as the general basic decision problem are coNP-complete, significantly improving the previous results. Moreover, we show that in the case of 1-player stochastic games, randomized memoryless strategies are sufficient and the problem can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast, in two-player stochastic games, we show that even with randomized strategies exponential memory is required in general, and present a matching exponential upper bound. We also study the basic decision problem with infinite-memory strategies and present computational complexity results for the problem. Our results are relevant in the synthesis of stochastic reactive systems with multiple quantitative requirements.Categories and Subject Descriptors F.2.2 [Computations on Discrete Structures]","2575-5528","978-1-4503-4391-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576452","Verification;Algorithms;Stochastic games;Markov decision processes;Mean-payoff.","Games;Stochastic processes;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Semantics;Probability distribution;Upper bound","computational complexity;graph theory;optimisation;probability;stochastic games","perfect-information stochastic games;generalized mean-payoff objective;graph games;stochastic reactive processes;game graph;stochastic reactive systems;probability;coNP-complete","","","","47","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A propositional system with six binary connectives is defined and given a phase space interpretation. Choosing classical, intuitionistic or affine reasoning is entirely dependent on the subformula property. Moreover, the connectives of these logics can mix without restriction. We give a sound and complete sequent calculus that requires novel proof transformations for cut elimination. Compared to linear logic, classical fragments of proofs are better isolated from non-classical fragments. One of our goals is to allow non-classical restrictions to coexist with computational interpretations of classical logic such as found in the λμ calculus. In fact, we show that the transition between different modes of proof, classical, intuitionistic and affine, can be interpreted by delimited control operators.

In this work we present a novel process for the fabrication of nanoscale SQUIDs, based on superconducting vertical Nb nanoconstrictions. The fabrication process uses laser lithography to define the device geometry, focused ion beam to mill the top surface of the Nb in a nanometer-sized region across the width of the film and anodization to define the final thickness of the nanoconstriction and at the same time to embed the ion-implanted amorphous layer produced by the FIB milling step.

The principle of MWA is based on inducing the water molecule of the tissue to flip about 5 billions of time per second, depending on the frequency of the microwave. The interaction among the molecules is responsible of the increment of tissue temperature, thus of cellular death. A fresh porcine liver was treated by means of a 2.45 GHz antenna (100 W, 4 min). Tissue temperature was measured during the whole procedures by fiber optic-based probes located at eight fixed distances from the antenna. A three-dimensional temperature map was obtained by simulating the interaction between MW and liver; such map was then experimentally validated. Both theoretical and experimental temperature distribution around the antenna can be modelled by a Gaussian trend. There is a good agreement between experimental and theoretical temperature distributions. The validated model provides lethal isotherms, hence allowing extracting the volume of coagulated tissue. Simulations showed that shape of the coagulated tissue is an ellipse with long and short axes of 4.5 cm and 2.3 cm, respectively. Finally, it was verified that the Gaussian trend obtained by simulated data fit well experimental temperatures; this was also confirmed by the high value of the correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.97), and by the low value of the root mean squared error (RMSE ≈2.9 °C). Distributed temperature measurements allow validation of a Gaussian model, which accurately predicts the three-dimensional temperature distribution around a 2.45GHz MW antenna.","","978-1-5090-4406-1","10.1109/NANOFIM.2016.8521428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8521428","Molecular interaction;Cancer ablation;Microwave ablation;fiber optic sensors;Nanoscale energy deposition","Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Antennas;Antenna measurements;Liver;Temperature sensors;Bragg gratings","biological tissues;biothermics;coagulation;fibre optic sensors;hyperthermia;liver;probes;temperature distribution;temperature measurement","MW antenna;three-dimensional temperature distribution;distributed temperature measurements;experimental temperatures;coagulated tissue;validated model;theoretical temperature distributions;experimental temperature distributions;Gaussian trend;experimental temperature distribution;theoretical temperature distribution;fiber optic-based probes;fresh porcine liver;tissue temperature;water molecule;microwave ablation system;three-dimensional temperature map;experimental validation;theoretical prediction;ex vivo porcine liver;temperature 2.9 degC;frequency 2.45 GHz;power 100.0 W;size 2.3 cm;time 4.0 min;bandwidth 2.45 GHz","","","","31","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity of uncoated and PEG-coated HNTs was evaluated in vitro by MTT cell viability assay carried out on two different human cell lines: SKOV-3 (human ovarian carcinoma cells) and MG-63 (human osteosarcoma cells). Cells were each time incubated for 6 to 72 h in the presence of HNTs at a concentration ranging from 0.25 to 1.5 mg/mL before the MTT test was performed. Obtained results showed that, for both the considered cell lines., viability was substantially unaffected for any tested combination of incubation time and PEG-coated HNT concentration. On the other hand., when the cells were incubated with uncoated HNTs significant reductions in viability (indicative of cytotoxic effects) were visible after a 48-h incubation for each adopted nanoparticle dose. On these bases., PEG coating can be considered a highly effective method to improve the biocompatibility of HNTs., which in turn has a very strong potential for an effective employment as ultrasound contrast and drug delivery agent.","","978-1-5090-4406-1","10.1109/NANOFIM.2016.8521430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8521430","halloysite nanotubes;cytocompatibility;biomedical materials;nanobiotechnology","Nanotubes;Coatings;Surface treatment;Ultrasonic imaging;Extraterrestrial measurements;Nanobioscience;Atmospheric measurements","biomedical materials;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;cellular biophysics;clay;coatings;drug delivery systems;drugs;nanocomposites;nanofabrication;nanomedicine;nanoparticles;nanotubes;toxicology;tumours","halloysite clay nanotubes;surface coating;poly(ethylene glycol);concentration level suitable;ultrasound contrast agents;contrast dose;automatic HNT detection;echographic images;clinically-available ultrasound device;conventional diagnostic settings;time-dependent cytotoxicity;PEG-coated HNTs;MTT cell viability assay;human ovarian carcinoma cells;MG-63;human osteosarcoma cells;MTT test;considered cell lines;incubation time;PEG-coated HNT concentration;uncoated HNTs significant reductions;cytotoxic effects;adopted nanoparticle dose;in vitro cytotoxicity;human cell lines;incubation;drug delivery agent;highly effective method;PEG coating;time 6.0 hour to 72.0 hour","","1","","20","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though it is needed to find optimal sonication parameters relating to time and energy, at which CNT bundles get detached but single CNTs not get broken or shortened. For some applications of CNT nanocomposite based sensors it is needed to manufacture composites based on organic solvents without surfactants or water, e.g. when surfactants or the hygroscopicity alter the sensor behaviour. In this study I-MethyI-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) is used as solvent to disperse multi walled CNTs without the help of surfactants. Moreover the optimum sonication time and energy are determined via the absorbance of dispersions in UV-VIS-spectroscopy.

Under MW radiation, a water molecule flips back and forth 2:109-5:109 times a second depending on the frequency of the microwave. This biomolecular interaction induces a tissue temperature increment and cellular death via coagulation necrosis. The thermal sensitivity was investigated at two CT scan settings. Four fresh pig kidneys were treated using two antennae at 65W and for 4 minutes, and they were scanned before the treatment and 24 times during the MWA (each 10 s). During the heating the temperature trend was measured in two points by two thermocouples located at different distances from the antennae, from 10mm to 30mm. The relationship between the CT number and the increase of tissue temperature was obtained by using a linear regression analysis. Lastly, the thermal sensitivity of the technique, showing the change of the CT number for unit of temperature increase, was estimated as the slope of the best fitting line. The CT number shows an inverse linear relationship with tissue temperature with a thermal sensitivity of about -0.34 HU.°C-1. This result agree with data reported in literature on other organs. The scan settings have a negligible influence on thermal sensitivity; on the other hand at higher kVp and mAs the performances are better in terms of measurement dispersion. Our promising results foster further investigation around this technique, which is particularly attractive because with a non-invasive approach may provide a three-dimensional temperature distribution within the organ.","","978-1-5090-4406-1","10.1109/NANOFIM.2016.8521424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8521424","Molecular interaction;Cancer ablation;Computed Tomography;Microwave ablation;Nanoscale energy deposition","Temperature measurement;Computed tomography;Temperature sensors;Sensitivity;Kidney;Electromagnetic heating;Microwave imaging","biological tissues;biothermics;coagulation;computerised tomography;hyperthermia;kidney;medical image processing;microwave heating;regression analysis;temperature distribution;temperature measurement;thermocouples","temperature trend;CT number;linear regression analysis;thermal sensitivity;temperature increase;feasibility assessment;CT-thermometry;ex vivo porcine kidneys;MWA;tissue temperature increment;CT scan settings;fresh pig kidneys;microwave ablation;computed tomography images;three-dimensional temperature distribution;time 4.0 min;time 10.0 s;power 65.0 W;size 10.0 mm to 30.0 mm;frequency 2.45 GHz","","1","","25","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this aim, polyimide substrate was exposed to oxygen plasma treatment in order to activate and enhance the surfaces prior deposition of the MWCNTs/epoxy nanocomposite thin film. In fact, exposure time was varied 2, 4, 5, 10 min in order to investigate the impact on the electro-mechanical response. For deeply investigation, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to examine the topography of the modified surfaces of the kapton HN by measuring the root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness. The AFM results show that the root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of pristine PI film was 2.5 nm, increasing to 15.5 nm after 4 minutes oxygen plasma treatment. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy was used to follow the changes on the molecular structure of surface following treatment time.

Systems with intrinsic spin property provide platforms of spin control. One prominent example is the topological insulator (TI) which has a nontrivial topological Z2 invariant inherited in the bulk system. Due to the bulk-edge correspondence, the TI with boundary surface has surface states whose spin has preferred direction that exhibits the great advantage to be utilized in the spintronics devices. It was experimentally confirmed that the famous three-dimensional TI Bi2Se3 stacking in the (111) z direction has surface states whose spin is locked perpendicular to the momentum direction. However, this does not fully utilize the potential to manipulate the spin in TI. Actually, the bulk-edge correspondence allows different spin textures in surface states localized in different boundary surfaces. Using the ab initio calculation, we demonstrated that the spin indeed has only one allowed direction (either parallel or antiparallel) near the Γ point in Bi2Se3 cut in surface perpendicular to (111) direction, different from the observed spin circulation around the Γ point in (111) cut Bi2Se3. The different spin texture in different surface orientation was theoretically demonstrated in the first-order continuum model [1] and was confirmed in our full ab initio calculation. Constructing the tight binding model from finite differencing the continuum model up to third order, we also confirmed the changes in spin textures in different cut surfaces from the same bulk Hamiltonian. The localization of these surface states was also confirmed. The different spin textures resulting from different surfaces can be utilized in spin manipulation and controls in devices.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479846","","Surface texture;Surface states;Topological insulators;Spintronics;Physics;Electronic mail;Magnetic devices","ab initio calculations;bismuth compounds;finite difference methods;magnetoelectronics;surface states;texture;tight-binding calculations;topological insulators","spin circulation;surface orientation;magnetic devices;spintronics devices;spin utilization;three-dimensional TI stacking;z direction;momentum direction;ab initio calculation;first-order continuum model;tight binding model;bulk Hamiltonian;spin manipulation;surface states;boundary surface;bulk-edge correspondence;bulk system;nontrivial topological Z2 invariant;spin control;intrinsic spin property;topological insulator;spin texture changes;Bi2Se3","","","","1","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our design, a single axis TMR sensor is the target object which converts the position information into the output voltage with an in-phase and quadrature synchronous detector, as show in Fig. 1(a). The sensing direction of the TMR sensor was set perpendicular to the plane of two gradient coils.

It has been known that the skyrmions can form at the room temperature through the chiral interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), induced by the inversion-symmetry broken at the interface between ferromagnetic and heavy-metal layers [3], [4]. In this presentation, we report micromagnetic simulation results on the strong inertial effects of skyrmions driven by the time-varying spin-Hall effects.

The research results show that the winding diameter has a huge effect on the winding AC loss in ironless BLDCM, and the shunt wound structure with multiple wires method can reduce winding AC loss effectively. However, due to induced voltage and impedance unbalance, additional circulating current loss would be induced. For circulating current losses calculation, a winding circulating current equivalent calculation model is built. The circulating current losses are calculated by simplified 3D finite element method and the winding strand arrangement method to reduce circulating current loss is explored.

Nevertheless, the effect of interfacial AFM moments on the induced PMA of adjacent FM layer is not fully clear.Here, we report an experimental investigation onthe effects of interfacial coupling of the AFM films on the induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in epitaxially grown Mn/2 ML Co/14 ML Ni films. Magnetic hysteresis loops show that the PMA is established when monolayer Mn film was deposited. Further increasing the Mn layer thickness (tMn) leads to presence of in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The PMA is established again while tMn is large than 6 ML (Fig 1(a)). Meanwhile, the structure of Mn is changed from c-fct to e-fct. Moreover, we also vary the interface properties by using Mn-based alloy AFM films. A significant change on the behavior of induced PMA is observed.According to these results, we indicate that antiferromagnet-induced PMA is highly sensitive to the interfacial moments of the AFM films and the magnetic interaction of such moments with the volume moment.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479686","","Films;Manganese;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic hysteresis;Education;Frequency modulation;Magnetization","antiferromagnetic materials;cobalt alloys;coercive force;exchange interactions (electron);interface magnetism;magnetic anisotropy;magnetic epitaxial layers;magnetic hysteresis;magnetic moments;magnetic multilayers;magnetic switching;manganese alloys;monolayers;nickel alloys;perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","antiferromagnetic layers;interfacial exchange interaction effect;adjacent ferromagnetic layers;magnetic interaction;interfacial moments;in-plane magnetic anisotropy;monolayer Mn film;magnetic hysteresis loops;AFM films;interfacial coupling;adjacent FM layer;interfacial AFM moments;AFM/FM interface;AFM layer;uncompensated moment;magnetization reorientation;magnetization switching;exchange bias;coercivity enhancement;antiferromagnet-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;MnCoNi","","","","1","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Actually, the Tesla's AC Induction Motor is dubbed one of the ten greatest discoveries of all time. This popularity has been extended to the latest Tesla Motors which has set a new world speed record for production electric vehicles (EVs). Meanwhile, the permanent-magnet (PM) brushless machines are superseding the induction machine because of their high efficiency and high power density. In order to fulfill the ever increasing demand on electric propulsion, innovation of electric machines accelerates. For instance, the stator-PM machines combine the merits of both PM brushless and switched-reluctance machines to offer energy-efficient robust operation; the vernier PM in-wheel machines incorporate the vernier effect into the PM brushless machines to provide low-speed high-torque direct-drive operation; and the advanced magnetless machines adopt innovative topologies to compensate the reduction of torque and power densities due to the absence of PM material. Increasingly, the development of electric machines has been expanded to incorporate the heat engine for hybrid propulsion. Rather than using the planetary-geared machine system to perform power split for electronic continuously variable transmission (ECVT), the double-rotor machine system is developed to achieve gearless ECVT, and the magnetic-geared machine system is proposed to achieve ECVT without physical gearing or brushes. In this paper, various electric machines and machine systems for electric and hybrid vehicles will be discussed, with emphasis on the challenges and opportunities of those emerging machine topologies.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479941","Topics;EM2-Electric Machines Applications","Stator windings;Torque;Magnetic flux;Density measurement;Power system measurements;Propulsion","brushless machines;electric propulsion;finite element analysis;gears;hybrid electric vehicles;machine windings;permanent magnet machines;power transmission (mechanical);reluctance machines;rotors;stators;torque","electric vehicle machines;rotating magnetic field theory;Nikola Tesla;induction machine;world speed record;permanent-magnet brushless machines;high efficiency;high power density;electric propulsion;stator-PM machines;switched-reluctance machines;energy-efficient robust operation;vernier PM in-wheel machines;PM brushless machines;advanced magnetless machines;planetary-geared machine system;double-rotor machine system;magnetic-geared machine system;hybrid vehicles;emerging machine topologies;AC induction motor;Tesla Motors;electric vehicles production","","7","","13","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past, research has mostly been carried out with multiferroic materials and magnetic semiconductors. Recently, more effort was focused on 3d transition ferromagnetic metals. Especially in heavy metal/ferromagnet/oxide (HM/FM/oxide) structures where the magnetic anisotropy has an interfacial origin, electric fields can cause a marked change on the magnetic anisotropy energy. This voltage-controlled anisotropy (VCA) can be understood by the electric field induced charge transfer among different d orbitals of the FM. The order of this effect is around 100 fJ/Vm and it vanishes with the removing of the electric fields.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479852","","Electric fields;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Saturation magnetization;Frequency modulation;Voltage control;Three-dimensional displays","ferromagnetic materials;ferromagnetism;magnetic anisotropy;magnetic switching;magnetoelectronics","electric field;magnetic anisotropy energy;voltage-controlled anisotropy;voltage-controlled magnetization switching;solid-state systems;magnetic semiconductors;heavy metal-ferromagnet-oxide structures;HM-FM-oxide structures;ultralow energy spintronic devices;3D transition ferromagnetic metals;multiferroic materials;VCA;FM d orbitals","","","","2","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

[1]-[3] In order to facilitate these coupling, the use of ferromagnetic (FM) bottom electrode to induce specific texture of BFO seems to be a most direct way. In this study, BFO films are grown on FM CoPt(111) underlayer on glass substrate by sputtering. In addition to serving as a FM bottom electrode, CoPt(111) is also expected to reduce the formation temperature of BFO phase [3]-[4]. A CoPt layer with optimized (111)-texture was used to grow high-quality BFO film. Structure, ferroelectric, and magnetic properties of BiFeO3 (110) films grown on 10-50-nm-thick ferromagnetic CoPt(111) buffered glass substrate at 350-550°C have been studied. (110)-texture of BFO films is developed at the reduced temperature as low as 400-550°C, but isotropic orientation is found at higher temperature of 600 °C. Low temperature deposition results in dense microstructure, fine grains, and smooth surface morphology, which are favorable for applications. BFO(110) films on CoPt(111) underlayer exhibit desired ferroelectric and magnetic properties. Electrical polarization (2Pr) of 96-137 μC/cm2 and coercive field (Ec) of 495-618 kV/cm for studied BFO (110) films are comparable to those grown on single crystal substrates. Moreover, exchange bias between BFO and CoPt is observed after a field cooling from 370 °C to room temperature (RT) at 2 kOe. Large exchange bias field of 155 Oe at RT and coercivity of 1631 Oe are obtained. The presented results provide useful information for the applications based on electric-magnetic interactions.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479879","","Films;Temperature;Substrates;Electrodes;Glass;Frequency modulation;Couplings","bismuth compounds;cobalt alloys;coercive force;crystal microstructure;dielectric polarisation;exchange interactions (electron);ferroelectric coercive field;ferroelectric thin films;ferromagnetic materials;magnetic thin films;multiferroics;platinum alloys;sputter deposition;surface morphology;surface texture","multiferroic properties;reduced temperature;ferroelectric orderings;magnetic orderings;room temperature;advanced spintronic memory devices;electric-magnetic couplings;FM bottom electrode;formation temperature;BFO phase;high-quality BFO film;magnetic properties;higher temperature;electric-magnetic interactions;ferromagnetic bottom electrode;cobalt platinum (111) electrode layer;glass substrates;perovskite structure;specific texture;sputtering;ferroelectric properties;low temperature deposition;microstructure;smooth surface morphology;electrical polarization;coercive field;single crystal substrates;field cooling;exchange bias field;coercivity;FM cobalt platinum (111) underlayer;thick ferromagnetic cobalt platinum (111) buffered glass substrate;temperature 600.0 degC;temperature 293 K to 298 K;size 10 nm to 50 nm;temperature 350 degC to 550 degC;BiFeO3-CoPt","","","","4","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, like the single-phase BLDC and SRM, the single-phase DCFSM suffers from low or null starting torque at some rotor positions which limits the applications of the single-phase DCFSM. In this paper, a single-phase 8-slot, 4-pole DCFSM is designed and a novel rotor structure which uses reluctance torque produced by field current is proposed to improve starting torque. The performance of the proposed single-phase DCFSM is analyzed with FEA software and the results are presented.

The Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogneides (2D TMDs) materials, a few layerd Vanadium disulfide (VS2), has been synthesized experimentally. It's intrinsic magnetism and potential applications as a high-performance functional nanomaterial attracted particular interest. The electronic structure calculations of monolayer VS2 were performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) which implemented in VASP code. The energy cutoff for plane-wave basis expansion was set to 400 eV. The total energies were calculated with the convergence criteria 1×10-5 eV per unit cell. The magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE) is estimated from the total energy difference between the different magnetization directions: MAE = E[100]-E[001]. In the present work we used the 16×16×1 mesh in k-point sampling. Fig. 1 is a monolayer VS2. Each V atom is surrounded by six neighboring S atoms, while each S atom has three neighboring V atoms, which structure is as same as MoS2 monolayer. The calculated lattice constant of monolayer VS2 is 3.17 A. The MAE value of VSe2 is 0.21 meV/f.u.and easy plane is parallel to surface. When applied a small perpendicular electric field about 0.03 meV/A, the MAE value changes it sign and easy plane is perpendiculat to surface which is -0.78 meV/f.u. This value is large than the MAE of 4.8×10-3 meV/f.u. Fe in the bulk system. The electric field effects on the magnetic anisotropy in VS2 are presented in Fig. 2. When applied a small perpendicular electric field make a great changes of the MAE. There are very rare materials can be reversed the magnetic orientation when applied a small electric field. We hope that this studied material has a great potential in spintronics applications.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479781","","Electric fields;Atomic layer deposition;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic tunneling;Roads;Magnetization","ab initio calculations;APW calculations;band structure;lattice constants;magnetic anisotropy;magnetic switching;magnetoelectric effects;monolayers;total energy;vanadium compounds","electric field assisted magnetization switching;intrinsic magnetism;magnetic anisotropy energy;magnetic orientation;perpendicular electric field;lattice constant;k-point sampling;total energies;plane-wave basis expansion;VASP code;GGA;PBE;Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation;PAW;projector augmented wave method;monolayer;electronic structure;first-principles study;vanadium disulfide;two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides;low-power spintronic devices;VS2","","","","3","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, Fe-Ga alloy single crystals were successfully grown by the Czochralski (CZ) method [1]. In this study, the relationship between the magnetostrictive property and magnetic domain structure in an Fe-16 at%Ga alloy single crystal grown by the CZ method was investigated. To evaluate the magnetostrictive property, a strain gauge was attached on the (001) plane in the [100] direction. The magnetic domain structure on the (001) plane was observed by a magneto-optic Kerr effect microscope. In the mentioned-above experiments, magnetic fields were applied in the [100] direction on the plane. Figure 1 shows the magnetostriction curve of the specimen. The magnetostriction rapidly increases in the vicinity of 1250 Oe with increasing magnetic field and reaches the saturation value of about 109 ppm at about 2000 Oe. As shown in Fig. 2, 90° domain walls are aligned with the <;110> direction at zero magnetic field. Additionally, 180° domain walls form a staircase-like structure. When a magnetic field was applied along the [100] direction, 180° domain walls primarily moved, and they almost disappeared at about 1100 Oe. In other words, a striped domain structure composed of 90° domain walls was observed. The single domain structure was obtained after motion of 90° domain walls under the magnetic field above about 2000 Oe. Therefore, the mentioned-above change of magnetic domain structure corresponds to the magnetostrictive property. It is clear that 180° domain walls easily moved compared to 90° domain walls by applying the magnetic field in the Fe-16 at%Ga alloy single crystal.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8480009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8480009","","Magnetic domains;Magnetostriction;Magnetic fields;Metals;Crystals;Magnetic domain walls;Saturation magnetization","coercive force;crystal growth from melt;energy harvesting;gallium alloys;iron alloys;Kerr magneto-optical effect;magnetic domain walls;magnetic hysteresis;magnetic structure;magnetostriction","magnetostrictive property;CZ method;magnetic domain structure;machinability;actuators;vibration energy harvesters;iron-gallium alloy single crystal growth;strain gauge;magneto-optic Kerr effect microscopy;staircase-like structure;domain walls;single domain structure;striped domain structure;zero magnetic field;magnetostriction curve;Czochralski method;FeGa","","","","1","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, the preparation of Pr-Fe-B thick films on glass substrates without a buffer layer was carried out. This contribution reports the evaluation on the magnetic and mechanical properties in each film with different Pr contents. Each film was deposited on a glass substrate by using a YAG pulse laser ( λ: 355 nm, frequency: 30 Hz) in the vacuum atmosphere of 2×10-5 Pa. The laser beam was focused on the surface of a PrXFe14B(X=1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4) target under the deposition rate higher than 10μm/h. A pulse annealing (PA) method enabled us to crystallize hard magnetic phase. Figure 1 shows the magnetic properties as a function of Pr contents in each film thicker than 10μm. As the amount of Pr increased, coercivity increased and residual magnetic polarization decreased. We have already reported that Nd(or Pr)-Fe-B thick films with rare-earth amount less than 15 at. % deposited on Si substrates were broken after a post annealing process [3], however the Pr amounts could be reduced down to approximately 13 at. % without the deterioration of mechanical properties on glass substrates. It was also confirmed that an approximately 100μm -thick Pr-Fe-B thick film with (BH)max of about 80 kJ/m3 could be deposited on a glass substrate.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479976","","Substrates;Glass;Thick films;Magnetic films;Micromechanical devices;Silicon","annealing;boron alloys;buffer layers;coercive force;iron alloys;laser materials processing;magnetic hysteresis;magnetic thin films;metallic thin films;permanent magnets;praseodymium alloys","glass substrate;rare earth permanent magnet films;magnetic properties;mechanical properties;hard magnetic phase;magnetic polarization;metal buffer layer;YAG pulse laser;laser beam;pulse annealing;coercivity;Si;PrXFe14B","","","","3","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Site-disorder in bulk GFO is reported to be induced by adopting different preparation conditions and methods, which are shown to affect the magnetic properties significantly [1]-[3]. Moreover, the physical properties of GFO at reduced grain sizes remain underexplored due to the challenges associated with their synthesis with a proper control over the crystalline phase. In addition, the origin of the doping effects on the correlation between the site-disorder and magnetism in the nanosized GFO system has not yet been completely established. Therefore, it is worthy to explore the possibility of tuning the magnetic properties of doped GFO nanoparticles. In this work, we prepare a series of Ga1-xMgxFeO3 (GMFOx) (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) nanoparticles by a modified Pechini method to systematically study the effect of Mg-doping on their structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties. Interestingly, the magnetization and electric polarization of the doped samples are enhanced compared to those of the pristine sample of GFO. The magnetic hysteresis curves measured below the FM transition temperature (TC) exhibit two-phase-like magnetic behavior consisting of soft and hard magnetic phases. The results could be explained by the site-disorder of the cations in GMFOx. Furthermore, thermo-magnetic irreversibility and cusp in zero-field cooled magnetization are observed for all the GMFOx nanocrystals, which are attributed to the inherent magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, variable temperature dielectric measurements show an anomaly in the dielectric constant at the temperature close to the TC indicates the magnetoelectric coupling of the GMFOx nanocrystals. These results open wide perspectives for the room temperature FM magnetoelectric GFO ferrite in spintronic devices.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479903","","Magnetic hysteresis;Magnetoelectric effects;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Temperature measurement;Nanocrystals;Frequency modulation","doping;ferrimagnetic materials;gallium compounds;grain size;magnesium;magnetic anisotropy;magnetic hysteresis;magnetic transition temperature;magnetoelectric effects;nanomagnetics;nanoparticles;permittivity;piezoelectric materials","magnetic properties;physical properties;crystalline phase;doping effects;magnetism;modified Pechini method;nanocrystals;piezoelectric ordering;magnetoelectric ferrimagnet;grain size;nanoparticles;magnetization;electric polarization;dielectric constant;spintronic devices;ferrimagnetic ordering;magnetoelectric coupling;inherent magnetic anisotropy;thermo-magnetic irreversibility;FM transition temperature;magnetic hysteresis curves;dielectric properties;structural properties;GaFeO3:Mg","","","","3","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Herein, we investigated influence of different termination layers of lanthanum strontium manganite (LSMO) on the interfacial electronic and magnetic properties of LSMO/Alq3 heterostructures. Different termination layers of LSMO with LSO, MnO2 and mixed terminations were prepared to examine the spin interface of LSMO/Alq3. From experimental results, the outermost layer of LSO and mixed terminations exhibited significant SrO segregation while less segregation was found for MnO2. In addition, the surface SrO segregation correlates to the variation of surface magnetic properties and the formation of surface dipole at the mixed LMSO/Alq3, MnO2-ter/Alq3, and LSO-ter/Alq3 interfaces.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479888","","Magnetic properties;Spintronics;Nanotechnology;Synchrotron radiation;Materials science and technology;Photonics;Electronic mail","ferromagnetic materials;interface magnetism;interface structure;lanthanum compounds;magnetoelectronics;manganese compounds;organic semiconductors;organic-inorganic hybrid materials;spin polarised transport;spin valves;strontium compounds;surface magnetism;surface segregation","surface segregation;surface dipole;surface magnetic properties;interfacial electronic properties;spin-polarized charge carriers;organic spin valves;spin injection;organic-ferromagnetic hybrid structures;interfacial regions;organic spintronics;termination effect;SrO;MnO2;La1-xSrxMnO3","","","","1","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The strain relaxation process in epitaxially grown thin-film is pretty common [1] and the strain relaxed induced defects were detailed analysed by high resolution transmission electron microscope(HRTEM), as shown in Fig. 1(a)-(c). The relation between stacking faults induced by the strain relaxation, which act as strong domain wall pinning sites, and perpendicular coercivity (Hc,⊥) of FePd films prepared at 400-700°C have been investigated. The variation of Hc is shown in Fig. 1(d). Hc,⊥ can be enhanced via raising the stacking fault densities, which can be promoted by climbing dissociation [2]. The increased stacking fault densities with large Hc,⊥(6kOe) is obtained for samples prepared at 650 °C. On the other hand, Hc,⊥ drops significantly prepared at 700°C and treated with post-annealing at 700°C for 5hs, resulting from reducing stacking fault density. This result suggests the coercivity can be manipulated via controlling stacking fault density in FePd film, which may pave a way for future magnetic devices.","","978-1-5090-4383-5","10.1109/ICAUMS.2016.8479688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479688","","Stacking;Films;Strain;Iron;Materials science and technology;Electronic mail","annealing;coercive force;electron beam deposition;iron alloys;magnetic domain walls;magnetic thin films;palladium alloys;perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;stacking faults;transmission electron microscopy","HRTEM;stacking faults induced domain wall pinning;stacking fault density;high resolution transmission electron microscopy;FePd (001) thin films;perpendicular coercivity;strain relaxation process;perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;electron beam deposition system;temperature 400 degC to 700 degC;time 5 hour;FePd;MgO","","","","2","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, comparatively few experimental investigations have been conducted on the magnetic antivortex (AV) spin configuration, in part because they are more difficult to create. The AV, the topological counterpart of a magnetic vortex, involves spins that sweep in towards a central core from two opposing directions and away in the other directions. It is a potentially interesting configuration for magnonics devices since AV's will form at cross-like intersections and the spin configuration in these structures is such that the magnetization blends smoothly from the intersection region into the wires, which should facilitate SW propagation. In this work, we show that the AV state can be reliably created in micron-sized Permalloy nanostructures with a pound-key-like shape by using shape anisotropy to control the reversal process [1], and we show experimental measurements of the high-frequency spin dynamics of the magnetic AV's in these structures, made using micro-focus Brillouin light scattering (micro-BLS) [2]. Micro-BLS spectra, measured at ~250-nm spots at various locations on the patterned structures for samples in both the AV and saturated configurations, show that the dynamics of an AV are more complex than those of a magnetic vortex. Strong modes were detected in the 5-6 GHz range independent of the spin configuration and spatial scans show that these modes are more closely associated with the microstrips than the intersection; however, at lower frequencies, distinct dynamics were observed for the AV. Several of the detected AV modes are close in frequency to azimuthal-like modes observed in micromagnetic simulations and, furthermore, the simulations at the azimuthal spin wave frequencies show that intersection spin state can influence the dominant wavevector in the structure legs, which is of potential interest for magnonics devices since many proposed devices require high wavenumber excitations.
