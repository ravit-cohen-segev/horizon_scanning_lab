"Querying RDF Data: a Multigraph‐based Approach","V. Ingalalli; D. Ienco; P. Poncelet",NA; NA; NA,"NoSQL Data Models: Trends and Challenges","","2018","","","135","165","Resource description framework (RDF) data are cherished and exploited by various domains such as life sciences, Semantic Web and social networks. This chapter provides basic definitions on the interplay between RDF and its multigraph representation. The multigraph representation enables to construct lightweight indexing structures that ameliorate the time performance of Attributed Multigraph Based Engine for RDF querying (AMbER). The chapter discusses a graph‐based RDF querying engine, AMbER, which involves two steps. The first step is an offline step, where RDF data are transformed into multigraph and are indexed. The second step is an online step, where an efficient approach to answer a SPARQL query is proposed. The proposed engine AMbER has been tested over large RDF triplestores. The chapter focuses on the SELECT/WHERE clause of the SPARQL language, which constitutes the most important operation of any RDF query engine.","","9781119544135","10.1002/9781119528227.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075021.pdf&bkn=10074974&pdfType=chapter","","Resource description framework;Rough surfaces;Dictionaries;Standards;Engines;Indexing;Data models","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The chapter develops the term discrimination values (TDV) weighting approach adapted to the Pub/Sub context, which is more convenient for the filtering step. TDV computation is a heavy process that requires evaluation of the density of a collection of items. The chapter explains how to provide better solutions to compute TDV. It compares the quality of the system with different settings and a top‐k approach and shows that real‐time delivery is a strong constraint which the system guarantees with a TDV‐weighted coverage combined with diversity.","","9781119544135","10.1002/9781119528227.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075027.pdf&bkn=10074974&pdfType=chapter","","Real-time systems;Data models;Vocabulary;IEEE Sections;Filtering;Automobiles;Redundancy","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

RDF data graphs can be produced without a predefined schema and SPARQL allows querying both schema and instance information simultaneously. The chapter presents the challenges and solutions for efficiently processing SPARQL queries and in particular basic graph pattern (BGP) expressions. The main challenge in processing complex graph pattern queries is to optimize the join operations which dominate the cost of all other operators. The chapter introduces the specific solution using the MapReduce framework for processing SPARQL graph patterns. It describes the use of Apache Spark and explains the importance of the physical data layers for the query performance.

It focuses on the language aspect of NoSQL systems, and highlights two main trends in French research that pertains to NoSQL languages and systems. The first trend aims to add support for well‐known, relational operations to NoSQL databases. The second trend of research is aimed at unifying NoSQL systems, in particular their query languages. Data processing operations generally consist of filtering, aggregation and grouping and exposing a MapReduce‐like interface. Most NoSQL databases do not support join operations, rather they rely on data denormalization to achieve similar results, at the cost of more storage usage and more maintenance effort. While relational databases started both from a formal foundation and solid implementations, NoSQL databases have developed rapidly as implementation artifacts.","","9781119544135","10.1002/9781119528227.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10075047.pdf&bkn=10074974&pdfType=chapter","","Distributed databases;Data models;Big Data;Cloud computing;Market research;Java;Feeds","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Variables: Declaration, Definition and Type","R. Jeansoulin","University of Provence, France","JavaScript and Open Data","","2018","","","5","17","Variables are made to receive values directly or through evaluated expressions compounding values and operators or results of function calls: the value is stored internally and the variable references this storage, and takes its value and its type. To fetch the value of a variable, it must have been identified in the lexical phase: which means to be “declared”. Often, JavaScript code starts with declaration instructions. This chapter looks back at the two steps in the interpretation of JavaScript (simplified): lexical‐time and run‐time. It details this double mechanism: declaration of the variables, initialization to undefined at lexical‐time and definition of the variables at run‐time. For a better understanding of the declaration mechanism in JavaScript, we must first learn what the “scope” of a variable is: the function declarations determine the overall logics of the notion of scope.","","9781119527305","10.1002/9781119451761.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10067184.pdf&bkn=10066955&pdfType=chapter","","Reactive power;Containers;Open data;Codes;Engines;Syntactics;Indexes","","","","","","","","13 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The topological relations involves sharing a vertex, being included or intersecting each other. This chapter presents the basic use of one library, open source, which is complete enough to sample all of the most useful features, in a way similar to those of proprietary libraries such as Google, Bing and Yahoo. That library is OpenLayers, code licensed under the “<i>2‐Clause BSD</i>”, with a very active community.

It explores how the signs and words interact with the syntax. The chapter describes how to use programming constraints to style a more readable and robust code and a few hints about meta‐programming. In any language there are reserved words, sacred or forbidden, and one must replace them. In any language, punctuation plays a role in the interpretation. In any language there are pronouns, a grammatical form referring to another form, and whenever referencing, ambiguities may occur. Keywords, punctuation signs and a misused pronoun are often error prone in JavaScript. The chapter discusses some programming best practices: design patterns. In object‐oriented programming, any instruction is in the context of one object: the global object or a particular object.

Programming in the web ecosystem, that is to say, in the context the Internet, means that the speed of communication and the volume of exchanged data impact the processes. In 2005, that object was standardized by ECMA and was popularized under the name Asynchronous Javascript And XML (AJAX). AJAX allows access to the data files, under a variety of formats, served by web servers or smaller remote applications called Web Apps. There are four request modes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. A “Promise” is an object that represents the return of an async operation. The use of then() is called an “asynchronous function call”, and it returns a new “Promise” which, in turn, can be “then‐ified”. Accessing remote servers with AJAX is severely restricted for security reasons. The “Same Origin Policy” (SOP) restricts access to files present in the same domain, which means a local file.","","9781119527305","10.1002/9781119451761.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10067230.pdf&bkn=10066955&pdfType=chapter","","XML;Open data;Web pages;Programming;Internet;Codes;Wrapping","","","","","","","","13 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The syntax of an “array literal” uses [square brackets] to delimit a list of elements, which can be primitive values, variable names, objects and functions, separated by commas. The property length is permanently updated, returning the index of the last element plus one. Adding or removing an element in the array immediately modifies length. This chapter explores the methods of the object Array and Array.prototype. The arrow syntax can be used everywhere for function expressions, and in particular in the context of array methods, it may ease code readability. The “spreadsheet” is the most common pattern for simple databases. There exist some stable and safe frameworks providing additional methods to arrays, though “masked” in their “namespace”.","","9781119527305","10.1002/9781119451761.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10066857.pdf&bkn=10066955&pdfType=chapter","","Arrays;Indexes;Open data;Voting;Task analysis;Syntactics;Internet","","","","","","","","13 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter presents the notions of “scope” and “execution context”, which will shed light upon the mechanisms of “function closure” and immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). A function can be set for the same syntax in two ways: by declaration or by expression. The operator (parentheses), also called “grouping operator” or “precedence operator”, is used in arithmetic or logic expressions or regular expressions. The chapter explores the three facets of the “parentheses operator” in a function context: parameters delimiter, arguments delimiter and immediate invocation.

"Data Served by JSONP","R. Jeansoulin","University of Provence, France","JavaScript and Open Data","","2018","","","229","234","This chapter expresses that the “padding” of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to JSON with padding, JSONP is a workaround to avoid the rule of the same origin policy. JSONP was experimented in order to allow an object literal (JSON format), to be readable as a valid JavaScript code when the script engine is triggered by the tag. The Google global object proposes methods for handling the spreadsheet as well as preparing the JSONP. Yahoo proposes a request service whose syntax mimics an SQL command line: it is named Yahoo Query Language (YQL). For instance, a YQL request is able to query and send back data from an RSS feed. The chapter describes different coding method of sending the JSONP request: the &lt;script&gt; tag will be inserted into the DOM by the first &lt;script&gt;, now alone. The other difference is that Flickr is both an image repository service and a JSONP service, therefore, the same URL hosts the two services.","","9781119527305","10.1002/9781119451761.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10067202.pdf&bkn=10066955&pdfType=chapter","","Internet;Codes;Servers;Uniform resource locators;Syntactics;Multimedia Web sites;Image databases","","","","","","","","13 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The HTML DOM is a tree: a root, followed by child nodes, recursively up to terminal nodes, empty‐tags or text‐nodes. The layout engine builds the tree while parsing the HTML document step by step in “depth‐first” mode. The link between a DOM element and a CSS rule is established through the CSS selectors: a similar link can be established from JavaScript. JavaScript can also handle the CSS rules linked to a specific DOM element. When loading the page in the browser, several objects are created and stored in a tree structure called the “Browser Object Model” (BOM).

"Controls: Booleans, Branch and Loops","R. Jeansoulin","University of Provence, France","JavaScript and Open Data","","2018","","","19","26","A control is a boolean context that is defined by the syntax of a conditional instruction: branch and loop. There are two boolean values: true and false. In a boolean context, the values of type string or number are cast to a boolean, and values undefined and null are evaluated as false. The value undefined is characteristic of a never defined variable. The type “undefined” applies to a never defined variable and to a never declared variable. The chapter focuses on boolean operators, relational operators and comparison operators. The boolean operators are evaluated with the shortcut rule: the next operand is evaluated depending on the status of the test after the previous operand evaluation. The chapter also focuses on exception handling and provides some examples for comparison operators, conditional instructions and ternary conditional operator.","","9781119527305","10.1002/9781119451761.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10067210.pdf&bkn=10066955&pdfType=chapter","","Switches;Syntactics;Indexes;Codes;Open data;Reactive power;C++ languages","","","","","","","","13 Mar 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This paper aims to focus on the development of test scenarios and bicyclist surrogate for evaluating vehicle-bicyclist AEB systems. Design/methodology/approach - The harmonized general estimates system (GES)/FARS 2010-2011 crash data and TASI 110-car naturalistic driving data (NDD) are used to determine the crash geometries and environmental factors of crash scenarios including lighting conditions, vehicle speeds, bicyclist speeds, etc. A surrogate bicyclist including a bicycle rider and a bicycle surrogate is designed to match the visual and radar characteristics of bicyclists in the USA. A bicycle target is designed with both leg pedaling and wheel rotation to produce proper micro-Doppler features and generate realistic motion for camera-based AEB systems. Findings - Based on the analysis of the harmonized GES/FARS crash data, five crash scenarios are recommended for performance testing of bicyclist AEB systems. Combined with TASI 110-car naturalistic driving data, the crash environmental factors including lighting conditions, obscuring objects, vehicle speed and bicyclist speed are determined. The surrogate bicyclist was designed to represent the visual and radar characteristics of the real bicyclists in the USA. The height of the bicycle rider mannequin is 173 cm, representing the weighted height of 50th percentile US male and female adults. The size and shape of the surrogate bicycle were determined as 26-inch wheel and mountain/road bicycle frame, respectively. Both leg pedaling motion and wheel rotation are suggested to produce proper micro-Doppler features and support the camera-based AEB systems. Originality/value - The results have demonstrated that the developed scenarios, test procedures and bicyclist surrogate will provide effective objective methods and necessary hardware and software tools for the evaluation and validation of bicyclist AEB systems.

Design/methodology/approach - An optimization algorithm, model predictive control (MPC) and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are adopted to resolve the problems of obtaining optimal lane time, tracking dynamic reference and energy-efficient allocation. In this paper, the dynamic constraints of vehicles during lane change are first established based on the longitudinal and lateral force coupling characteristics and the nominal reference trajectory. Then, by optimizing the lane change time, the yaw rate and lateral acceleration that connect with the lane change time are limed. Furthermore, to assure the dynamic properties of autonomous vehicles, the real system inputs under the restraints are obtained by using the MPC method. Based on the gained inputs and the efficient map of brushless direct-current in-wheel motors (BLDC IWMs), the nonlinear cost function which combines vehicle dynamic and energy consumption is given and the KKT-based method is adopted. Findings - The effectiveness of the proposed control system is verified by numerical simulations. Consequently, the proposed control system can successfully achieve stable trajectory planning, which means that the yaw rate and longitudinal and lateral acceleration of vehicle are within stability boundaries, which accomplishes accurate tracking control and decreases obvious energy consumption. Originality/value - This paper proposes a solution to simultaneously satisfy stable lane change maneuvering and reduction of energy consumption for autonomous electric vehicles. Different from previous path planning researches in which only the geometric constraints are involved, this paper considers vehicle dynamics, and stability boundaries are established in path planning to ensure the feasibility of the generated reference path.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-12-2017-0002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996445","Autonomous electric vehicle;Energy-efficient control allocation;Lane change maneuver;Stable trajectory planning","Trajectory;1/f noise;Vehicle dynamics;Stability analysis;Path planning;Energy consumption;Control systems","","","","1","","","","22 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The decision-making issues in a traffic environment are formulated as the MDP by defining basic elements including states, actions and basic models. Transition and reward models are defined by using a complete prediction model of the surrounding cars.

Blindly using feature could take up large storage and excessive computation time, while insufficient feature selection would cause poor performance. Selecting high contributive features to classify LC and lane-keep behavior is effective for maneuver recognition. This paper aims to propose a feature selection method from a statistical view based on an analysis from naturalistic driving data. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 1,375 LC cases are analyzed. To comprehensively select features, the authors extract the feature candidates from both time and frequency domains with various LC scenarios segmented by an occupancy schedule grid. Then the effect size (Cohen's d) and p-value of every feature are computed to assess their contribution for each scenario. Findings - It has been found that the common lateral features, e.g. yaw rate, lateral acceleration and time-to-lane crossing, are not strong features for recognition of LC maneuver as empirical knowledge. Finally, cross-validation tests are conducted to evaluate model performance using metrics of receiver operating characteristic. Experimental results show that the selected features can achieve better recognition performance than using all the features without purification. Originality/value - In this paper, the authors investigate the contributions of each feature from the perspective of statistics based on big naturalistic driving data. The aim is to comprehensively figure out different types of features in LC maneuvers and select the most contributive features over various LC scenarios.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-09-2018-0010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996451","Feature selection;Machine learning;Effect size;Lane-change maneuvers;Naturalistic driving data","Feature extraction;Vehicles;Context modeling;Behavioral sciences;Automobiles;Vehicle dynamics;Time series analysis","","","","2","","","","22 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

One of the key technologies is that the intelligent system can identify the driver's driving intention in real time to implement consistent driving decisions. The purpose of this study is to establish a driver intention prediction model. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used the NIRx device to measure the cerebral cortex activities for identifying the driver's braking intention. The experiment was carried out in a virtual reality environment. During the experiment, the driving simulator recorded the driving data and the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device recorded the changes in hemoglobin concentration in the cerebral cortex. After the experiment, the driver's braking intention identification model was established through the principal component analysis and back propagation neural network. Findings - The research results showed that the accuracy of the model established in this paper was 80.39 per cent. And, the model could identify the driver's braking intent prior to his braking operation. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study was that the experimental environment was ideal and did not consider the surrounding traffic. At the same time, other actions of the driver were not taken into account when establishing the braking intention recognition model. Besides, the verification results obtained in this paper could only reflect the results of a few drivers' identification of braking intention.

Design/methodology/approach - Seventeen drivers were divided into the automated operation group and manual operation group. Drivers in each group were instructed to travel along the expressway and proceed to the specified destinations. The automated operation group was forced to select a course after receiving a Request to Intervene (RtI) from an automated driving system. Findings - A driver who used the automated operation system tended to not take over the driving operation correctly when a lane change is immediately required after the RtI. Originality/value - This is a fundamental research that examined how the automated driving operation affects the driver's own localization. The experimental results suggest that it is not enough to simply issue an RtI, and it is necessary to tell the driver what kind of circumstances he/she is in and what they should do next through the HMI.

Next, it discusses three security perimeters associated with an end point computing device. They include outer perimeter, inner perimeter, and interior assets. The first level of securing the intelligent devices is to control access to them. The most obvious point of access through the outer perimeter of a personal computer (PC) would be its basic input devices: its keyboard and mouse or touch‐sensitive display. There is one basic security tool built into the hardware of most PCs that offers some basic protection before the operating system bootup completes. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) offers basic hardware security options that can be set through its BIOS Setup utility, also called the CMOS Setup utility.

Relational data storage systems were appropriate for transaction processing and gave the necessary security and reliability guarantees. Analysis‐based information systems are systems that are necessary to store data and make it ready for analysis. The contents of a data warehouse can be characterised as having four main features, which reveal the significant differences to other operational data: topic orientation, logical integration and homogenisation, presence of a reference period and low volatility. The aim of both data warehouses and big data architecture is an enterprise‐wide integration of all relevant data into a consistent set in a continuous system model.","","9781119125143","10.1002/9781119125167.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821440.pdf&bkn=9820799&pdfType=chapter","","Big Data;Business;Companies;Information systems;Real-time systems;Costs;Social networking (online)","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Short",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Cybersecurity Essentials","","2018","","","511","534","Some organizations dedicate a portion of their network to a security structure called a demilitarized zone (DMZ). The DMZ is a separate perimeter network that isolates the secure intranet from the outside world, yet enables public access to outward‐facing dedicated resources. Access to the DMZ is controlled by one or more firewalls. Dual firewalls are used to route public traffic to the DMZ and internal network traffic to the intranet. Honeypots are another perimeter network‐security structure used to lure attackers away from gaining access to legitimate intranet resources. This structure is used in some larger networks that have extremely critical resources. The extranet creates a special security zone that extends the network to the other trusted organization. This zone can also employ secure communication techniques such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or tunnels between the two organizations.","","9781119362432","10.1002/9781119369141.ch21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821498.pdf&bkn=9820804&pdfType=chapter","","Firewalls (computing);Internet;Security;Logic gates;Software;Routing protocols;Modems","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Hashing introduces one‐way algorithms that are used in many areas of a cryptocurrency. The chapter then extends the concept of a one‐way algorithm into the creation of a derived public key from a private key. The process of how a public/private key system works is quite simple and is important to understand as it builds upon hashing to provide a fundamental understanding of cryptocurrency systems. The chapter describes the RSA methodology processes in a very simplified manner, and explains how Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) works in the simplest way possible. It helps the reader to learn that a Bitcoin address is merely a public key that can be used to carry out a transaction and that if an investigator has access to a private key, he or she owns control of any funds available in derived public key addresses.","","9781119480570","10.1002/9781119549314.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822647.pdf&bkn=9820817&pdfType=chapter","","Databases;Passwords;Digital forensics;Companies;Calculators;Transform coding;Random access memory","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Coaxial cable is familiar to most people as the conductor that carries cable TV into their homes. Coaxial cable is constructed with an insulated solid or stranded wire core surrounded by a dielectric insulating layer and a solid or braided metallic shield. Fiber‐optic cable is plastic or glass cable designed to carry digital data in the form of light pulses. The signals are introduced into the cable by a laser diode and bounce along its interior until they reach the end of the cable. Wireless networks connect computer nodes using high‐frequency radio waves.

The most important of these is the data frame, in which, eventually, almost all of the data will be held. A data frame is part matrix, part list, and in order to use data frames most efficiently, data handler needs to be able to think of it in both ways. The chapter encounters matrices in the data cleaning world, since the table() command can produce something that is basically a matrix. There are several functions that help data handlers to examine the data frame. There are essentially three ways to combine data frames: by columns (i.e., combining horizontally); by rows (i.e., stacking vertically); and matching up rows using a key (merging). The chapter further describes these tasks, as well as some other actions to perform on data frames.","","9781119080077","10.1002/9781119080053.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821139.pdf&bkn=9820797&pdfType=chapter","","Cleaning;Data mining;Web pages;Symbols;Periodic structures;Buildings","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Big data as well as traditional analytics search for extracting value from datasets. The added value of big data is the ability to identify useful data and turn it into usable information by identifying patterns, exploiting new algorithms, tools and new project solutions.","","9781119528067","10.1002/9781119528043.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821551.pdf&bkn=9820813&pdfType=chapter","","Data analysis;Big Data;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Data mining;Predictive analytics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It then reviews existing fast prototyping platforms for IoT. This review will take into consideration both the prototyping and performance evaluation aspects of protocols, as well as the ability to test application‐level use cases. There is a strong need for an open platform for fast prototyping of network protocols as well as connected devices for wireless sensor networks and the device layer (DL) of the IoT. Real and pragmatic evaluation is a strong expectation. To meets the needs, the chapter discusses an architecture model, referred to as “wireless node” (WiNo), as well as the different versions of this model in an evaluation platform, offering a wide variety of physical layers. It further illustrates several instantiations of the proposed model and also details several results and examples of use of the WiNo architecture.","","9781119549758","10.1002/9781119549765.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822816.pdf&bkn=9820818&pdfType=chapter","","Protocols;Internet of Things;Standards;Hardware;Physical layer;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless personal area networks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A person may be using a cryptocurrency to buy goods online that are illegal. In the same manner as someone buying illegal goods, a trader in illegal merchandise may come to the attention of the authorities for different reasons other than using cryptocurrency payments. Many ways to steal a cryptocurrency exist that are not related to technological crime. Money laundering is the process of taking the proceeds of crime and combining those funds with legitimate funds and transactions to obfuscate their origins. The days of leaving a suitcase full of cash on some remote rough ground in order to secure the release of a kidnap victim are probably long gone. Cash was often tagged so it could be traced and the drop site surveilled, which meant that picking up the bag was fraught with dangers of being caught.","","9781119480570","10.1002/9781119549314.ch15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822277.pdf&bkn=9820817&pdfType=chapter","","Blockchains;Bitcoin;Mixers;IP networks;Law enforcement;Lakes;Internet","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Customer relationship management (CRM) underwent some major development at the end of the 20th Century with the advent of the Internet and e‐commerce websites. More than an evolution, it was a revolution for the consumer, who could now compare multiple offers of goods or services in just a few clicks. These new opportunities had a direct impact on the relationships between suppliers and their customers, who ultimately became “everyone's” customers. Social CRM allows one to expand the scope of CRM and take a big step toward customer experience management (CXM) through a more refined and expanded understanding of the customers. The CXM approach aims to offer a service, an individual experience, by placing customer expectations at the heart of the company's responsibilities.","","9781119489269","10.1002/9781119426653.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821416.pdf&bkn=9820808&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Customer relationship management;Social networking (online);Smart phones;Internet;Big Data;Electronic commerce","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Every networking course examines the OSI model in terms of what types of devices, protocols, and functions exist at each level. However, different cybersecurity challenges may be present at each level. Network topologies are Layer 1—physical or logical—connection strategies that fall into four basic types of configurations: star, bus, ring, and mesh. In order for devices to communicate with each other on the network, they must all use the same network protocol. The most basic address in networking operations is the Media Access Control (MAC) address that serves as a unique identifier for every device attached to a network. Two common types of attacks typically are aimed at the MAC layer of a network: MAC spoofing and MAC broadcast flooding.","","9781119362432","10.1002/9781119369141.ch17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821409.pdf&bkn=9820804&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Security;TCPIP;Permission;Network topology;Computers;Topology","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Finding a suspect in the real world from blockchain transactions can be very challenging, and unless the investigators are able to make legal requests for information from service providers, it can be almost impossible. The Bitnodes site and application programming interface (API) can be very useful to an investigator who has an IP as part of his investigation and wants to know if it was a Bitcoin node as well as for an investigator who wants to know more about a transaction. The chapter considers methods where the investigators can use IP addresses to try to find the source of a transaction, and explains how to find information using open‐source methods including on the dark web.","","9781119480570","10.1002/9781119549314.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822597.pdf&bkn=9820817&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Bitcoin;Peer-to-peer computing;Blockchains;Uniform resource locators;Watches;Relays","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This includes extracting pieces of strings, formatting numbers as text, and searching for matches inside text. The length of a character vector is, as with other vectors, the number of elements it has. In the case of a character vector, data handlers might want to know how many characters are in each element. R formats entries in a numeric vector for display, but that formatting is part of the print‐out, not part of the vector, and the formatting can change when the vector changes. The chapter also describes some of the details of those formatting choices. It further describes how R uses scientific notation, and how data handlers can create categorical versions of numeric vectors. Finally, the chapter examines how factors are created, how they behave, and how to get them to do what data handlers want them to do.","","9781119080077","10.1002/9781119080053.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821385.pdf&bkn=9820797&pdfType=chapter","","Cleaning;Venus;Mercury (planets);Mars;Europe;Data mining;Social networking (online)","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Two essential components are needed to question whether data analytics can or cannot add value: data and a well‐defined problem. It is essential to have at least a basic notion of statistics and mathematics to determine the right analysis technique according to the nature of each data. For data analytics, preference is given mainly to computer languages, which are standardized for data analysis and information extraction. The more important data analytics process can be divided into the following phases: data collection, data preparation, data analysis, evaluation and interpretation and model deployment. The phases are supported by a range of data management and analysis disciplines: statistics, machine learning, data mining, text mining, database management systems and data streams management systems.","","9781119528067","10.1002/9781119528043.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823049.pdf&bkn=9820813&pdfType=chapter","","Big Data;Data analysis;Task analysis;Data visualization;Real-time systems;Computers;Companies","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

One of the main tools for protecting the file system and its data is the use of access control lists (ACLs). The main user authentication tool used with personal computing devices is the username and password login. Operating systems provide password‐lockout policy settings that enable administrators to enact password policies that prevent attackers from repeatedly trying to access the system. Auditing is a security function of the operating system that enables the user and operating system activities performed on a computer to be monitored and tracked. Computer‐based intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be implemented in two ways: as network‐based IDS (NIDS) or as host‐based IDS (HIDS).

Police forces, government agencies, and private investigation firms are currently debating the correct procedures for seizure either at a live crime scene or later during an investigation. Traditionally, Financial investigators (FI's) are long‐time police officers with financial training, or forensic accountants with an eye for the unusual in bank and company account records. To trace the movement of money, investigators work with anti‐fraud departments in banks and other financial institutions. For an investigation department to carry out effective cryptocurrency investigations requires a coming together of the FIs and digital forensics departments. Different countries use different terminology for the seizure of assets—some mean the same thing, while others have a variety of connotations.

These algorithms are based on neural networks modeled from the functioning of humans' own brain neurons. These algorithms are capable of learning (just like humans) and ultimately discovering the world around them by themselves. This chapter argues that one forms of intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI), that is mainly driven by data. AI gained ground, and it “infiltrated” companies based on two important developments: the use of the graphic processing unit (GPU) instead of the central processing unit; and the continuous digitization of the world around the Internet and connected devices is the source of “Big Data”. These Big Data have become the raw material necessary to feed these algorithms.","","9781119489269","10.1002/9781119426653.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821524.pdf&bkn=9820808&pdfType=chapter","","Artificial intelligence;Neurons;Big Data;Prediction algorithms;Classification algorithms;Expert systems;Biology","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter focuses on the access‐control and monitoring systems. The basis of designing efficient access‐control systems involves three terms: ingress, egress, and regress. Access control involves being able to control the ingress, egress, and regress to an asset based on authorization. Businesses and organizations develop comprehensive security policies that define who is authorized to access different assets and what they are allowed to do with those assets when they do access them. Remote‐access monitoring systems are used to notify supervisory security personnel when an unauthorized access is attempted. Next, the chapter highlights the application of the following concepts of physical security: access control, physical barriers, and biometrics. It further identifies commonly used physical access‐control systems/devices, such as keypads, card readers, electronic deadbolts, and magnetic locks.","","9781119362432","10.1002/9781119369141.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821185.pdf&bkn=9820804&pdfType=chapter","","Computer security;Monitoring;Law;Control systems;Buildings;Authorization;Aerospace electronics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The book helps the readers to test their knowledge related to internet access and security. Most companies and residential users subscribe to Internet access services from an internet service provider (ISP). Some ISPs will block certain ports in a misguided attempt to minimize the impact of malware, viruses, and worms. The most common first line of defense in a network connected to the Internet is a firewall. Data security is deployed to prevent data misdirection through encryption or live capture. These devices usually consist of some combination of hardware and software used to protect a private network from unauthorized access by way of the Internet. This is accomplished by limiting security exposures, enforcing the organization's security policy, and sometimes logging or monitoring internet activity.","","9781119362432","10.1002/9781119369141.ch25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821031.pdf&bkn=9820804&pdfType=chapter","","Authentication;Security;Protocols;Internet;IP networks;Viruses (medical);Passwords","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

OSs and the programs and data they control are attacked from two common areas: by manipulating the operation of the OS kernel; and by attacking its file management system. Attackers who possess enough knowledge of a given OS's memory‐handling strategy can exploit the OS kernel. Most OSs utilize the no execution (NX) bit, or the execute disable (XD) bit to protect certain areas of memory. One of the main tools for protecting the file system and its data is the use of access control lists (ACLs) to provide resources access control.","","9781119362432","10.1002/9781119369141.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821233.pdf&bkn=9820804&pdfType=chapter","","Operating systems;Hardware;Random access memory;Printers;Microprocessors;Logic gates;Keyboards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Furneaux",NA,"Investigating Cryptocurrencies: Understanding, Extracting, and Analyzing Blockchain Evidence","","2018","","","109","116","This chapter covers the ability of some cryptocurrencies to encode contracts within a transaction. This feature, especially of contract‐based cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, has led to companies releasing tokens based on the blockchain, which hold the promise of some reward when the business performs well. Bitcoin and its derivative cryptocurrencies carry the ability to embed small amounts of data, whether code or text, to act as a contract. Bitcoin's ability to have multi‐signature transactions means that both parties can sign the transaction, and it's then on the blockchain forever. Ethereum is being extensively used to launch funding campaigns for new products and services. This involves creating a type of contract called a token. The chapter looks at some of the Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) coming up at the time of writing includes a system based around a blockchain for finding return loads in the shipping industry or to enable non‐technical people to create Ethereum contracts.","","9781119480570","10.1002/9781119549314.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822703.pdf&bkn=9820817&pdfType=chapter","","Contracts;Blockchains;Automobiles;Bitcoin;Software;Companies;Public key","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Data as a product is currently a relatively new concept, but as people become more aware of the importance of data, they will be more likely to demand data‐driven information and services. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) possess large quantities of data, and are realising that, rather than being detrimental in terms of collection and storage costs, their data is valuable. SMEs often have problems selecting appropriate IT and even companies that have IT resources may not understand or fully utilise its functionality. Stakeholder analysis feeds into many parts of the business plan and should be carefully reviewed as part of the decision on how to monetise company data. New data forms and increasingly unusual applications may prove intractable to current methods. The practitioner should not be bound to using established methods.","","9781119125143","10.1002/9781119125167.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821298.pdf&bkn=9820799&pdfType=chapter","","Business;Reliability;Market research;Data analysis;Big Data;Project management;Graphics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It defines basic cryptography implementations used to secure data in motion, including encryption, digital signatures, certificate management, public key infrastructure (PKI), public versus private keys, hashing, and key management. The chapter also describes the two major components involved in creating a virtual private network (VPN). After a user has been authenticated and authorized, their activities need to be accounted for by means of some type of logging process. This is an often overlooked concept related to authentication. A number of protocols are used on the Internet for validating access and facilitating secure communications between clients and a server‐based system. Adding a CAPTCHA to a traditional authentication scheme can potentially eliminate any kind of automated password attack. However, they are also a barrier to some users with certain disabilities, unless alternative mechanisms are included that target those users.","","9781119362432","10.1002/9781119369141.ch22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821165.pdf&bkn=9820804&pdfType=chapter","","Authentication;Passwords;Security;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Virtual private networks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Cardon",NA,"Beyond Artificial Intelligence: From Human Consciousness to Artificial Consciousness","","2018","","","1","112","This chapter presents an architecture of the human psychic system by adopting an organizational path. The organizational path considers the psyche as a highly dynamic idea‐generating system that operates continuously at different rates and structures its components on several scales. The chapter shows that the understanding of mental representations always takes place in a specific setting that brings together the psychic system's instances given certain characteristics. The regulators in the mental landscape explicitly act on the forms that they constitute, releasing organizations of aggregates and perceiving the effects, explicitly and systematically, of their meanings. To develop a model of thought generation in a system, it is necessary to precisely clarify the characteristics of the approach as guided by its architecture. Such an approach is based on observations made in neuroscience, which analyzes neuronal activity using photographs of their energy traces.","","9781119551010","10.1002/9781119550983.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822358.pdf&bkn=9820819&pdfType=chapter","","Organizations;Artificial intelligence;Transforms;Synapses;Symbols;Surges;Substrates","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Its raw material is Big Data and it takes just a millisecond (or even less in some cases) to make a decision. Another advantage is its ability to learn, or the ability of AI tools to learn from their experiences: “there is no good or bad choice, there are only experiences”. This is how AI approaches human intelligence, learning from experience and remembering it (one way or another). Descriptive analysis is the data analysis method that is probably the most used by existing BI solutions, whether for sales, marketing, finance or human resources.","","9781119489269","10.1002/9781119426653.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821237.pdf&bkn=9820808&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Artificial intelligence;Business intelligence;Big Data;Decision making;Internet;Process control","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It concerns supervised learning prediction procedures involving multivariate analysis (classical statistical) methods and then other data mining methods. The chapter also concerns unsupervised learning, covering clustering and network methods. Multiple linear regression is used to predict continuous target variables such as turnover or customer expenditure. In regression methods, the model predicting the target is linear: the terms are added together to get the output. Genetic algorithms contribute to the vast range of applications of neural networks in the design process. Bayesian network analysis also seeks to identify relationships and patterns in complex data. The aim of pattern detection methods is to find hitherto unknown relationships and groupings within the data.","","9781119125143","10.1002/9781119125167.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821223.pdf&bkn=9820799&pdfType=chapter","","Predictive models;Logistics;Mathematical models;Business;Linear regression;Analytical models;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Routers are network connectivity devices that forward network information in a manner similar to switches. The microprocessor is a specialized device optimized to operate as a route processor. In communications and digital networking, a gateway is defined as a device that interfaces a network with another network that employs a different protocol. A network bridge (sometimes referred to as a network switch) bridges network segments together and forwards traffic from one network to another. In a wireless network, the network devices connect to the network through a device known as a wireless access point.

Furneaux",NA,"Investigating Cryptocurrencies: Understanding, Extracting, and Analyzing Blockchain Evidence","","2018","","","87","93","Mining is a fairly straightforward process that usually uses specialist equipment to solve hashing problems. It is unlikely that investigators will stumble across a crime that involves mining specifically, but they could get involved in investigating fraudulent mining software, power stealing, or other crimes. Proof‐of‐work is the concept of finding the solution to a hashing problem. In 2018, Ethereum developers are looking to implement proof‐of‐stake to replace proof‐of‐work. Proof‐of‐stake is more environmentally friendly. Although not strictly mining fraud, several software tools are available for free download that purport to do coin mining. For years, criminals have been siphoning power from neighbors or straight from the grid to provide the lighting and heating for growing marijuana. The same process of stealing power could be very useful to a cryptocurrency miner because it would remove a significant proportion of the cost of mining.","","9781119480570","10.1002/9781119549314.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821806.pdf&bkn=9820817&pdfType=chapter","","Bitcoin;Data mining;Proof of Work;Costs;Investment;Business;Writing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The best surveillance cameras employ charged coupled device (CCD) technology. The two important specifications that influence the cost of cameras are light sensitivity rating and resolution. The camera's resolution‐specification method depends on whether it is an analog camera or a digital camera. Surveillance cameras can be mounted outside the facility to provide the ability to recognize someone wishing to enter the security perimeter area such as a front door or driveway gate. The chapter discusses the applications for cameras. The introduction of digital video recorders (DVRs) has greatly reduced the dependence on storage media quality and operator intervention.

Various environmental phenomenon - $P$ monitoring applications dealing with noise pollution, road traffic, requiring spatio-temporal data samples of P (to capture its variations and its profile construction) in the region of interest - can be enabled using PWSN. Because of irregular distribution and uncontrollable mobility of people (with mobile phones), and their willingness to participate, complete spatio-temporal (CST) coverage of $P$ may not be ensured. Therefore, unobserved data values must be estimated for CST profile construction of $P$ and presented in this paper. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, the estimation of these missing data samples both in spatial and temporal dimension is being discussed, and the paper shows that non-parametric technique - Kernel Regression - provides better estimation compared to parametric regression techniques in PWSN context for spatial estimation. Furthermore, the preliminary results for estimation in temporal dimension have been provided. The deterministic and stochastic approaches toward estimation in the context of PWSN have also been discussed. Findings – For the task of spatial profile reconstruction, it is shown that non-parametric estimation technique (kernel regression) gives a better estimation of the unobserved data points. In case of temporal estimation, few preliminary techniques have been studied and have shown that further investigations are required to find out best estimation technique(s) which may approximate the missing observations (temporally) with considerably less error.

However, because most results cannot be observed in real world, the research of crowd network cannot follow a traditional way. Simulation is the main means to put forward related research studies. Compared with other large-scale interactive simulations, simulation for crowd network has challenges of dynamic, diversification and massive participants. Fortunately, known as the most famous and widely accepted standard, high level architecture (HLA) has been widely used in large-scale simulations. But when it comes to crowd network, HLA has shortcomings like fixed federation, limited scale and agreement outside the software system. Design/methodology/approach – This paper proposes a novel reflective memory-based framework for crowd network simulations. The proposed framework adopts a two-level federation-based architecture, which separates simulation-related environments into physical and logical aspect to enhance the flexibility of simulations. Simulation definition is introduced in this architecture to resolve the problem of outside agreements and share resources pool (constructed by reflective memory) is used to address the systemic emergence and scale problem. Findings – With reference to HLA, this paper proposes a novel reflective memory-based framework toward crowd network simulations. The proposed framework adopts a two-level federation-based architecture, system-level simulation (system federation) and application-level simulation (application federations), which separates simulation-related environments into physical and logical aspect to enhance the flexibility of simulations. Simulation definition is introduced in this architecture to resolve the problem of outside agreements and share resources pool (constructed by reflective memory) is used to address the systemic emergence and scale problem. Originality/value – Simulation syntax and semantic are all settled under this framework by templates, especially interface templates, as simulations are separated by two-level federations, physical and logical simulation environment are considered separately; the definition of simulation execution is flexible. When developing new simulations, recompile is not necessary, which can acquire much more reusability, because reflective memory is adopted as share memory within given simulation execution in this framework; population can be perceived by all federates, which greatly enhances the scalability of this kind of simulations; communication efficiency and capability has greatly improved by this share memory-based framework.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-01-2018-0004","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1400105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826631","Crowd network;HLA-high level architecture;Large scale simulation;Reflective memory","Industries;Scalability;Memory management;Sociology;Semantics;Syntactics;Software","","","","2","","11","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Finally, to further validate the findings, this paper aims at the prediction of different levels of attention function based on the attention score obtained from repeatable battery for the assessment of neurophysiological status (RBANS). Design/methodology/approach – The present paper analyzes electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded by a single prefrontal channel from 105 elderly subjects while they were responding to Stroop color test which is an attention-demanded task. Beside Stroop test, subjects also performed RBANS which provides their level of functionality in different domains including attention. After data acquisition (EEG during Stroop test and RBANS attention score), the authors extract the spectral features of EEG as neural indexes of attention and subjects' reaction time in response to Stroop test as behavioral index of attention. Then, they explore the correlation between these post-cue frequency band oscillations of EEG with elderly response time (RT). Next, the authors exploit these findings to classify RBANS attention score. Findings – The observations of this study suggest that there is significant negative correlation between alpha gamma ratio (AGR) and RT ($p < 0.0001$), theta beta ratio (TBR) is positively correlated with subjects' RT ($p < 0.0001$), these correlations are stronger in a 500ms period right after triggering the cue (question onset in Stroop test), and 4) TBR and AGR can be effectively used to predict RBANS attention score. Research limitations/implications – Because of the experiment design, the pre-cue EEG of the next trail was very much overlapped with the post-cue EEG of the current trail. Therefore, the authors could analyze only post-cue EEG. In future study, it would be interesting to investigate the predictability of subject's future performance from pre-cue EEG and mental preparation. Practical implications – This study provides an insight into the research on detection of human attention level from EEG instead of conventional neurophysiological tests. It has also potential to be used in implementation of feasible and efficient EEG-based brain computer interface training systems for elderly. Originality/value – To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is among very few attempts for early prediction of cognitive decline in the domain of attention from brain activity (EEG) instead of conventional tests which are prone to human errors.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-09-2018-0022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826649","Elderly;Spectral analysis;EEG;Attention;Brain-computer interface;RBANS","Training;Brain;Time-frequency analysis;Correlation;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Behavioral sciences","","","","","","21","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

"Bibliography","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","365","456","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology.

Safety-critical system functions rely on a complex system management, which covers fault detection, redundancy management, and isolation of platform modules. Commonly, the system management causes the majority of the development and certification efforts. However, the IMA approach standardizes only the management of the resources and time of each hosted system function on the underlying hardware. Additionally, relevant system management functions - such as redundancy management for the safety-critical applications - is developed and implemented individually in the system function itself. The Flexible Platform, developed by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) at the University of Stuttgart, provides system management mechanisms as a generic software. The approach, presented in this paper, intends to use the Flexible Platform on IMA selectively for safety-critical system functions besides state-of-the-art ARINC653 applications. For the verification of this new approach, a lab demonstrator with industrial IMA modules is established to run predefined demonstration scenarios that validate the key-characteristics of the selectively used Flexible Platform on DIMA architecture.","2155-7209","978-1-5386-4112-5","10.1109/DASC.2018.8569685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569685","DIMA;IMA;ARINC653;system management;Flexible Platform;lab demonstrator;high lift system;platform-based development;Selective Middleware approach","Aerospace electronics;Aircraft;Computer architecture;Hardware;Middleware;Redundancy","aircraft;avionics;certification","safety-critical system functions;complex system management;redundancy management;certification;hosted system function;system management functions;lab demonstrator;selective integration;distributed integrated modular avionics architectures;Institute of Aircraft Systems;flexible platform approach;fault detection;ILS;University of Stuttgart;ARINC653 applications;industrial IMA modules;DIMA architecture","","3","","46","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Uniform plasmas are essential for plasma processing, because the distribution of the plasma density is directly related to the processing uniformity. In order to reduce the inductance of an antenna and generate uniform plasma, a parallel antenna is used. However, even if the parallel is used, high uniformity of the plasma density cannot be achieved. This is because larger currents flow to the inner coil than to the outer coil. In this study, a LC parallel circuit is added to the inner coil to control the current flowing through the inner coil. By adjusting the capacitance of the LC parallel circuit, the radial distribution of the plasma density can be controlled.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575195","","Inductance;Conferences;Capacitors;Capacitance;Plasma density;Plasma sources;Antennas","antennas in plasma;plasma density;plasma materials processing;plasma sources","plasma density distribution;parallel variable capacitor;inductively coupled plasma;nonuniform distribution;antenna inductance;plasma processing;processing uniformity;parallel antenna;LC parallel circuit;plasma source","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While these programs are diverse, many share a core need for a small, robust pulsed neutron generator. This project addresses this need by building a portable dense plasma focus (DPF) neutron source. DPF technology offers many benefits that are infeasible using conventional neutron sources: it can generate intense neutron pulses, operate at relatively low voltage, and be scaled to a lightweight form factor. Large-scale DPF sources produce prolific neutron radiation but require heavy machinery for transport and are therefore not ideal for mobile applications. Alternatively, compact DPF systems can be fabricated that are easily transported by human operators and generate sufficient neutron output to accomplish mobile active interrogation missions. Recently, researchers at Mission Support and Test Services (MSTS) have constructed a bench-top DPF system to produce neutron radiation. The system comprises commercially available high voltage power supplies, capacitors, and cold-cathode thyratron switches and weighs approximately 25 kg. The system draws approximately 750 Wand can be powered using lithium-ion battery packs. A custom plasma process chamber was designed using hybrid PIC-MHD modeling software and constructed using off-the-shelf components. A control system was implemented on a microcontroller platform to discharge the DPF source with a repetition rate up to 0.2 Hz. A suite of neutron yield and time-of- flight diagnostics was used to measure the radiation output of the portable DPF source.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575643","U.S. Department of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575643","","Power supplies;Microcontrollers;Rectifiers;Neutrons;Plasma measurements;Software;Plasmas","microcontrollers;national security;neutron sources;plasma focus;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation;thyratrons","portable dense plasma focus neutron source;active interrogation applications;special nuclear materials;national security programs;Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation agencies;robust pulsed neutron generator;DPF technology;conventional neutron sources;intense neutron pulses;relatively low voltage;lightweight form factor;DPF sources;prolific neutron radiation;mobile applications;compact DPF systems;sufficient neutron output;mobile active interrogation missions;bench-top DPF system;cold-cathode thyratron switches;custom plasma process chamber;neutron yield;time-of- flight diagnostics;portable DPF source;frequency 0.2 Hz","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPECVD) is one of the commonly used methods in the microwave plasma systems. In this work, the design and development of a MPECVD system operated at a resonant frequency of 2.45 GHz have been conducted using numerical modeling based on the finite element method (FEM) and conformal finite difference time domain particle-in-cell (CFDTD PIC) simulation. With the numerical modeling, the MPECVD system could be designed and optimized to achieve a high efficiency coupling of microwave into the inner reaction chamber. Based on the design, the MPECVD system has been constructed and successfully employed for growing diamond films.

These electrons, which can originate from the solar wind or a high-altitude nuclear explosion, have the potential to damage satellites in low-Earth orbit. For example, in 1962, the US detonated the Starfish warhead at an altitude of about 400 km. The unexpected resulting enhancement of the radiation belts disabled several satellites within a few months and energetic electrons remained in the radiation belts for up to several years. In order to address this potential vulnerability, schemes have been proposed to drain electrons from the radiation belts, with the most promising based on using high-power very-low frequency (VLF) waves to change the transverse energy of the electrons, allowing them to precipitate into the Earth's atmosphere. This talk will provide an overview of the radiation belts and their electron distribution as well as approaches to VLF wave belt remediation including the use of either antennas or relativistic electrons beams in space to generate the VLF waves.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575991","","Space vehicles;Electric potential;US Department of Energy;Ionizing radiation;Satellites;Space radiation;Orbits","artificial satellites;nuclear explosions;radiation belts;relativistic electron beams","radiation belt remediation;space-based antennas;electron beams;relativistic electrons;Van Allen Belts;high-altitude nuclear explosion;low-Earth orbit;radiation belts disabled;energetic electrons;high-power very-low frequency waves;electron distribution;VLF wave belt remediation;size 400.0 km","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A New Method to Generate Strong Underwater Shock Waves Using Water Electrolysis in Negative Streamer Pulsed Spark Discharge","K. Lee; K. -J. Chung; Y. S. Hwang","Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","2018 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)","1 Nov 2021","2018","","","1","1","In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve an energy efficiency in development of strong shock wave by using underwater pulsed spark discharges. By preconditioning a water-gap via water electrolysis, hydrogen microbubbles are produced at a cathode, and drift towards the anode during the preconditioning phase. A negatively enhanced electrode pair is adopted to initiate the negative (anode-directed) streamer in the presence of microbubbles near the cathode tip. When a high-voltage pulse is applied to the water-gap just after the end of the preconditioning phase, the overall pre-breakdown process is observed to be remarkably accelerated. Since the reaction rate of the electrolysis depends on the experimental conditions such as water conductivity, hydrostatic pressure, structure of water-gap, and amplitude of preconditioning pulse, it is found that there is an optimum preconditioning duration in terms of energy efficiency for the shock wave generation. More interestingly, it is experimentally demonstrated that the morphology of the underwater streamer significantly influences on the development of shock waves. In particular, the tree-like structure of the negative subsonic streamers is much more advantageous than the volcano-like structure of the conventional positive (cathode-directed) subsonic streamers. That is, it is clearly shown that this technique overcomes the biggest drawback of negative subsonic discharges, i.e. the slow vapor bubble formation due to screening effect, and thus provides a new way to improve the efficiency of shock wave generation by pulsed spark discharges in water. Here, we elucidate the working principle of this technique, and discuss some engineering issues associated with the environmental factors.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575821","National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575821","","Shock waves;Hydrogen;Morphology;Energy efficiency;Environmental factors;Plasmas;Sparks","bubbles;discharges (electric);electrochemical electrodes;electrolysis;shock waves;sparks;water","water conductivity;water-gap;shock wave generation;negative subsonic streamers;positive subsonic streamers;water electrolysis;negative streamer pulsed spark discharge;underwater pulsed spark discharges;hydrogen microbubbles;negatively enhanced electrode pair;cathode tip;high-voltage pulse;reaction rate;hydrostatic pressure;morphology;tree-like structure;volcano-like structure;H2O","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conical wire array is composed by 16 equally spaced tungsten (W) wires of 25 $\mu \mathrm{m}$ each used as load of the pulsed power driver. Also, the conical array dynamics is monitored using UV/XUV imaging of the self-emission of the plasma in the side-on direction. The experiments are performed in the Llampudken1 generator which delivers ~ 350 kA in~ 350 ns at different background pressures. Results indicate axial emission of MeV ions regardless the background pressure. Since different background pressures have different mean free paths for neutral-ion collisions, these energetic ions are able to interact with the background gas producing the ionization of it at pressures above 10–4 Torr. This ionization is measured by the detection of electrons preceding the ions signals on the Faraday cups. According to time-of-flight measurements the emission of these ions is made during the ablation phase of the conical wire array. In addition, some experiments include a transverse electric field in the path where the particles are propagating. These experiments indicate different ionic species in the particle outflow with ionization higher than five. When comparing these observations with the dynamics observed with UV /XUV imaging, it can be suggested that the ions and the dense jet are different phenomena. The observation of fast outflow of particles from a conical wire array and possible ejection mechanisms will be shown and discussed.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575290","","Phased arrays;Phase measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Wires;Ionization;Tungsten;Imaging","plasma simulation;plasma X-ray sources;tungsten;Z pinch","particle emission;tungsten conical wire array;Faraday cups;conical array dynamics;axial emission;background pressure;mean free paths;neutral-ion collisions","","","","1","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Similarity of the gas discharge enables us to extrapolate features of discharges, for which the experimental studies may not be feasible or even possible. However, the validity of the similarity law is not entirely confirmed on various discharge conditions. In this paper, several recent studies on the similarities of the low-temperature plasma discharges will be presented, based on both experiments and numerical simulations. (i) The classical Paschen's law was extended to discharge gaps with different aspect ratios, and the breakdown voltage $U_{\mathrm{b}}$ was identified as a function of the reduced gap length pd and the aspect ratio d/r, i.e., $U_{\mathrm{b}}=f(pd,d/r)$. Here. $p$ is the pressure, $d$ the gap length, and $r$ is the discharge radius This formula can be explained by the transverse diffusion of the charged particles and the uniformity of the electric field. (ii) The voltage-current characteristics are used to identify the similar discharges. Meanwhile, the effects of the scaling factor and the gas pressure on the validity of similarity law are investigated. The similarity relation holds in a certain pressure range and for limited scaling factors. (iii) The similarity relation for the cathode fall thickness in glow discharges is confirmed by using the light emission distribution in geometrically similar gaps. (iv) Based on the numerical model (fluid model and global model), the effect of nonlinear processes (such as stepwise ionizations and three-body collisions) on the glow discharge similarity law is studied in gaps with different scaling factors2. Finally, several applications of the similarity law are given, including large glow discharges, e.g. for cleaning ITER; extra-small discharge, e.g. microdischarges in analytical chemistry, and the discharge in ultra-large dimension in the atmosphere.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575324","","Partial discharges;Fluids;Conferences;Ionization;Low-temperature plasmas;Numerical simulation;Discharges (electric)","argon;cathodes;glow discharges;numerical analysis;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes","low-temperature plasma discharges;gas discharge;discharge conditions;classical Paschen law;discharge gaps;scaling factor;glow discharge similarity law","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exposure to a nonuniform field is a well-studied cause for this difficulty encountered in numerous applications. There are, however, some less-understood causes, which are inherent in nature in that they persist even in a perfectly uniform field. We present an experimental study on three main inherent causes with rice grains as samples. Of these cause, somewhat less obvious is the polarization charge shielding effect1 2. Exposed to the wave electric field, electrical charges in the dielectric object react in a way to partially shield the wave electric field. As a result, the dielectric object's interior electric field can be significantly smaller than the incident electric field, resulting in a much reduced power deposition. Experiments are conducted in an applicator, in which samples are irradiated by a 24 GHz microwave. High radiation uniformity (~99%) and polarization control allow a quantitative examination of each cause. Their individual and collective effects are found to be highly significant. In particular, polarization-charge shielding alone can result in a temperature spread of~ 18.2% for the samples examined. Physical interpretations are given and an effective method for its mitigation is demonstrated.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575835","","Radio frequency;Microwave integrated circuits;Electromagnetic heating;Microwave technology;Conferences;Dielectrics;Plasmas","electromagnetic shielding;microwave heating","dielectric object;wave electric field;incident electric field;reduced power deposition;polarization control;particular charge;polarization-charge;temperature spread;nonuniform microwave heating;excessive temperature;uneven energy deposition;nonuniform field;less-understood causes;perfectly uniform field;polarization charge;electrical charges;dielectric objects;polarization charge shielding effect;frequency 24.0 GHz","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This results in the material being volumetrically heated to depths two orders of magnitude greater than the skin depth of the material, creating a large volume, ultrahigh energy density $(> 10^{9}\text{Jcm}^{-3})$ plasma1. Time integrated spectroscopic measurements of Au and Ni nanowire plasmas at an intensity of $5\mathrm{x}10^{18}\text{Wcm}^{-2}(\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{o}}=1)$ demonstrated the creation of multi- keV, near solid density plasmas ionized to the Au $52+$ and $\text{Ni}^{26+}$ charge states2. The radiative lifetime of these plasmas is significantly decreased due to their high electron density while their hydrodynamic expansion time is greatly increased due to their large size. The result is a large increase in the conversion of the optical laser light into hv > 1keV x-rays. Previously, the conversion efficiency has been shown to exceed 20% into 4 pi steradians when irradiating 80nm diameter, 12% of solid density, Au nanowires at an intensity of $4\mathrm{x}10^{19}\text{Wcm}^{-2\ 3}$.

Many diagnostic technologies have been developed such as Langmuir probe and Laser Thomson Scattering (LTS). However, Langmuir probe has a size limit to avoid changing the plasma, but the tiny probe is thus not strong enough and in risk to survive the current impact. LTS requires multiple pulses to avoid a dilemma of weak signal1 or heating the plasma2, especially for a low ionization degree situation. However, the multiple-pulse method requires or assumes that the plasma has no significant change during the measurement3. Therefore, we provide a supplemental method for electron temperature estimation. In the continuity equation of electron, the temporal derivative of electron density consists of diffusion current, drift current, and electron gain/loss events, such as ionizations, recombination, and attachments. The diffusion, drift and the rate coefficients of those events are functions of electron temperature and reduced electric field, while the temporal profile of electron density can be measured by Rayleigh scattering. Therefore, along with the electric field measured or estimated, the only unknown in the equation is the average electron temperature which can be solved numerically. An example of microwave scattering on cold atmospheric plasma jet4 is included for the demonstration. The plasma jet has an electron density around 1012 cm-3 and keeps varying during its warm-up process.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575270","NSF(grant numbers:#465061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575270","","Temperature measurement;Rayleigh scattering;Atmospheric measurements;Current measurement;Ionization;Scattering;Plasma measurements","electric field measurement;electron density;Langmuir probes;plasma collision processes;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma jets;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes;Rayleigh scattering","laser Thomson scattering;Langmuir probe;tiny probe;current impact;multiple pulses;low ionization degree situation;multiple-pulse method;electron density;diffusion current;electric field;Rayleigh scattering;microwave scattering;cold atmospheric plasma jet;electron temperature estimation;thermal nonequilibrium cases;diagnostic technologies;size 1012.0 cm","","","","4","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, even though extensive studies are available in the literature, still there exists a lack of knowledge about when and where the molecules are formed in a transient plasma system like a LPP. Typically, the molecular emissions are observed when the plasma has cooled and undergone significant expansion into the ambient atmosphere, and molecular emission persist for longer periods compared to the excited atomic and ionic emissions.

For attaining greater control over the deposition and processing of materials, the appropriate ion energies and ion flux and the control over plasma dynamics need to be achieved to make this process reliable and repeatable. One of the main parameter to achieve this control is the electrode dimensions, operating gas pressure, and gas mixture ratio in plasma focus device. We kept the operating voltages same. For example, to limit the amount of material deposited, it might be necessary to dilute the reactive gaseous environment with inert gases like He, N e or Ar. The dilution/mixture can affect the pinch dynamics inside the plasma focus device. In the present study, we report the use of different diagnostics, such as electrical probes and fast-gated imaging, to understand the pinch and post pinch plasma dynamics under methane gas operation mixed with neon and argon gases. In order to increase the pinch plasma volume for more material synthesis the experiments were also performed with modified plasma focus device with larger diameter anode.

A Mini-Circuits ZX95-2920CA+ VCO is used as the signal generator with low phase noise and modulation capable with a bandwidth of 55 MHz. An inline attenuator provides the operator power control in the range of approximately 42 to 64 dBm (16 to 2800 W). A high-speed RF switch creates a 100-microsecond pulse with a rise time of 25 ns and a typical switching time of 35 ns.

In order to investigate the working range of the so called “hollow cathode effect”, the experiments of low-pressure $(20\text{Pa}\leq p\leq 800\text{Pa})$ hollow cathode discharges were carried out between a plane anode and a cathode made of stainless steel with a cylindrical cavity. The diameter $D$ and depth $h$ of the cavity were 2cm and 4cm respectively. Argon was chosen as the working gas. The voltage-current characteristic curves of the hollow cathode discharges under different gas pressure $p$ were obtained. It is found that the lower boundary of working range of the hollow cathode effect in our experiment is $p\cdot D\approx 2p\cdot d_{n}$ where $d_{n}$ is the cathode layer thickness of normal glow discharge. This means that for the optimal operation of HCDs, the cavity in the cathode should be small just enough to house two opposing glow discharges, i.e., $D\approx 2d_{n}$. The value of $d_{n}$ is important. In order to determine the cathode layer thickness $d_{n}$ in the normal glow discharge, the computational method based on the iteration and the experimental method with a Langmuir probe were used in this paper. The upper boundary of the working range is that $p\cdot D$ is about several Torr.cm, less than 10 Torr.cm in general. Compared with glow discharges between parallel-plane electrodes, current density will increase largely in the hollow cathode discharges when the hollow cathode effect occurs, leading to a great increasing of the operating range of the discharge current. The similarity law of hollow cathode discharges and its physical mechanism between two similar hollow cathode discharge gaps were also studied in this paper.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575257","National Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:51777114); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575257","","Conferences;Discharges (electric);Plasmas;Steel;Argon;Probes;Current density","argon;cathodes;current density;glow discharges;Langmuir probes;plasma temperature","microhollow cathode discharges;hollow cathode effect;cathode layer thickness;glow discharge;hollow cathode discharge gaps","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, we explore the influence of the quenching coefficient for the singlet metastable $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{a}^{1}\Delta_{\mathrm{g}})$ on the electrode surface. At a low driving frequency and low pressure (5 and 10 mTorr), a combination of stochastic ($\alpha$ -mode) and drift ambipolar (DA) heating in the bulk plasma (the electronegative core) is observed and the DA-mode dominates the time averaged electron heating [1]. As the driving frequency or pressure are increased, the heating mode transitions into a pure a-mode, where electron heating in the sheath region dominates. At low pressure (5 and 10 mTorr), this transition coincides with a sharp decrease in electronegativity [1]. At low pressure and low driving frequency, the EEPF is concave [2]. As the driving frequency is increased, the number of low energy electrons increases and the relative number of higher energy electrons (> 10 e V) increases. The surface quenching coefficient has a significant influence on the density of the singlet metastable $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{a}^{1}\Delta_{\mathrm{g}})$ and thus the discharge electronegativity and electron heating mechanisms.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575703","","Heating systems;Electrodes;Time-frequency analysis;Oxygen;Monte Carlo methods;Surface discharges;Conferences","discharges (electric);electronegativity;high-frequency discharges;Langmuir probes;Monte Carlo methods;oxygen;plasma collision processes;plasma density;plasma heating;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes","capacitively coupled oxygen discharges;one-dimensional object-oriented particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision code oopd;charged particle density profiles;electron heating mechanism;electron energy probability function;ion energy distribution;single frequency capacitively coupled oxygen discharge;singlet metastable;low driving frequency;ambipolar heating;bulk plasma;heating mode transitions;low energy electrons increases;higher energy electrons;surface quenching coefficient;discharge electronegativity;sheath region;frequency 12.0 MHz to 100.0 MHz;pressure 10.0 mtorr;O2","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regarding CO2 as a potentially renewable carbon source and converting it into value added fuels and chemicals offers a promising route for CO2 reutilization while significantly inhibiting carbon emissions. There have been interest in plasma-assisted CO2 conversion using different non-thermal plasmas due to its non-equilibrium character, low energy cost and unique ability to initiate both physical and chemical reactions at low temperatures1–3.

F or example, avoiding the predicted onset windows requires reliable a priori knowledge of the surface secondary emission yield (SEY). However, the materials' SEY data reported in the literature can vary, as it is difficult to obtain exactly repeatable SEY results. SEY can be affected by real surface conditions such as defects, adsorbed species and other deviations from a perfect, clean state. Moreover, SEY dependence upon primary impact angle and secondary emission energy are frequently neglected in predictive multipactor models1. Additionally, the vacuum environment has a non-negligible impact, yet these initial conditions are not always fully characterized3, To approach this problem under well-characterized conditions and in a controlled, repeatable manner, we are designing and building a full experimental suite to initiate and study two surface multipactor, and its suppression, in a microstrip transmission line.

For optimal cooling it is essential that space charge be sufficiently neutralized such that the magnetized electron trajectories along the magnetic field lines are not disturbed.

An unphysical particle boundary condition, i.e., large initial thermal velocities of electrons, had to be assumed although we were able to produce the LFO in the 3-D electromagnetic (EM) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. In this work, we have included the gyrotron cavity along with the MIG as well as a large vacuum envelope representing the vacuum chamber similar to that employed in the MIT experiments and measurement. In the EM PIC simulation, it is found that the momentum of electrons is suppressed by the space charge due to the vacuum envelope used in the simulations. It is suspected the space charge effect in the large vacuum envelope on the gyro-electron beam causes the LFOs. We have employed a larger scale simulation to verify this hypothesis. For the first time, without unphysical approximations, the LFO could be reproduced in the 3D time domain EM PIC simulations. The initial velocity spread at the cathode temperature is assumed in this simulation in contrast to an unphysical larger velocity spread formerly used. So, it is found that the LFOs observed in the MIT gyrotron experiments are possibly caused by the combing effects of initial thermal spread and space charge suppression the spent beam encountered after finishing the cavity interaction due to transition to the larger vacuum chamber used in the experiment.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575924","Hanyang University(grant numbers:HY-201400000002393); NERSC; DOE Office of Science User Facility of USA(grant numbers:DE-AC02-05CH11231); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575924","","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Gyrotrons;Magnetic domains;Space charge;Plasmas;Electromagnetics","cathodes;electron beams;gyrotrons;magnetrons;space charge","space charge effect;vacuum envelope;gyro-electron beam;larger scale simulation;LFO;initial velocity;unphysical larger velocity;MIT gyrotron experiments;initial thermal spread;larger vacuum chamber;low-frequency oscillation;magnetic compression profile;magnetron injection gun;MIG;MIT fusion gyrotron;unphysical particle boundary condition;gyrotron cavity;EM PIC simulation;3D electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulation study;cathode temperature","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The laser enters the pressurized fuel region through a thin laser entrance window (LEW). The LEW contains the pressurized fuel inside of the liner until the few-ns preheating laser pulse is applied, which ablates the LEW and preheats the fuel. Energy losses are thought to occur at the laser entrance window (LEW) as a result of laser-plasma interactions (LPI). Additionally, simulations are presently unable to reliably model the LPI losses.1 To reduce energy losses and computational uncertainties, the LEW could be weakened and removed very early in time, well before the preheating laser pulse arrives at the LEW.2 This general concept of removing the LEW very early in time is referred to as “Laser Gate.”2 One proposed implementation of Laser Gate, which we are working on at the University of Michigan, is to break the LEW very early in time by driving an electrical current through a thin wire that is wrapped around the perimeter of the LEW.2 The electrical current heats and melts the perimeter of the LEW, allowing the fuel pressure to push open the LEW. As the LEW is broken, it opens away from the contained fuel and out of the laser path. Before a significant amount of fuel has time to escape the liner, the preheating laser pulse is applied. Doing this successfully should reduce fuel-window mixing and LPI in MagLIF. For our experiments at UM, the pulsed electrical current is driven through the thin wire by a 13-kV mini-pulser. Additionally, a laser backlighting system is being developed to image the dynamics of the LEW as it opens. We will report on our first experimental tests of this implementation of Laser Gate.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575998","","Laser theory;Energy loss;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Wires;Logic gates;Laser modes","fusion reactor design;fusion reactor fuel;fusion reactor ignition;fusion reactor instrumentation;fusion reactor targets;plasma diagnostics;plasma simulation;pulse generators;pulsed power supplies","magnetized liner inertial fusion;pressurized fuel region;laser entrance window;laser-plasma interactions;preheating laser pulse;laser gate experiment","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This had prevented any use of THz radiation particularly useful in spectroscopy since vibrational modes of molecules are involved in the THz range. THz spectroscopy provides therefore unique fingerprints of material of great interest (e.g. explosives, pharmaceuticals, drugs …) for security and medical applications. Since the emerging of femtosecond pulsed lasers, this gap has been filling by scientists and industrials. Time resolved spectroscopy setups historically used in THz range 1 take advantage of non-linear effects in crystals and semiconductors to generate and detect THz using laser pulse. Such techniques provide picosecond electromagnetic bursts whose spectrum are limited and spread typically from 0.1 THz to few THz. Indeed, photoconductive antennas based on semiconductors have limited bandwidths due to photo-carrier lifetime, while electro-optic (EO) crystals absorb a part of the generated THz leading to dips in the available THz spectrum. The use of diluted media as gases could therefore leads to larger bandwidth. The first solution was proposed by Dai et al.2 who used plasma as a centro-symmetric nonlinear media for broadband THz generation and detection. This technique offers the possibility to get THz waves 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more powerful than classical methods. It also gives the possibility to get a very broadband spectrum, from 0.1 THz to several tens of THz. To generate such broadband THz radiation, a high power femtosecond laser pulse is focalized in air until breakdown is reached: a plasma is generated. The electrons produced by this ionization process are accelerated by an intense optical field asymmetry. This asymmetry is enhanced by using part of the optical pulse whose frequency was previously doubled in a non-linear crystal. The same principle is used to detect the THz signal. In this configuration, the plasma acts as a non linear medium where a four wave mixing occurs: 2 photons from the optical pulse at pulsation ω and 1 THz photon mix to generate a photon at pulsation 2ω whose intensity is directly proportional to THz signal intensity. The authors will present during the conference, short THz waveforms and their associated broadband spectrum generated and detected by air plasma techniques, and their dependence on the experimental parameters.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575659","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575659","","Spectroscopy;Semiconductor lasers;Crystals;Media;Plasmas;Broadband communication;Ultrafast optics","antennas;carrier lifetime;electro-optical effects;nonlinear media;nonlinear optics;optical pulse generation;photoconducting devices;photoionisation;plasma diagnostics;plasma production by laser;terahertz wave detectors;terahertz wave generation;terahertz wave spectra;time resolved spectra;vibrational modes","optical field asymmetry;ionization process;broadband THz detection;centro-symmetric nonlinear media;diluted media;electro-optic crystals;photocarrier lifetime;photoconductive antennas;picosecond electromagnetic bursts;time resolved spectroscopy;vibrational modes;laser induced plasma;THz waveforms;THz signal intensity;optical pulse;high power femtosecond laser pulse;broadband THz radiation;THz spectrum;THz spectroscopy;terahertz gap;terahertz pulse generation;frequency 0.1 THz;frequency 1.0 THz","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transport distance and transport efficiency of charged particles are the crucial evaluation indexes. For the vortex rings produced by a piston/ cylinder installation, the transport distance is closely related to Reynolds number and Formation number (the ratio of piston stroke and piston diameter, dimensionless). Based on the k-omega turbulence model, this paper studies the relationship of transport distance and formation number of vortex rings by using the finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics, and find the optimal formation number, when the transport distance, transport efficiency and maximum transport velocity are simultaneously maximum. The results show that, the optimal formation number is between 0.8 and 1.3, when the Reynolds number at the export of device is about 10,000.

An LaB6 hot cathode is installed on one end of the chamber, emitting energetic electrons whose energy can be varied up to approximately 200eV. The base pressure is ~ 1 0–6 Torr, and Ar, He, or mixed H2 DC glow discharge plasmas are generated with working pressure of between 0.1 and 10.0mTorr.

Additional biological effects due to the plasma-generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are also possible. In this work, atmospheric pressure plasmas were used to treat seeds and water. In the direct seed treatment, discharges were sustained in a packed bed reactor (PBR) in which seed aggregate acts as the packing material. The PBR was also set up in two dimensions to allow optical access to study discharge propagation through the matrix of seeds. The discharge was formed using nanosecond, high voltage pulses, and various feedstock gases to assess sensitivity to the production of RONS. Characterization of reactants and their effects were investigated using a fast-camera and spectroscopy setup on the $2\mathrm{d}$ apparatus. Contact angle measurements were also performed on the plasma treated seeds. In the indirect treatment, water was exposed to DBD-type plasmas. Hydrogen peroxide, nitrate and nitrite concentration along with pH of the treated water were measured as a function of operating condition. The associated effects on seeds were quantified as a function of the relative densities of these species.

Inclusion of the space-charge effects allowed investigation of a saturation mechanism driven by electron diffusion. Fluid equations for the electron motion were used to derive a criteria that governs electron diffusion, and allowed estimation of the steady-state electron density in a typical multipactor discharge. It was found that the steady state density scaled with the RF voltage when that voltage was close to the multipactor threshold, then became insensitive to any further voltage increases due to the saturation in the effective secondary electron yield. Furthermore, it was found that in the presence of magnetic field electrons may be trapped by executing a slow rigid-rotor rotation, as described by the Brillouin condition.

Thus, new energy efficient and high yield ammonia production methods are of great interest. According to Le Chatelier 's principle, ammonia production requires low temperature and high pressure conditions [2]. Non-thermal plasma creates an ideal high-energy environment necessary to break nitrogen and hydrogen molecules to produce ammonia. However, maintaining a low temperature non-thermal plasma of useful volume at high pressure is exceedingly difficult. Common power supplies are unable to deliver the energy necessary to sustain a non-thermal plasma above atmospheric pressure. Therefore, this study required the use of a homemade high voltage double polarity nanosecond-pulsed power supply to sustain a non-thermal plasma at high pressure. The highvoltage pulses were delivered simultaneously at nanosecond intervals, therefore preventing the streamer-to-spark transition and favoring low temperature conditions.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575897","","Ammonia;Power supplies;Hydrogen;Production;High-voltage techniques;Energy efficiency;Plasmas","ammonia;discharges (electric);energy conservation;energy consumption;hydrogen;nitrogen;plasma applications;plasma chemistry;plasma diagnostics;plasma materials processing;pulsed power supplies;sparks","low temperature nonthermal plasma;atmospheric pressure;homemade high voltage double polarity nanosecond-pulsed power supply;favoring low temperature conditions;pulsed nanosecond high-pressure nitrogen discharge;essential precursor;Haber-Bosch process;annual global energy consumption;high yield ammonia production methods;Le Chatelier;high pressure conditions;high-energy environment;hydrogen molecules;pressure 1.0 atm","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In past decades, it has been considered as an impossible mission to simulate a fusion gyrotron in 3-D using a PIC based method. The preliminary results showed that the 3 - D electromagnetic PIC method could provide an alternative modeling tool for studying the gyrotron cavity interaction and mode competition for gaining more physics insight and further improving the efficiency. It had been demonstrated that a full wave simulation on 110 GHz TE22,6 mode gyrotron for a run time of 100 ns can be completed within a wall time of 48 h using 256 CPU cores. Upon finishing the code development, a research effort has been continued in recent years to study the beam wave interaction and mode competition using the well-developed 3-D electromagnetic PIC simulation. More production runs have been performed to understand the operation characteristics of the fusion gyrotron. The output power and mode switching have been determined quantitatively when varying the applied magnetic field.

The structure of pulse generator is required to maintain its insulation strength under repetitive pulses (RP). Previous researches have shown that the flashover voltage of insulators under RP are extremely lower than those under single pulse (SP). Moreover, the surface flashover occurs after several pulses and the flashover voltage under RP nonlinearly depends on the repetitive rate. Traditionally, the performance of an insulator under RP is usually characterized by the total number of applied pulses $N\text{fl}$ and the withstanding time $T\text{fl}$ before flashover. However, $N\text{fl}$ and $T\text{fl}$ are parameters only reflecting the lifetime of an insulator under a specific working condition. The development of surface insulation strength in the withstanding stage and its influential factors are crucial for the determination of the insulation capability and comprehension of the mechanism of surface flashover under RP. In this paper, the concept of the residual surface insulation strength is proposed to reflect the development of surface insulation strength in the withstanding stage, defined as the instantaneous surface flashover voltage $U_{\text{res}}$ with RP continuously applied. $U_{\text{res}}$ and its influential factors are investigated including the repetitive frequency, applied voltage amplitude and surface distance.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575824","","Pulse generation;Employee welfare;Conferences;Voltage;High-voltage techniques;Flashover;Insulators","flashover;insulators;pulse generators;surface discharges","residual surface insulation strength;repetitive high voltage nanosecond pulse generators;pulse generator;insulator;repetitive rate;withstanding stage;insulation capability;repetitive frequency;voltage amplitude;surface distance;withstanding time;instantaneous surface flashover voltage","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, the somewhat broadband nature of the NLTL pulse translates into a saw-tooth profile for the peak frequency of the electron beam as a function of axial distance down the drift tube. Most importantly, the direct relation between applied voltage and cathode current emission leads to in phase bunching in both current and velocity, which enhances the maximum bunching amplitude when compared to just voltage modulation.

We study the effects on jet dynamics resulting from varying an applied uniform axial magnetic field (Bz) from 0 to 2 T. We empirically observe a disruption of the plasma jet collimation, for which plasma is ej ected from the foil as discrete bursts and does not form an azimuthally symmetric plasma jet. The critical Bz for the disruption depends upon the foil material (Al, Ti, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, W). The disruption initiates from the foil surface and is dependent upon material properties such as electrical conductivity and equation of state. The applied Bz acts with the higher conductivity materials to facilitate nonuniform plasma and current filamentation that breaks the azimuthal symmetry needed to form the plasma jet. The plasma filamentation likely originates from initial perturbations (in density and resistivity) in the higher-density solid-liquid phases. 3D numerical simulations in Cartesian coordinates (using the extended magnetohydrodynamics code, PERSEUS) of a section of the ablating foil reproduce some of the experimental trends including the external magnetic field dependence and material resistivity dependence of the generation of plasma and current nonuniformities.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575133","National Nuclear Security Administration; Department of Energy (DOE)(grant numbers:DE-NA0001836,DE-NA0003764); National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:PHY-1102471); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575133","","Plasma jets;Three-dimensional displays;Perturbation methods;Conductivity;Numerical simulation;Nickel;Mathematical models","aluminium;astrophysical jets;copper;electrical conductivity;magnetic field effects;molybdenum;nickel;numerical analysis;plasma diagnostics;plasma instability;plasma jets;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;titanium;tungsten;Z pinch;zinc","thin disk;pulsed power generator;jet dynamics;applied uniform axial magnetic field;plasma jet collimation;azimuthally symmetric plasma jet;foil material;foil surface;material properties;electrical conductivity;equation of state;higher conductivity materials;nonuniform plasma;current filamentation;plasma filamentation;higher-density solid-liquid phases;external magnetic field dependence;material resistivity dependence;external magnetic field effects;foil ablation;plasma jet disruption;radial foil;Joule heating;density solid-liquid phase;initial perturbations;3D numerical simulations;extended magnetohydrodynamics code;time 100.0 ns;size 15.0 mum;current 1.0 MA;Ti;Ni;Cu;Zn;Mo;Al;W","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A coaxial double dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor driven by nanosecond (ns) power supply has been developed for plasma exhaust gas treatment. The glass, quartz, PC and PTFE materials are used as dielectric barriers of the coaxial DBD reactor to investigate their influence on discharge characteristics. The effects of these dielectric materials on the discharge uniformity, power depositions, energy efficiency, and reactor operation temperature are investigated through electric and optical diagnosis. The mechanisms of the influence of the dielectric materials on the DBD characteristics are analyzed by an equivalent electrical model and a heat conduct model. The results show that the discharge power of the ns pulsed coaxial DBD is larger with the larger relative permittivity of the dielectric material. Compared with the other dielectric materials at the same applied voltage, the ns pulsed coaxial DBD with glass dielectric barrier is more homogeneous and has higher energy efficiency which can reach 70.8% at 24 kV peak applied voltage with the analysis of equivalent electrical model. After 900 s operation at 24 kV, the coaxial DBD reactor with glass dielectric barrier has highest outside wall temperature of 78.0 °C. While, the reactor with PTFE dielectric barrier has lowest outside wall temperature of 58.2 °C. With the analysis of the equivalent electrical model and the heat conduct model, it is found that the energy loss of the reactor is the heat loss, which leads to the temperature increase. The heat loss rate increase with the decrease of the permittivity of the dielectric material. The reported work provides important reference for the selection of dielectric materials of the ns pulsed coaxial DBD reactor and is significant for the optimization of the exhaust gas plasma treatment process and industrial application.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9576022","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51777091,51677083); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576022","","Analytical models;Dielectric materials;Glass;Voltage;Discharges (electric);Plasmas;Inductors","dielectric materials;dielectric-barrier discharges;heat conduction;permittivity;plasma diagnostics;plasma dielectric properties;plasma materials processing","dielectric material;DBD characteristics;coaxial double dielectric barrier discharge reactor;coaxial DBD reactor;equivalent electrical model;glass dielectric barrier;PTFE dielectric barrier;nanosecond power supply;power deposition;optical diagnosis;discharge power;permittivity;temperature 78.0 degC;temperature 58.2 degC;voltage 24.0 kV;time 900.0 s","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, double gap vircator with feedback structure in Ref [4] is investigated in MAGIC simulation environment by considering start time, frequency control and efficiency under the application of external signal. External signal is applied by injecting desired mode to modulating cavity from the location of plunger by removing the plunger. Modulating cavity is coupled to output waveguide via coupling window which yields feedback from output waveguide to modulating cavity in vircator [5]. Double gap vircator gives 162MW output power in a single main frequency in S band with power efficiency of 5.36% when 450kV gap voltage is applied. Cross sections are rectangular and generated mode is TE10. Coupling field strengths in modulating cavity for vircator without field injection is found and strength of the inj ected electric field signal is chosen as not to exceed that value. Firstly, signal with same frequency in initial case is inj ected. During the various levels of field injection, open and close cases for coupling window are examined separately. Oscillations start ~4ns earlier for signal injection cases and 209MW output power with efficiency of 6.51 %, includes injected field power, is observed as highest value. Then magnitude of external signal is fixed, S band is almost covered in the vircator output by inj ecting various frequency of external signals. Power drops in this coverage is observed as due to cavity field distribution on the beam center.

The breakdown mechanisms can be more complicated in microdischarge at atmospheric pressure, since the dimensions are sharply reduced, where the presence of surface protrusion on the electrode surface becomes important3, In this paper, by using a two-dimensional fluid model, breakdown voltages in microgaps are predicted based on the voltage-current (VI) characteristics. The obtained VI curve, which includes the dark discharge region, the Townsend discharge region and the subnormal glow region, identifies the breakdown voltage when the discharge current enters the subnormal region. The effects of the protrusion's size and aspect ratio on the breakdown voltage are compared. The results show that the protrusion's size has a more profound effect on the breakdown voltages than the aspect ratio. When the effective distance between the anode and cathode is fixed, the breakdown voltage has a minimum value as the aspect ratio increases. As the effective distance increases, the breakdown voltage with a surface protrusion increases faster than that without a protrusion, resulting in an intersection between the two curves. The current density distribution on the cathode surface and the effect of the micro gap aspect ratio on the breakdown voltage are also presented.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575903","","Fluids;Electric breakdown;Surface discharges;Atmospheric modeling;Conferences;Predictive models;Discharges (electric)","cathodes;current density;electric breakdown;electrodes;glow discharges;plasma transport processes;Townsend discharge","voltage-current characteristics;breakdown voltage;surface protrusion increases;gas breakdown phenomenon;Paschen law;microdischarge;atmospheric pressure;electrode surface;two-dimensional fluid model;voltage-current (VI) characteristics;dark discharge region;Townsend discharge region;subnormal glow region;current density distribution;pressure 1.0 atm","","","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SLPIC is useful when the simulation requires a kinetic treatment of fast particles (e.g. electrons) while the physics of interest occurs on the time-scale of slow particles (e.g. heavy ions). Implementation of SLPIC requires a speed limiting factor $\beta(v)$ to reduce the computational velocities $v_{s}$ of fast particles from their true velocities $v_{i}$ by $v_{s}=\beta(v_{i})v_{i}$. The particle positions are updated at each time-step using $v_{s}$ and then particle values are interpolated to the grid using the weights $w_{s} =\beta(v_{i})w_{j}$, where $w_{i}$ is the conventional macroparticle weight. A “speed limit” is imposed, for example by $\beta(v_{i})=v_{i}(v_{i}^{2}+v_{0}^{2})^{-1/_{2}}$, so that no particle exceeds vo, and thus with $\Delta x=\beta v\Delta t < v0\Delta t$, no particle will travel a distance greater than the cell length $\Delta x$ in a single time-step.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575539","","Limiting;Conferences;Computational modeling;Ions;Steady-state;Plasmas;Kinetic theory","interpolation;particle beam dynamics;particle beam injection;plasma kinetic theory;plasma simulation","particle positions;particle values;conventional macroparticle weight;speed limit;cell length;single time-step;steady-state detection;SLPIC;PIC simulation;speed-limited particle-in-cell method","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the shielding gas flows to leeward side in the case of the strong cross wind and the welding defect caused by the arc deflection occurs with the lateral gas. It is important that the preventing technology of arc deflection is developed. The arc deflection has not been elucidated quantitatively because the measurement of asymmetric temperature and the axial flow velocity distribution of arc is difficult at the only experiment. In order to prevent the arc deflection, the elucidation of heat transport affected by the arc shape is important using numerical analysis. Therefore, it is necessary that the asymmetric temperature distribution is quantified such as the arc deflection using 3 D rectangular coordinate system. In this study, the convective heat transfer to radial direction affected by the transverse magnetic field with the lateral gas in TIG arc welding was elucidated.

In the first stage of AutoMag, helical current flows in the AutoMag liner and produces a strong internal axial field (20 to 100 T) during a 5 kA/ns current prepulse that lasts 100 to 300 ns. In the second stage, the rapidly-rising main current pulse (200 kA/ns) induces a strong electric field in the liner that causes the insulating material to undergo dielectric breakdown. Lastly, after breakdown, the liner current reorients to be primarily axial and the liner implodes radially via the Lorentz force. AutoMag is designed to eliminate the need for the external coil system [3] that is used to premagnetize fusion fuel in Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF [4]) which impedes diagnostic access and necessitates use of a high inductance power feed that reduces current delivery to the liner. Experiments have been successfully executed on the Mykonos accelerator [5] to evaluate the magnetization and breakdown stages of AutoMag. Microscopic magnetic field probes (microBdots) measured magnetic field inside of the liner and an iCCD imager and fast photodiodes made spatially-resolved and temporally-resolved measurements, respectively, of optical plasma emission in the load region. Fields near 1 MG were measured in multiple experiments and plasma emission indicative of breakdown was observed for select liner designs. These experiments, the first of their kind, represent an advance in magneto-inertial fusion that will enable the design of a new class of MagLIF targets capable of reaching higher current delivered to the liner (better fuel compression) and higher magnetization fields inside of the fusion fuel (better thermal insulation). Success of the experiments on Mykonos has resulted in the design of Z Machine experiments (planned Spring 2018) to study the implosion stage of AutoMag.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575592","","Magnetic field measurement;Current measurement;Magnetization;Magnetic separation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Optical variables measurement;Plasma measurements","electric breakdown;explosions;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma inertial confinement;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;Z pinch","main current pulse;strong electric field;insulating material;liner current reorients;Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion;current delivery;temporally-resolved measurements;select liner designs;higher magnetization fields;fusion fuel;dielectric breakdown;metallic helical conductors;helical current flows;AutoMag liner;strong internal axial field;Megagauss-level magnetic field;auto-magnetizing liner experiments;microscopic magnetic field probes;iCCD imager;optical plasma emission;photodiodes;magnetization fields;magneto-inertial fusion;Z Machine experiments;time 100.0 ns to 300.0 ns","","","","5","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a plasma mimics an antenna conductor it guides a surface wave. A new approach to plasma antennas is to use them to make a controlled dynamic conducting path and improve antenna efficiency, which is poor for electrically short antennas. This approach requires blocking reflected currents in the time domain and requires fast switching, which translates to fast ionization and recombination in the plasma. The dynamic plasma antenna is divided into a series of segments, which can provide a conducting current path with the onset of a rapid pulsed plasma discharge and conversely can block a current path when the plasma is absent. For this concept, it is critical that surface waves propagate along the plasma sheath boundary in regions of high plasma density and do not propagate in regions of low density. Moreover, it is also important that the plasma electron density is changed as fast as possible. We perform Discontinuous Galerkin Particle-In-Cell (DG-PIC) simulation- of Argon plasma. DG-PIC is adapted for use on unstructured grids allowing for increased spatial resolution2. It yields solutions with smaller memory and computational requirements than possible with low-order FDTD methods on structured grids.

They are often observed in earth's magnetosphere, laboratory plasmas and in solar wind plasmas. Magnetosonic wave is a kind of fundamental mode in magnetized plasma which propagates in the perpendicular direction of external magnetic field. The term pair-ion is generally referred to a plasma containing oppositely charged ions with nearly the same mass. Electron-positron plasma is an example of pair plasma and such pair ion plasma exists in pulsar magnetosphere, neutron stars and active galactic nuclei. Rogue waves are highly energetic waves with large amplitudes and have a small possibility of appearing instantly. Rogue waves are studied from the rational solutions of nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). Keeping in view the importance of rogue waves, magneto sonic rogue waves in pair-ion plasma are investigated. As per our knowledge, no investigation for magneto sonic rogue waves in pure pair-ion plasma has been reported so far. Thus, it seems interesting to investigate the nonlinear magneto sonic rogue waves in such type of plasma. We have considered two dimensional nonlinear magneto sonic rogue waves propagating perpendicular to the applied magnetic field in pair ion plasma. Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) equation is obtained using reductive perturbation technique and on modulating KP equation, NLSE is derived. Various parameters such as strength of magnetic field, electron temperature etc, significantly modify the characteristics of rogue wave profile. Both first- and second- order magnetosonic rogue wave profiles are studied. The results of present study may be useful to understand insight physics of magneto sonic rogue waves in supernova explosions, star formation etc.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575609","Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575609","","Temperature;Schrodinger equation;Perturbation methods;Neutrons;Ions;Plasmas;Magnetic fields","astrophysical plasma;neutron stars;nonlinear equations;plasma ion acoustic waves;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma nonlinear waves;plasma solitons;plasma temperature;pulsars;Schrodinger equation","magnetosonic rogue waves;pair ion plasma;plasma heating;charged particle acceleration;laboratory plasmas;solar wind plasmas;magnetized plasma;electron-positron plasma;highly energetic waves;pure pair-ion plasma;rogue wave profile;second- order magnetosonic rogue wave profiles;magneto sonic wave propagation;neutron stars;active galactic nuclei;two-dimensional nonlinear magneto sonic rogue waves;KP equation;magnetic field strength;supernova explosions;star formation;nonlinear Schrodinger equation","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ability to calibrate the full system, including all fiber optic runs and probes is crucial to understanding errors in the calibration process. The calibration procedure involves imaging a blackbody light source, with a known spectral radiance which is coupled to an integrating sphere. This source is streaked slowly over a few ns using Sydor streak cameras.

Examples of common interfacial tissues found in the human body are cartilage-bone, tendon-bone and ligament-bone2, The regular occurrence of irreversible damage to these interfacial tissues as well as the lack of true integrative solutions makes interface tissue engineering a significant clinical challenge. In the last decade, intensive research has therefore been performed on the development of anisotropic scaffolds to tackle this issue. In this study, the possibility of non-thermal plasma-assisted deposition of a combination of coatings with a high anisotropic character onto 3D scaffolds is explored. To achieve this goal, a newly-designed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma system operating at medium pressure (50 kPa) was assembled that allowed for the simultaneous deposition of 2 coatings consisting either out of primary amines or carboxylic acid functionalities. An electrical characterization of the plasma was done to guarantee optimal conditions for coating deposition. Optical emission spectroscopy was employed to identify the radical species present in the plasma and how possible interactions between the different activated precursor species influenced the plasma gas composition. After 2D optimization, the coatings were deposited into 3D interporous scaffolds, which were fabricated from 300PEO-PEOT/PBT 55/45, a biodegradable copolymer that is known for its excellent mechanical properties, good biocompatibility and controllable degradation rate. The influence of discharge power, gas feed rates and monomer concentrations on the anisotropic character of the deposited coatings in the 3D microporous structures as well as their respective stability were analyzed using localized mapping techniques based on X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Finally, a series of in-vitro studies was performed using adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) and different fluorescent stains were used to identify differences in cell behavior according to their chemical surroundings.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575679","","Spectroscopy;Three-dimensional displays;Stimulated emission;Tissue engineering;Stem cells;Discharges (electric);Stability analysis","biodegradable materials;biomedical materials;bone;cellular biophysics;fluorescence;Fourier transform infrared spectra;plasma deposited coatings;plasma deposition;polymer blends;polymer films;porous materials;rapid prototyping (industrial);tissue engineering;X-ray photoelectron spectra","dielectric barrier discharge plasma system;coating deposition;plasma gas composition;3D interporous scaffolds;3D microporous structures;damaged tissue regeneration;anisotropic scaffolds;nonthermal plasma-assisted deposition;plasma-modified 3D additive manufactured scaffolds;cartilage-bone interfacial tissue engineering;ligament-bone interfacial tissues;tendon-bone interfacial tissues;primary amines;carboxylic acid functionalities;optical emission spectroscopy;300PEO-PEOT-PBT 55-45;biodegradable copolymer;biocompatibility;localized mapping;X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy;FTIR spectroscopy;adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells;fluorescent stains;pressure 50.0 kPa","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generation of these species is heavily dependent on the pulse parameters, including pulse width, pulse rise time and the energy per pulse. It has been reported that the majority of OH is generated during the rising and falling time of the pulse [1]. When using longer pulse durations (>200-ns), these events can be seen as separate OH generation events. But when a much shorter pulse duration is used (~ 10-ns), these events happen so close together that they overlap, affecting the plasma chemistry and energy deposition [2]. It is currently unknown if the pulse rise time has an effect on the production of OH at shorter pulse durations. Using a single needle electrode, a helium plasma jet was generated in air using a 10-ns pulse width and a rise time of either 3-ns or 9-ns. The spatially and temporally resolved OH production by 10-ns pulse helium plasma jets in ambient air were measured using laser induced fluorescence.

Weare interested in testing whether Stark broadening models can predict the plasma density from multiple elements within the same plasma, and whether this is done self-consistently.

The advantage of the approach is the possibility to treat volumes that are relevant for wastewater treatment or drinking water purification and at least in principle allow for upscaling, respectively. Especially for discharges generated in water, shortening the duration of the applied high voltage pulses increases the energy efficiency of pollutant degradation. This seems to be driven by a more efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals that are primarily responsible for the abatement of pollutants. However, these transient species also readily recombine to hydrogen peroxide, which is a much less efficient oxidizing agent. Implementation of plasmas as water treatment methods therefore need to pay attention and exploit especially also post-discharge chemistries by converting hydrogen peroxide again into hydroxyl radicals by either catalysts or UV-illumination.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575237","Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany(grant numbers:13N1363); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575237","","Degradation;Chemistry;Microorganisms;Purification;Hydrogen;High-voltage techniques;Water pollution","catalysis;catalysts;contamination;discharges (electric);energy conservation;hydrogen compounds;microorganisms;organic compounds;oxidation;plasma applications;purification;sprays;wastewater treatment;water pollution control","applied high voltage pulses;energy efficiency;pollutant degradation;hydroxyl radicals;transient species;hydrogen peroxide;efficient oxidizing agent;water treatment methods;post-discharge chemistries;pulsed discharges;nonthermal plasmas;reaction mechanisms;persistent microorganisms;water sprays;sub-microsecond high voltage pulses;wastewater treatment;microbiological contaminants;chemical contaminants;efficient transient chemistry;drinking water purification;catalysts;UV-illumination;H2O2","","1","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The streaked system enables collecting scattered light from two separate laser pulses separated in time by between 3 and 14 ns from two different scattering angles. The time separation is created by splitting the initial 2.2 ns full width half max duration, 10 J, 526.5 nm laser beam into two separate pulses, each with 2.5 J, and delaying one beam relative to the other. To collect streaked spectra from two angles simultaneously a split fiber bundle was used to couple light from the plasma to the spectrometer, and the size of the fibers, 100 $\mu \mathrm{m}$ diameter, was used as the effective spectral slit width. The 2.5 J laser pulse is shown to heat the plasma jet by inverse bremsstrahlung radiation, as measured by the streaked Thomson scattering system. Analysis of the streak camera image showed that the electron temperature of the Al jet was increased from 20 eV up to 50 eV within about 2 ns for both laser pulses when they were separated by 12 ns in time. Initial results from the Cu jets showed more heating then the Al jets while Ti jets showed the most heating of these three materials. In addition to this increased heating, the scattering profiles from Ti and Cu jets had ion-acoustic features that were more difficult to interpret then those from Al jets. Results from the two scattering angles showed reasonable agreement of the measured electron temperature, and implied that the electron density was at least $2\times 10^{18}\text{cm}^{-3}$.

Plasma-liquid interactions are important in many applications ranging from environmental remediation to material science and health care. Different types of discharge plasmas generated either directly in the liquid, in the gas phase over and in contact with a liquid, or in the multiphase environments such a as discharges in bubbles inside liquids or discharges contacting liquid sprays or foams are used. Much of the work has focused on plasmas in contact with aqueous liquids (primarily water). Depending on the type of discharge, its energy, and the chemical composition of the surrounding environment various types of physical processes (ultraviolet radiation, overpressure shock waves) and plasma-chemical reactions can be initiated. Various short and long-lived chemical species are produced by plasma in the liquid either directly, or transferred from the gas phase discharge plasma being in contact with the liquid. Among these processes, the oxidative properties of reactive oxygen species (OH radical, atomic oxygen, 03, R2O2) and nitrogen species (NO, NO2 radical) are generally accepted to play central role in the chemical and biological effects of plasma produced in gas-liquid environments. These species can react at or penetrate through the plasma-gas/liquid interface and dissolve into the bulk liquid, and can also initiate secondary chemical processes in the liquid. In addition to the use for chemical decontamination processes, plasma in liquid can be used for material processing and synthesis (e.g., production of H2 and polymers from liquid hydrocarbons, or production of nanoparticles). There also novel developments in the understanding of electrical breakdown phenomena in liquid produced in nanosecond pulse duration range.

The multi-weight particle collision techniques developed so far have been largely unable to conserve energy and momentum during each collision. Our new multi-weight collision method conserves momentum and energy in each collision event. The method introduces a real collision counter (RCC) scheme for particle collision pair selection that extends the existing No-Time Counter (NTC) method for single-weight collisions. In addition, our method uses the concept of particle velocity spread that allows to conserve energy and momentum by splitting and merging colliding particles during each collision. The multi-weight collision method is verified by considering relaxation processes of monatomic gases, a one dimensional Couette flow problem, and a heat transfer problem.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575344","AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-14-1-0366); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575344","","Gases;Monte Carlo methods;Particle collisions;Conferences;Merging;Mathematics;Plasmas","Couette flow;flow simulation;heat transfer;Monte Carlo methods;plasma collision processes;plasma simulation","multiweight collision method;single-weight methods;multiweight particle collision techniques;particle collision pair selection;existing No-Time Counter method;single-weight collisions;DSMC-PIC simulation;direct simulation Monte Carlo method;collisional particle-in-cell methods;partially-ionized plasmas;real collision counter scheme;relaxation processes;monatomic gases;one dimensional Couette flow problem;heat transfer","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results have shown the pi-mode frequency and that electron inj ection generates oscillations, but true pi-mode oscillations have not yet been achieved. Once the model is validated, the simulation efforts will accommodate the flat GFEAs by changing the cathode to a 10 sided structure.

The unique feature of plasmas compared to other methods of materials synthesis and processing is that the energy flux is delivered and absorbed at or very near the surface over short time scales, and thus requires fast, surface-sensitive techniques to fully appreciate the dynamics of the plasma-surface interface. To achieve this, we employ pump-probe Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR) to measure the electron and phonon excitation and energy transport dynamics in thin metal films during exposure to an atmospheric pressure plasma jet. The results show the energy delivered by the plasma jet causes a localized thermal spike that is dissipated radially from the point of contact. More specifically, energy delivered via the flux of particles and photons causes the kinetic energy of the electrons within the material to increase over an area commensurate with the plasma jet radius. These results, in conjunction with voltage and current measurements, will be discussed in an effort to develop a first order understanding of energy transfer and relevant kinetics during plasma jet-surface interactions.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575587","Naval Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575587","","Heating systems;Plasma jets;Voltage measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Current measurement;Plasma measurements;Plasmas","metallic thin films;plasma diagnostics;plasma heating;plasma jets;plasma materials processing;plasma-wall interactions;thermal conductivity;thermoreflectance","energy transfer;plasma jet-surface interactions;atmospheric pressure plasma jet;electron heating;energy flux;plasma exposure;associated surface heating;plasma-based materials processing;materials synthesis;short time scales;surface-sensitive techniques;plasma-surface interface;pump-probe time-domain thermoreflectance;kinetic energy;plasma jet radius;thin metal films;pressure 1.0 atm","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alternatively, one may consider a parallel plate geometry under an applied voltage and combine the conservation of energy for an electron, Poisson's equation, and the F owler- Nordheim current density to calculate the electron trajectory and derive universal equations that approach the Child-Langmuir law and Fowler-Nordheim relation in limits of high and low voltage, respectively2. For gaps below the electron mean free path, pressure (collisions) become less important and one may primarily consider the transition from avalanche to field emission to Child-Langmuir; however, for larger gaps where pressure (collisions) becomes important, one must also consider the Mott-Gurney space charge limit, whose transition from Child-Langmuir as a function of collision frequency has previously been considered3,4. This paper assesses the feasibility of unifying field emission with both space charge limits as a function of collision frequency. The implications on larger devices (above the mean free path) for predicting universal breakdown and transitions between Townsend avalanche, field emission, and the two space charge limited regimes will be discussed.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9576006","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0218); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576006","","Geometry;Couplings;Low voltage;Poisson equations;Electric breakdown;Space charge;Mathematical models","current density;electron field emission;electron mean free path;space charge;space-charge-limited conduction","space charge limited flow;Townsend avalanche;parallel plate geometry;electron trajectory;Child-Langmuir law;Fowler-Nordheim relation;Mott-Gurney space charge limit;collision frequency;field emission;electron mean free path;applied voltage;Poisson's equation","","","","4","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For that purpose, we have developped a fully dielectric and millimter sized optical probe based on the Pockels effect, also called electro-optic (EO) effect.

The transduction is vectorial meaning that each eigen component of the E- field vector can be measured in real time. The intrinsic bandwidth of the probe covers more than 8 decades of frequency from 30 Hz up to several GHz.

We present preliminary experimental studies of the dynamics of an annular plasma in background gases. The initial plasma is produced by focusing a Nd:YAG laser beam (1064 nm, 3.5 ns FWHM, $-2\cdot 10^{9}$ W / cm2) onto a flat target employing a combination of a 10 mrad axicon prism and a converging lens, which results in an initial ringlike shape plasma of 1 mm radius and $\sim 150\mu\mathrm{n}$ thickness. Observations of the optical self-emission of Titanium plasmas at 80 mTorr Argon background indicate that the plasma propagates inwards in a time scale ~90 ns, which is then followed by on axis stagnation and formation of a jet-like column. The resulting plasma jet propagates axially forming a planar shock, with characteristic initial velocity $\sim 2\cdot 10^{6}$ cm/s. This planar shock transits to a bow-shock in characteristic timescales of ~600 ns. Further investigations employing two parallel coaxial NdFeB magnets, which produce a static magnetic field of ~0.1 T, suggest that confinement effects due to the magnetic field increases the transition time from planar to bow-shock to ~ 700 ns. Additional experiments have been conducted with Graphite and Titanium target in high pressure Argon and air backgrounds. By using schlieren laser imaging (532 nm, 3.5 ns FWHM) from Carbon and Titanium annular plasmas it is found that the characteristic on-axis stagnation times increase up to ~300 ns at 760 Torr. In a first approximation, both, the radial expansion of the annular plasma and the axial propagation of the resulting plasma jet can be described adequately by the drag model2. Based on these observations, a comprehensive description of the dynamics of laser produced annular plasmas, over a wide set of parameters, will be presented.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575559","FONDECYT(grant numbers:1180100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575559","","Particle beams;Laser theory;Plasma jets;Shape;Titanium;Ring lasers;Laser modes","argon;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma jets;plasma light propagation;plasma production by laser;plasma shock waves;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes","plasma propagates;planar shock;bow-shock;air backgrounds;schlieren laser imaging;laser produced annular plasmas;ring shape plasma;solid target;ax icon prism;convergent lens;laser beam;converging lens;initial ringlike shape plasma;titanium plasmas;argon background;axicon prism;plasma jet;characteristic on-axis stagnation","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, traditional spark gaps are normally limited by their low repetition frequencies of less than 100Hz. Studies have shown that a phenomenon named corona-stabilization may provide enough insulating recovery time for the gap to prevent pre-breakdown. Based on the corona-stabilization, a kind of spark gap switch named corona stabilized switch has been designed with the aim of operating at kHz level[1], but the advantages of traditional spark gap switch such as high self-breakdown voltage are sacrificed because of the structural features.

Thus, it is very important to study the dynamics of kinetic Alfven waves in order to understand various energy transport mechanisms in plasmas. The trapping of the particles was shown to be important while investigating the nonlinear characteristics of waves. In the present work, we have discussed the effects of vortex-like distribution of electrons on obliquely propagating dust acoustic kinetic Alfven waves in a low β plasma. Using the two potential theory and employing the Sagdeev potential approach, we have investigated the existence of arbitrary amplitude coupled dust acoustic kinetic Alfvenic solitary waves in the frame work of trapped electrons distribution. The present investigation may be beneficial in understanding the propagation of solitary structures in different space environments where trapped populations of electrons have been observed.

The results show within a burst of repetitive pulses, that the remnant energy of the previous pulse caused a significant temperature increase at the ignition of the following pulse if the time between pulses was less than $100\mu\mathrm{s}$. This indicated that the discharges were “coupled” for frequencies above 10 kHz and temperatures continued to rise throughout the burst series. At even higher frequencies, the rapid temperature rise within the burst of pulses was found to be several thousand Kelvin over a few microseconds. This type of rapid heating could be very advantageous in controlling ignition probability in a combustion system.

A particular challenge is understanding the fundamental role played by various solid-state physical quantities, such as the fermi level, work function, the charge exchange-correlation potential, the image charge potential, and the electron affinity in devices that also have free charge in vacuum adjacent to the material surface. These questions become particularly vexing when the energy in the applied electromagnetic field and the energy in the space-charge fields of the emitted particles become of comparable magnitude. While considerable progress has been made in practical models to see scaling laws for particle emission physics, as well as development of algorithms that support high-fidelity emission physics in large-scale particle-in-cell “gun-code” models, here, we strive to reconsider the fundamental nature of the solid-vacuum barrier in the context of a one-dimensional quantum hydrodynamics approach that employs an orbital-free dynamical density functional theory.

Our methods explicitly compare the fidelity of the basic Thomas-Fermi model, the Kirzhnits-corrected Thomas-Fermi model, the addition of an exchange-correlation functional, and finally all these components to isolate the role each of these models plays in the complex physical process of electron emission.

However, these methods require lots of spaces and high cost for operating equipment because of high power-consumption and relatively big size of equipment. Furthermore, there has been no report on the compact, portable, and low power-consumption APP device for direct water-pretreatment sensors applications. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the microplasma water-pretreatment device with streamer discharge, which is compact, portable, and low power-consumption, in order to increase the efficiency of plasma generation for direct water-pretreatment. So, here we report the novel and portable APP device for rapid water-pretreatment with low-power consumption by microplasma discharge. Thereby, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis.), and PH meter measurements have been investigated systematically with respect to various parameters, such as multi-pin to plate, DBD-to-water structures, micro-pulse, nano-pulse, electrode shape, and driving condition, respectively.

However, few report has researched the arc interruption under considering of the phase state of the current. In addition, it is also necessary to investigate the effective SF6 gas blowing. In this paper, the arc temperature distribution and SF6 gas behavior were elucidated with changing the blowing timing of SF6 gas. As a result, the mean of SF6 contamination rate near the anode increased and the arc temperature decreased in the case of the advance of the SF6 gas blowing timing.

In this case, the strict perturbed-entropy H -theorem is no longer satisfied. This issue has been recognized, and one approach for dealing with it has been proposed for the case of plasma species with different temperatures but no relative flow.5 For the case of interpenetrating plasma streams, of interest to us, we have developed an alternate generalized linear operator, and have implemented it in a test code.

Uniform dielectric barrier discharges have many potentially trans formative industrial applications, including uniform thin-film deposition, surface modification of polymers, sterilization of biological samples, treatment of living tissues and cells for their advantages of low gas temperature, moderate power density, uniform energy distribution, controllability of chemical composition and so on. Uniform DBDs are traditionally generated at special conditions (e.g., low pressure, rare gases), and in atmospheric air are of filamentary nature. Recent developments in pulsed power generation technology allowed controllable application of fast-rising short (nanosecond) high voltage pulses for generation of pulsed discharges. In our preliminary studies we have been able to perform fast imaging of the discharge development on nanosecond time scales in atmospheric air, and show transition of DBD from filamentary to uniform mode. We show that the discharge uniformity may be achieved in the case of strong overvoltage (provided by fast rise times), when anode-directed streamers are formed. Here we present our results on fast ICCD imaging of DBD in atmospheric air for uniformity analysis, as well as time- and space-resolved temperature and local electric filed measurements using OES.

This occurs when the linear focusing forces of the ion column acting on the electron beam are perfectly balanced against the emittance-driven divergence of the beam. The matching condition is satisfied when the square of the beam size equals the product of the geometric emittance and the inverse betatron wave number of the beam inside the plasma. In practice, however, the matched beam size is too small to achieve with conventional beam delivery systems operating in vacuum. Here, a passive, tapered plasma density ramp at the entrance (exit) of the plasma source is described that can focus the electron beam to (from) the necessary matched size at a rate exceeding the adiabatic plasma focusing limit without diluting the beam's emittance. A numerically derived empirical model predicts both the plasma ramp shape and parameter tolerances required for beam matching as a function of the incoming beam parameters. These results can be easily scaled for the purpose of designing sequential plasma stages in a high-energy linear collider.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575269","Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-SC0017906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575269","","Vacuum systems;Electron beams;Shape;Focusing;Predictive models;Ions;Plasmas","beam handling techniques;betatrons;electron accelerators;electron beams;linear colliders;particle beam bunching;particle beam stability;plasma accelerators;plasma density;plasma light propagation;plasma sources;wakefield accelerators","beam matching;electron beam emittance preservation;beam-driven;nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerator;emittance-driven divergence;matching condition;geometric emittance;matched beam size;conventional beam delivery systems;passive tapered plasma density ramp;plasma source;necessary matched size;adiabatic plasma focusing limit;plasma ramp shape;parameter tolerances;incoming beam parameters;sequential plasma stages","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, electrons are treated as a fluid for such simulations, however, in our recent1 kinetic treatment of electrons we have shown that the electron velocity distribution in an expanding plume is anisotropic. In particular, we found that when the electron source is shifted compared to the ion beam, as is observed in realistic ion engine configurations, holes develop in the electron phase-space within 3,000 electron plasma periods, i.e., $3,000\omega_{\text{pe}}\ ^{-1}$. This bi-modal electron velocity distribution is known to trigger a two-stream instability, and affect the ion dynamics. The times-scale over which the ion dynamics2 is affected is typically $40\omega_{\text{pi}}^{-1}$ or $12,000\omega_{\text{pe}}\ ^{-1}$. A major issue in modeling electrons kinetically is that, when electrons exit the domain, a virtual anode is developed, leading to non-physical effects. To work around this problem, the kinetic plasma plume simulations are terminated before the leading-edge of the plume, called the beam-front, crosses the boundary thereby avoiding boundary-effects. However, important physics, such as, ion beam neutralization as well as the effect of bi-modal electron velocity distribution on the ion beam evolution require long simulations times.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575757","","Fluids;Plasma accelerators;Conferences;Charge carrier processes;Ions;Plasmas;Kinetic theory","aerospace propulsion;astrophysical jets;ion beams;ion engines;plasma accelerators;plasma collision processes;plasma instability;plasma kinetic theory;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes","electrons exit;kinetic plasma plume simulations;ion beam neutralization;bi-modal electron velocity distribution;ion beam evolution;self-consistent boundary condition;plasma plume evolution;fully kinetic pic approach;thruster plumes;plasma accelerators;kinetic treatment;electron source;electron phase-space;ion dynamics;electron plasma periods;two-stream instability;ion engine configurations;electron velocity distribution","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TECs are comprised of narrowly-separated plates held at specified voltages. Thermionic emission at the cathode releases electrons which travel to the anode, producing a current which may generate electrical power. Simple structures are often space-charge limited, because operating temperatures produce currents exceeding the corresponding Child- Langmuir limit for the device. The steady-state dynamics of a TEC depend on the emission characteristics of the cathode and anode, an array of intra-gap electrodes and dielectric structures, and the self-consistent dynamics of the electrons in the gap. Fundamental advances in the efficiency of these devices can be achieved through optimization of the electrode arrangements along with new low-work-function materials. We present results from simulations of these devices using the particle-in-cell code Warp1, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. We evaluate the total efficiency of these devices through the quantification of individual energy loss mechanisms, including kinetic losses, radiative losses, and dielectric charging. Using nonlinear optimization schemes including evolutionary algorithms, we find peak operating points for realistic conditions. We then discuss the potential for TECs to operate as individual power sources or in conjunction with conventional power plants.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575766","","Temperature;Thermionic emission;Dielectric losses;Steady-state;Plasmas;Anodes;Optimization","electric power generation;evolutionary computation;optimisation;power system stability;space charge;thermionic conversion;thermionic emission","TEC;electric energy;narrowly-separated plates;specified voltages;thermionic emission;cathode releases electrons;anode;electrical power;simple structures;space-charge;corresponding Child- Langmuir limit;steady-state dynamics;emission characteristics;intra-gap electrodes;dielectric structures;self-consistent dynamics;electrode arrangements;low-work-function materials;Lawrence Berkeley National Lab;individual energy loss mechanisms;dielectric charging;nonlinear optimization schemes;high current thermionic energy converters","","2","","1","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current and microwave parameters without any sig-nificant differences between the two cathodes were detected.

SEM images show that no observable damage can be detected for the SiC fibers after several tens of shots. However, a small area of SiC fibers with dimensions of 3mmx3mm broke away from the carbon blanket base after several tens of shots which probably caused by poor binding strength between the SiC fibers and the carbon blanket.

Directional patterns of mass, charge and velocity of particles in plasma bunches are important parameters by which the efficiency of PPT is characterized. In this work we measured directional patterns of plasma bunches generated on the surfaces of PTFE, PMMA, and polyethylene. We used nanosecond pulse generator with a stored energy of 2 J, output voltage of 90 kV, and current pulse duration of 30 ns. The discharge unit has a linear electrode geometry with a 20-mm gap. The ion current of the plasma bunch was registered by a Faraday cup positioned in two mutually perpendicular planes. The angular distributions of ion charge for all materials have a peculiar axial asymmetry which is typical for the spatial distribution of particulate mass [1]. The angular distributions of average ion velocity are also axially asymmetric but not similar. The directional patterns of ion velocities in the plane perpendicular to the sample surface and in which a discharge path lies are almost the same for all three materials, whereas the patterns in the plane normal to the discharge path differ noticeably. We show that for PTFE samples the average ion velocity demonstrates a slow linear decrease from 110 to 100 km/s as the angle changes from 0 to 75 degrees, respectively. By contrast, the ion velocities for PMMA and polyethylene in the normal direction are lower than for the others growing almost linearly from 150 km/s for the normal direction to 180 km/s for angle of 60 degrees. Analysis of the physical mechanism of this effect allows for an increase in the efficiency of PPTs.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575978","","Pulse generation;Polyethylene;Surface discharges;High-voltage techniques;Flashover;Ions;Plasma measurements","aerospace propulsion;discharges (electric);electrodes;flashover;plasma devices;plasma diagnostics;plasma flow;plasma sources;plasma transport processes;pulse generators","directional pattern;plasma bunch;PPT;nanosecond pulse generator;current pulse duration;ion current;angular distributions;ion charge;average ion velocity;sample surface;normal direction;plasma flow;nanosecond surface flashover;high voltage vacuum surface flashover;fast particles;highly efficient pulsed plasma thrusters;polyethylene;PMMA;PTFE;Faraday cup;angular distribution;particulate mass;velocity 150.0 km/s;velocity 180.0 km/s;velocity 100.0 km/s to 110.0 km/s;energy 2.0 J;voltage 90.0 kV;time 30.0 ns","","","","1","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this, antibacterial plasma polymer nanocomposites have been studied for years due to their antibacterial potency1. Unfortunately, the application of these nanocomposites is often hindered by the fact that they are soft and not mechanically stable. Therefore, a hard plasma polymer layer is crucial that can withstand wear abrasion and at the same time shows antibacterial potency2, In this study, a low-pressure plasma-based method was employed for the deposition of hard polymeric nanocomposite coatings containing Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) on Ti substrates. This method uses a gas aggregation source (GAS) for the formation and deposition of Ag nanoparticles and combines it with plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of an amorphous hydrocarbon matrix (a-C:H) that is deposited in a mixture of Ar and n-hexane on substrates placed on a powered RF electrode. The matrix properties can be modified by adapting the applied RF power while the amount of incorporated Ag nanoparticles can be altered by the operational parameters of the GAS. The focus of this study is to deposit an a-C:H matrix containing Ag nanoparticles on Ti substrates and to optimize the working parameters to achieve a mechanically stable coating possessing anti -bacterial properties. Three different types of nanocomposite layers are studied: 1) nanocomposite films by simultaneous deposition of AgNPs and an a-C:H matrix 2) sandwich structures with base and top layers of a-C:H and an AgNP interlayer 3) quasi sandwich films with a base layer of a-C:H and a second layer of simultaneous deposition of AgNPs and an a-C:H matrix.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575512","","Nanoparticles;Radio frequency;Films;Implants;Titanium;Antibacterial activity;Plasmas","abrasion;antibacterial activity;biomedical materials;coatings;hardness;microorganisms;nanocomposites;nanofabrication;nanoparticles;plasma CVD;plasma deposition;polymer films;prosthetics;sandwich structures;silver;thin films;titanium;titanium compounds;ultraviolet spectra;visible spectra;wear","implant applications;bacterial infections;titanium implants;orthopedic field;antibacterial plasma polymer nanocomposites;antibacterial potency;hard plasma polymer layer;wear abrasion;low-pressure plasma-based method;hard polymeric nanocomposite coatings;Ti substrates;gas aggregation source;plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition;amorphous hydrocarbon matrix;powered RF electrode;matrix properties;applied RF power;mechanically stable coating;nanocomposite layers;simultaneous deposition;a-C:H matrix;antibacterial properties;antimicrobial Ag-a-C:H nanocomposite;Ag;C:H;Ti","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, a thermionic cathode is used as the electron source and a heater is needed to increase the temperature of the cathode up to about 1,000 K. Recently, field emission arrays have been demonstrated being capable of experimentally emitting> 100 A/cm2 current densities and this makes employing field emission as electron sources in microwave tubes possible. In this work, a field emission based rising-sun magnetron is investigated for industrial applications as an easier configuration and longer lifetime can be expected. The design and development are performed using a conformal finite-difference time-domain particle-in-cell simulation as implemented in the VSim code. The goal of this research is to design and develop magnetrons operating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and at a working power of > 3 kW for industrial applications. A preliminary design after the optimization could achieve the required power at a high efficiency of > 70%. One of the advantages is the fabrication and assembly can be much simplified compared with those of a conventional strapped magnetron based on a thermionic cathode.

In order to learn more about residual surface charge role an experiment with a rotating dielectric electrode and a pin electrode (325 μm tip radius) is realized2. The rotating dielectric barrier enables DBD-operation with DC high voltage and, the remaining surface charges are removed by a second grounded electrode which is sliding over the dielectric. Thus, single, repetitive microdischarges in air at atmospheric pressure are ignited without participation of residual surface charges. These microdischarges were investigated by ICCD camera, electrical measurements and time-correlated single photon counting (sub-ns, sub-mm and spectral resolution). For positive polarity of the pin electrode a positive streamer starting from the middle of the gap followed by a secondary wave starting from the metal electrode is observed.

More particularly, the P2 asymmetry of Au's M-band flux can also severely in fluence the implosion performance of ignition capsules2. Due to the higher opacity of Uranium than Au at temperatures ~300eV, U hohlraums are being more widely used to achieve high temperature X-ray drives at NIF. Its M-band flux, however, is much harder and more asymmetric than that of Au hohlraums. Here we study the P2 asymmetry of U's M-band flux and its effects on ICF ignition targets, and explore the methods of smoothing Au and /or U M-band flux P2 asymmetries by mid- and/or high-Z dopants in ablator. Our results show (1) mid- or high-Z dopants absorb hard x-rays (M-band flux) and re-emit isotropically, which helps to smooth the asymmetric M -band flux arriving at the ablation front, therefore reducing the P2 asymmetries of the imploding shell and hot spot; (2) the smoothing effect of Ge-dopant is more remarkable than Si-dopant because of its higher opacity in M-band than the latter; and (3) placing the doped layer at a larger radius in ablator is more efficient. Applying this effect may not be a main measure to reduce the low-mode implosion asymmetry, but might be of significance in some critical situations such as Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) experiments very near the performance cliffs of asymmetric x-ray drives.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575401","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11575034,11275031,11401033,11205017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575401","","Gold;Laser theory;Smoothing methods;Uranium;Measurement by laser beam;Ignition;X-ray lasers","elemental semiconductors;explosions;fusion reactor fuel;fusion reactor ignition;fusion reactor targets;germanium;gold;laser fusion;opacity;plasma diagnostics;plasma inertial confinement;plasma simulation;silicon","M-band flux;P2 asymmetry;high-Z dopants;low-mode implosion asymmetry;P2 Asymmetry;hard X-ray flux;laser heated high-Z cavities;X-ray drive asymmetry;National Ignition Facility;ignition capsules;high temperature X-ray drives;gold hohlraums;ICF ignition targets;germanium dopant;Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments;electron volt energy 300.0 eV;Ge;Si;Au;U","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the recent progress of nanosecond-pulse SDBD actuator is introduced. Then, investigation is performed on characteristics of ns-SDBD with different parameters (rise time, pulse width and PRF) of SDBD actuator with two-electrode structure, which has not been widely discussed in the literature. The nanosecond generator can provide a voltage of 0 ~ 15 kV, a rise time of 0 ~ 500 ns and pulse width at peak of 0~ 100 μs, respectively. Experimental results show that plasma discharge mainly takes place during the rise time and fall time, respectively. When the rise time increases, the amplitude of the current gradually decreases and multiple discharges occur, while the ignition of the discharge is delayed by tens of nanoseconds due to high ionization rate. Moreover, the discharge becomes relatively homogenous at the rise time of 50 ns but the plasma length is slightly affected by the rise time. The maximum deposited energy can be obtained at the rise time of 50 ns, little effect appears on the deposited energy when the rise time increases from 100 to 500 ns, which is positively related to the intensity of induced compression wave and propagation velocity. The peak velocity of induced pressure wave decreases from 408 m/s to 369 m/s when the rise time increases from 50 ns to 400 ns. Furthermore, it is shown that pulse width has slightly effect on the current amplitude and discharge uniformity, but longer pulse width will produce more deposited energy and induce two pressure waves. In addition, with the increase of PRF from 250 Hz to 1250Hz, the body force increases from 0.245 mN to 2.107 mN, which is proportional to PRF. To sum up, the actuator operated with short time, long pulse width and high frequency is conductive to shack interaction and airflow control.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575556","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51577177); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575556","","Actuators;Power demand;Surface discharges;Ionization;Ignition;Aerodynamics;Discharges (electric)","actuators;aerodynamics;dielectric-barrier discharges;electrodes;flow control;plasma devices;plasma diagnostics;plasma flow;plasma shock waves;surface discharges","nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge;pulse parameters;plasma aerodynamic actuator;nanosecond-pulse surface dielectric barrier discharge;ns-SDBD;nanosecond-pulse SDBD actuator;plasma discharge;rise time;long pulse width;high ionization rate;compression wave;propagation velocity;voltage 0.0 kV to 15.0 kV;time 0.0 ns to 500.0 ns;time 0.0 mus to 100.0 mus;velocity 369.0 m/s to 408.0 m/s;frequency 250.0 Hz to 1250.0 Hz","","","","1","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then a high density plasma is created by applying high power pulses at low frequency and low duty cycle to a magnetron sputtering device. Here we discuss the large discharge currents observed in HiPIMS discharges. We discuss the current composition and the role of self-sputter (SS-) recycling and working gas recycling within the discharge. We find that above a critical current density $\mathrm{J}_{\text{crit}}\approx 0.2\mathrm{A}/\text{cm}^{2}$, a combination of self-sputter recycling and working gas-recycling is the general case [1]. For high self-sputtering yields, above $\mathrm{Y}_{\text{SS}}\approx 1$, the discharges become dominated by SS-recycling, contain only a few hot secondary electrons that have been accelerated across the cathode sheath and have a relatively low effective electron temperature. Here, stable plateau values of the discharge current develop during long pulses, and these values increase monotonically with the applied voltage. For low self-sputtering yields, below $\mathrm{Y}_{\text{SS}}\approx 0.2$, the discharges operated above $\mathrm{J}_{\text{crit}}$ are dominated by working gas recycling, acceleration of secondary electrons has a significant role and the effective electron temperature is higher, while the current evolution is generally less stable. For intermediate values of $\mathrm{Y}_{\text{SS}}$ the discharge character gradually shifts between these two types. In addition, these new insights on ion recycling have been applied to a series of selected sputter materials. For high currents a discharge with Al target develops almost pure self -sputter recycling, while a discharge with Ti target exhibits close to a 50/50 combination of self-sputter recycling and working gas-recycling [2]. However, if the Ti target is operated in a reactive Ar/O2 gas mixture, it is found that working gas-recycling is dominating [1] and that the Ar+- ions contribute almost solely to the discharge current [3].","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575376","","Critical current density (superconductivity);Magnetic devices;Voltage;Physical vapor deposition;Ions;Discharges (electric);Recycling","argon;discharges (electric);gas mixtures;plasma chemistry;plasma density;plasma deposition;plasma sheaths;plasma transport processes;thin films;titanium","magnetron sputtering device;HiPIMS discharges;current composition;working gas recycling;critical current density;self-sputter recycling;working gas-recycling;SS-recycling;hot secondary electrons;discharge character;ion recycling;high currents;pure self -sputter recycling;high-power impulse magnetron sputtering discharge;plasma assisted physical vapor deposition methods;high-density plasma;high-power pulses;duty cycle;discharge current;sputter materials;electron temperature","","2","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The uniformity of the array is characterized and studied by deviation angles of plasma plumes from the optical and gas channel from Schlieren images, and the electrical interactions are investigated by estimating the actions of Coulomb forces and Lorentz force, with the influence of the applied voltage and gas flow rate on these effects being studied. Results show that both hydrodynamic and electrical interactions exist among the jets in the array. The measured current and dissipated power of the jet array are not three times as large as those of a single jet, and deviations of the side jets are observed both in the flow field and lighting images. The difference between two deflection angles in optical and Schlieren images indicates the j oint effort of hydrodynamic and electrical interactions which determinates the shape of plasma plumes in the array. The hydrodynamic interaction is considered to be caused by the gas heating and the pressure fluctuation, and the electrical interaction is caused by the accumulation of impulsive Coulomb force between the adjacent streamer channels of the plasma plume. Increasing the gas flow rate and limiting the applied voltage can restrain the interactions and thus contribute to a uniform jet array.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575862","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51677083); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575862","","Integrated optics;Power measurement;Plasma jets;Shape;Fluid flow;Optical imaging;Hydrodynamics","argon;discharges (electric);flow visualisation;hydrodynamics;plasma diagnostics;plasma jets;plasma materials processing;plasma transport processes","Schlieren images;electrical interaction;plasma plume;hydrodynamic interaction;gas flow rate;applied voltage;uniform jet array;atmospheric pressure plasma jet array;linear jet array;optical diagnosis;electrical diagnosis;optical gas channel;flow field;lighting images;Schlieren diagnosis;Lorentz force;Coulomb force;gas heating;adjacent streamer channels;pressure 1.0 atm;Ar","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies1, 2 have found viable PRRSv aerosols up to 4 kilometers downwind of infected pigs. Consequently, protection against airborne transmission is a priority in the industry. Unlike conventional air filters that only address the transport of infectious aerosols, non-thermal plasmas (NTPs) can address both aerosol transport and aerosol infectivity3 by electrostatically removing larger aerosols and inactivating the remaining smaller aerosols including viral aerosols. Previous laboratory experiments at U niv. of Michigan ultrasonically aerosolized MS2 phage, producing aerosols that were then entrained in the air flow supplied to a packed bed DBD reactor operated between 12 and 30 kV AC (60 Hz). Using virus stocks and wind tunnel facilities provided by the Univ. of Minnesota, the same reactor was tested for effectiveness in inactivating PRRSv. An air-jet atomizer aerosolized solutions containing ~105 TCID50/ml of PRRS VR2332 strain, aerosols that were then entrained in the air flow supplied to the reactor. Twin impingers upstream and downstream of the reactor collected pre- and post-treatment samples followed by TCID50 assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. Over the range of voltages applied, results showed that PRRSv was inactivated to an equal or greater degree as MS2 under the same conditions. The results do not suggest any protective effect of the additional lipid layer that surrounds enveloped viruses (such as PRRSv) as compared to nonenveloped viruses (such as MS2).

The absorption is studied by varying the polarization and energy of the plasma-generated pulse. The results suggest no significant polarization dependence on the absorption features. As the laser intensity of the plasma-generated pulse grows, the central frequency of the resonance absorption increases, as well as the electron density. This indicates the intrinsic relationship between the plasma frequency and the resonance absorption. Therefore, the resonance absorption at the THz frequency range provides an alternative to characterize plasma properties, especially for the plasma with typical frequency at the THz range. Furthermore, our results are supplements to the existing theories on THz generation from the filament.

Marx circuits based on the avalanche transistors is capable of generating pulses with extremely short width (down to several nanoseconds or picoseconds) and high repetitive frequency (up to MHz), suitable for the plasma generation. Traditional avalanche transistor Marx circuits are constructed on the resistor-isolation topology. Previous studies showed that single Marx circuit is capable of generating pulses with about several kV and 10kHz repetitive rate on a resistive load. However, the achievable repetitive rate of the resistor-isolation topology is limited by the RC time constant and the output voltage amplitude will decrease with smaller resistance due to the weaker pulse-isolation-effect in the Marx erection phase. Meanwhile, the total energy efficiency is unavoidable low due to the energy loss in resistors, mainly in the charging phase. In this paper, the inductor-isolation avalanche transistor Marx circuit was designed for efficiently improving the repetitive output capability and total energy efficiency. The influential factors on the output performance were studied including inductance of isolation inductors, number of stages of Marx circuit and capacitance of main capacitor. Continuous output operation mode and burst output operation mode were also designed for various applications.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9576005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576005","","Resistors;Resistance;Pulse generation;Plasma jets;Voltage;Production;Energy efficiency","energy conservation;inductors;plasma production;power capacitors;pulse generators;pulsed power supplies;resistors","inductor-isolation avalanche transistor Marx circuit;total energy efficiency;high repetitive frequency nanosecond pulse generator;plasma generation;resistor-isolation topology;output voltage amplitude;weaker pulse-isolation-effect;capacitor;frequency 10.0 kHz","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the important applications of NTP is the purification of air and exhaust gases by removing toxic substances, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well as some inorganic compounds (NOx, SO2, CS2 etc.). Due to the extreme variety of research objects and methods of exposure, there is a significant problem of correct comparison of energy the efficiencies of NTP-based methods. In [1], [2] we proposed to use a mixture of VOCs with different reactivities to estimate the parameters of the NTP generated by a pulsed corona discharge. Components of the mixture react with plasma components at different rates, so their concentration dependencies give information on the qualitative and quantitative parameters of the plasma. On the other hand, NTP also is a mixture comprised of active particles of various types (ions, electrons, radicals, excited molecules, etc.) which react with the mixture components of at different rates. Mathematical modeling of these reactions is extremely time-consuming because the values of the reaction rate constants are unknown. To clarify the main characteristics of the plasma, we propose to use two groups of vapor mixtures: a mixture of poly-functional compounds and a mixture of halogen-containing compounds. These mixtures may be considered as standard for estimation of the energy efficiency of NTP-based methods. In this work, the characteristics of plasma generated by pulsed corona discharge and pulsed electron beam irradiation are compared using this standard mixtures method. It is shown that these methods of plasma generation are different in terms of energy efficiency, whereas the basic plasma and chemical processes they initiate are similar. The method proposed here can be used to study the characteristics of various types of discharges and develop new technological applications.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575931","Russian Foundation for Basic Research(grant numbers:17-08-01212); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575931","","Volatile organic compounds;Plasma properties;Radiation effects;Purification;Discharges (electric);Energy efficiency;Corona","air pollution control;corona;discharges (electric);electron beam effects;energy conservation;mathematical analysis;mixtures;organic compounds;plasma chemistry;plasma materials processing;purification;reaction rate constants;toxicology","nonthermal atmospheric pressure plasma;physical processes;chemical processes;significant heating;exhaust gases;toxic substances removal;volatile organic compounds;inorganic compounds;NTP-based methods;pulsed corona discharge;reaction rate constants;vapor mixtures;poly-functional compounds;halogen-containing compounds;energy efficiency;standard mixtures method;plasma generation;Physical-chemical properties;VOC;mathematical modeling;electron beam irradiation;purification","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Control of the pulse intensity is achieved using a superposition of Bessel beams created by a tandem lens setup.

"Overview of the first Wendelstein 7-X divertor experimental campaign","S. A.

This island divertor consists of ten graphite modules which intersect an n/m=5/5 magnetic island chain, located at the plasma edge. Operation with such a divertor allowed regular plasma operation in excess of 25 s, reaching densities greater than 1. $2\mathrm{x}10^{20}\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ with 7 MW ECRH only. Glow discharge and ECRH discharge cleaning in He was found to be an effective tool for wall conditioning. Pellet injection and ECRH allowed achievement of a record plasma stored energy of 1.1 MJ at a density of $8\mathrm{x}10^{19}\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ and ion/electron temperature equilibration around 3.5 keV. It was observed that during these pellet-fueled discharges, a reduction in divertor heat flux by a factor of ten was possible, suggesting detachment. Long pulse operation with 75 MJ of injected ERCH energy at densities of $4\mathrm{x}10^{19}\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ were routinely run. It was found that even at this level of injected energy the divertor was not yet near operational temperature limits. Operation above 1. $2\mathrm{x}10^{20}\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ in Helium was made possible through successful X2 to 02 switchover. Error fields in the experiment were confirmed to be small and the n/m= 1/1 error field (critical to divertor operation) was compensated. Electron Cyclotron Current Drive (ECCD) experiments demonstrated co-ECCD currents up to 13 kA. Associated with these experiments were core temperature crashes suggesting sawtooth-like mode activity. Fast camera and Langmuir probe measurements detected evidence of edge and scrap-off layer turbulence. While phase contrast imaging detected varying levels of broad-band turbulence along with coherent mode activity. This presentation will cover these high-level results along with expectations for the upcoming NBI heated experimental program.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575285","Euratom(grant numbers:633053); U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC02-09CH11466); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575285","","Temperature measurement;Heating systems;Training;Temperature;Tools;Discharges (electric);Plasmas","fusion reactor design;fusion reactor divertors;fusion reactor ignition;fusion reactor instrumentation;fusion reactor operation;plasma beam injection heating;plasma boundary layers;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma fluctuations;plasma instability;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma radiofrequency heating;plasma temperature;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes;stellarators;Tokamak devices","injected ERCH energy;operational temperature limits;error fields;divertor operation;electron cyclotron current drive experiments;Wendelstein 7-X divertor;magnetic field;inertially cooled island divertor;plasma edge;regular plasma operation;7 MW ECRH;glow discharge;pellet injection;record plasma stored energy;pellet-fueled discharges;divertor heat flux;long pulse operation;ion-electron temperature equilibration;current 13.0 kA;radius 5.5 m;radius 0.5 m;time 25.0 s;power 7.0 MW;energy 1.1 MJ;electron volt energy 3.5 keV;energy 75.0 MJ;He","","","","0","USGov","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, idealized sub-volumes are often used to study small-scale effects including the dynamics of magnetized turbulence. One significant aspect of the dynamics of the turbulent cascade is the transfer of energy from the large to small scales. In this work, we present a new shell-to-shell energy transfer analysis framework for understanding cascades of energy within compressible magnetized turbulence. We demonstrate the viability of this framework through application to a series of isothermal subsonic and supersonic magnetized turbulence simulations and utilize results from this analysis to establish benchmarks in the non-linear regime for cross-code comparison. We further utilize these simulations to study how the autocorrelation time and normalization of the large-scale driving systematically change properties of the turbulence. In general, we show that shorter autocorrelation times require more power in the acceleration field. More power in the acceleration field results in more power in compressive modes that weaken the anti-correlation between density and magnetic field strength. We examine how these results can impact a range of diagnostics relevant for a range of terrestrial and astrophysical applications.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575630","Sandia National Laboratories; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575630","","Analytical models;Energy exchange;Conferences;Benchmark testing;Numerical simulation;Plasmas;Magnetic analysis","astrophysical plasma;numerical analysis;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;plasma turbulence;stochastic processes","terrestrial plasmas;astrophysical plasmas;dynamical ranges;direct numerical simulations;idealized sub-volumes;small-scale effects;turbulent cascade;shell-to-shell energy transfer analysis framework;compressible magnetized turbulence;isothermal subsonic magnetized turbulence simulations;autocorrelation time;acceleration field results;magnetic field strength;terrestrial applications;astrophysical applications","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As one may envision, a more compact transportable array will provide additional research opportunities at latitudes previously unexplored. For instance, closer to the equator where the Earth's magnetic field is primarily parallel to the ground. An electrically small inductively coupled antenna is considered for its suitability in such an array. A Small or Semi Loop Antenna (SLA) inductively couples to a Capacitively Loaded Loop (CLL) providing high efficiency and natural 50 $\Omega$ port matching. The CLL, of hinged petal design, consists of a large parallel plate capacitor, and half cylinder inductive sections which are hinged at the base to allow for tuning in the range of ionospheric heating (3 - 10 MHz) with a plate included angle of 0 - 16°. A prototype antenna was designed and evaluated at 1/10th scale - for ease of research efforts - with tuning range of 30 - 100 MHz including capability of tuning the coupling between SLA and CLL to achieve good source matching across the tuning range, particularly at the low and high ends. This tuning method may also be used to compensate for mutual impedance effects in array operation, improving array performance. A gain of approximately 5 dBi is observed when placed upon a sufficiently large ground plane. Tuning of the antenna prototype is achieved via stepper motor driven system to remotely adjust both the CLL and SLA angles continuously.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575799","","Couplings;Conferences;Prototypes;Plasmas;Magnetic fields;Impedance;Tuning","antenna feeds;antenna radiation patterns;capacitors;electric impedance;loop antennas;metamaterial antennas;UHF antennas","Small Antenna design;transportable ionospheric;ionospheric heating;fixed location arrays;limits research efforts;fixed locations;compact transportable array;additional research opportunities;Earth's magnetic field;electrically small inductively coupled antenna;Capacitively Loaded Loop;CLL;natural 50 Ω port matching;hinged petal design;parallel plate capacitor;half cylinder inductive sections;prototype antenna;tuning range;MHz including capability;good source matching;low ends;high ends;tuning method;mutual impedance effects;array operation;array performance;antenna prototype;SLA angles;current 5.0 A;frequency 3.0 MHz to 10.0 MHz;frequency 30.0 MHz to 100.0 MHz","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Improving the effectiveness of substrates used in vehicular emissions abatement hinges on the ability to discern the contributions of gas-phase species in surface reactions. A fundamental understanding of interactions between plasma species is essential to characterizing complex plasma chemistry phenomena. Inductively-coupled NxOy plasma systems were investigated to determine relationships between precursor chemistry and gas-surface interface reactions with different substrates. Precursor chemistry was probed via gas-phase diagnostics; time-resolved optical emission data elucidated NO(g) and N2(g) production kinetics from NxOy source gases, whereas steady-state emission and absorbance data provide information on energy partitioning between different degrees of freedom (e.g. vibrational and rotational modes).1 We have also explored the role of electrons within these discharges through the analysis of Ar emission lines. Ultimately, these data afford significant insight into understanding of molecule formation and decomposition pathways, as well as overall plasma chemistry in nitrogen and oxygen containing plasma systems of interest to pollution abatement. Additionally, these gas phase studies were performed in the presence of flat, micro- and nanostructured materials. Specifically, interface studies explored the influence of both non-catalytic (e.g. Si wafers, glass slides) and catalytic (e.g., Pt foil, Au films, zeolites) substrates on both the kinetics and energetics within various NxOy discharges. Optical spectroscopies were employed to measure the relative gas phase density of NO, N2, and OH as a function of plasma operating parameters (i.e. applied rf power, gas mixture, substrate architecture). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were utilized to assess surface chemistry, substrate morphology, and bulk characteristics of the material, respectively, before and after plasma exposure. Our holistic approach to studying the plasma, the surface, and the gas-surface interface suggests a more thorough evaluation of plasma processing for NxOy emission control.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575710","","Chemistry;Surface morphology;Optical variables measurement;Plasmas;Kinetic theory;Optical films;Nitrogen;Climate change","catalysis;catalysts;decomposition;Fourier transform infrared spectra;nanostructured materials;nitrogen compounds;plasma chemistry;plasma diagnostics;reaction kinetics;scanning electron microscopy;surface chemistry;X-ray photoelectron spectra","vehicular emissions;inductively-coupled NxOy plasma systems;gas-surface interface reactions;gas-phase diagnostics;time-resolved optical emission data;NxOy source gases;steady-state emission;Ar emission lines;molecule formation pathways;gas phase density;gas mixture;surface chemistry;substrate morphology;plasma exposure;nitrogen oxide plasma chemistry;molecule decomposition pathways;noncatalytic substrates;X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy;scanning electron microscopy;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy;Si wafers;glass slides;platinium foil;gold thin films;zeolites;NxOy","","","","1","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modeling VLF wave phenomena in this environment remains a significant computational challenge because the characteristic frequencies of a plasma may be an order of magnitude higher than the VLF frequencies of interest. This discrepancy presents a significant problem for time-domain numerical solution methods such as finite difference time-domain (FDTD) because explicit time-stepping techniques are limited by the largest characteristic frequency present in the system. Another time-domain solution technique, called the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, does not suffer from these restrictions. Due to its different formulation, the DG method is easily adapted for use on unstructured grids, allowing for increased spatial resolution only where it is required.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575622","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1254365); University of Colorado Denver(grant numbers:1451210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575622","","Earth;Time-frequency analysis;Conferences;Plasmas;Numerical models;Time-domain analysis;Spatial resolution","finite difference time-domain analysis;Galerkin method","finite difference time-domain;explicit time-stepping techniques;time-domain solution technique;discontinuous Galerkin method;DG method;Hybrid Particle-In-Cell Simulation;wave-particle interactions;collisionless plasma;FD;DG schemes;plasma environment;Earth's magnetosphere;wave amplification phenomena;modeling VLF wave phenomena;time-domain numerical solution methods;frequency 3.0 kHz to 30.0 kHz","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, ethylene produced from the respiration process of agricultural products acts as a plant hormone that regulates the growth of plants such as seed germination and ripening. The increase in ethylene concentration in the storage facility significantly reduces the commercial value of agricultural products. The negative effects of ethylene include leaf yellowing, change in texture, and russet spotting. Even though there are several technologies available for controlling ethylene, practical applications are scarce. Non-thermal plasma process is a relatively new technology, in which ethylene is removed by a variety of plasma-induced reactive species. The plasma process has several advantages of high response speed and miniaturization of the system, while it has a poor selectivity to carbon dioxide and may generate harmful byproducts. Plasma-catalyst hybrid process has been actively studied as a method to overcome the disadvantages while maintaining the merits of the plasma treatment method. However, it is a great disadvantage to continuously supply electric energy for plasma generation. In this work, plasma/adsorption-catalytic process was investigated, which consists of repeated cycles of adsorption step to concentrate ethylene and plasma-catalyzed decomposition step. Since no electricity is used for the adsorption step, the operating cost can be greatly reduced and the adsorbed ethylene can be completely oxidized by the catalyst. The plasma reactor is filled with a catalytic adsorbent capable of highly concentrating ethylene. In the first step, ethylene is passed through the reactor to adsorb and concentrate ethylene, and in the next step, a high voltage is applied to the plasma reactor to rapidly decompose the previously adsorbed ethylene. The Ag/zeolite (or Pd/zeolite) catalytic adsorbent prepared by ion exchange method was found to be capable of efficiently adsorbing ethylene having high vapor pressure. When the catalytic adsorbent was directly exposed to the plasma discharge, plasma-induced reactive species accelerated the oxidation and increased the carbon dioxide yield in the decomposition step. The proposed ethylene treatment system was able to greatly reduce the ethylene oxidation time and ultimately the energy consumption. In addition, the cyclic treatment consisting of a long-time adsorption step and a short-time oxidation step led to a reduction in toxic by-products such as ozone and nitrogen-containing compounds as compared to typical continuous plasma treatment process.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575393","","Partial discharges;Adsorption;Plants (biology);Carbon dioxide;Oxidation;Agricultural products;Physiology","adsorption;agricultural products;agriculture;carbon compounds;catalysis;catalysts;decomposition;discharges (electric);energy consumption;ion exchange;nitrogen;organic compounds;oxidation;ozone;palladium;plasma applications;plasma chemistry;product quality;reduction (chemical);seeds (agriculture);silver;storage;zeolites","metabolic processes;respiration process;agricultural products;ethylene concentration;nonthermal plasma process;plasma-induced reactive species;plasma-catalyst hybrid process;plasma treatment method;plasma generation;plasma-catalyzed decomposition step;ethylene adsorption;plasma reactor;plasma discharge;ethylene treatment system;ethylene oxidation time;typical continuous plasma treatment process;post-harvest agricultural storage;cyclic operation;plasma-adsorption-catalytic process;physiological responses;quality changes;ripening;plant hormone;plants growth;seed germination;commercial value;leaf yellowing;texture change;russet spotting;carbon dioxide;harmful byproducts;electric energy supply;concentrate ethylene;zeolite;catalytic adsorbent;ion exchange method;energy consumption;toxic by-products reduction;ozone;nitrogen-containing compounds;Ag;Pd;CO2;O3;N2","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cathode was shielded by a set of chevron baffles defining a primary arc chamber between the main chamber walls and the chevron baffle screen. In addition, the auxiliary mid anode in the form of a rectangular plate was positioned in the middle between the chevron baffle screen and the remote anode. The current-voltage characteristics of this discharge, obtained by modeling and experimental evaluation, have demonstrated that, in comparison to low pressure glow discharge, the electron emission mechanisms (thermionic emission vs. secondary emission), as well as boundary conditions on the discharge tube walls, strongly influence both the plasma distribution and the electrical characteristics of the remote arc discharge [2], [3]. It was found that the proximate mid anode can promote the ignition of the long remote arc discharge between the cathode and the distant remote anode in cascaded arc form. The primary arc plasma generated within the cathode chamber diffuses throughout the baffle screen, forming a plasma cloud in the entire discharge tube with decreasing electron density from the baffle screen toward the remote anode, while the plasma potential increases rapidly at the baffle screen-to-remote arc plasma interface, with plasma potential in the cathode chamber defined by a typical vacuum arc voltage drop of ~20-25V, while in remote arc plasma area it is closely matching the anode potential. The modeling of the cascaded low pressure remote arc discharge was performed in drift-diffusion approximation using Plasma Module of COMSOL Multiphysics FEM commercial software package [4]. It appears that the breakdown of the remote arc discharge is due to resistance heating of electrons within the tail of diffused plasma propagating from the cathode chamber across the baffled screen toward the remote anode when the positive potential is applied either to mid anode or to remote anode or to both anodes.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575866","","Electric potential;Thermionic emission;Arc discharges;Vacuum technology;Discharges (electric);Plasmas;Electron tubes","argon;cathodes;electron density;electron emission;finite element analysis;glow discharges;plasma density;plasma deposition;plasma diagnostics;plasma materials processing;plasma production;plasma simulation;plasma sources;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes;plasma-wall interactions;thermionic emission;vacuum arcs","plasma potential increases;baffle screen-to-remote arc plasma interface;typical vacuum arc voltage drop;anode potential;remote arc plasma discharge;pressure range;long rectangular chamber;planar vacuum arc cathode;cathodic arc spots;rectangular plate;chevron baffles;primary arc chamber;main chamber walls;chevron baffle screen;low pressure glow discharge;discharge tube walls;distant remote anode;cascaded arc form;primary arc plasma;entire discharge tube;low pressure remote arc discharge;cathode chamber diffusion;electron emission mechanism;thermionic emission;plasma distribution;electrical characteristics;COMSOL Multiphysics FEM commercial software package;voltage 20.0 V to 25.0 V;pressure 1 mtorr to 25 mtorr","","","","4","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hansen's invention of the MARK I electron linear accelerator at Stanford utilizing RF resonant cavities and powered by the klystron that had recently been invented by the Varian brothers. In the ensuing 75 years accelerators have become an engine of scientific discovery leading to experimental verification of the Standard Model for particle physics; to xray free-electron lasers for ultra-fast chemical and materials science; and to applications such as radiation oncology, industrial processing, and national security. The tremendous development of accelerator technology over the last half-century has even capitalized on developments such as superconducting RF technology to enable very high average power operation. We now find ourselves at the point where the current technology can no longer deliver the desired performance required in the future at a cost that is acceptable and within the desired size and power constraints. Understanding the coupling of particle beams, electromagnetic fields, materials properties, and plasmas underpins the future of accelerator science and technology. Exciting R&D is underway in numerous areas that has the promise of greatly increasing the science reach of high-energy physics accelerators as well as enabling a broad range of applications for smaller and even compact accelerators in areas that include industrial processing, medical, security, and others.

Plasmas have the ability to convert gaseous hydrocarbons and CO2 into liquid products while relying on any (renewable) source of electricity-rather than heat-and maintain a high operation(al) flexibility. These merits make it a dream technology for GTL and storing intermittent sustainable energy in chemicals and fuels3, One of the main remaining challenges is to increase the (liquid) product selectivity and yield. To overcome this issue, most research focuses on the physics and engineering side, particularly in combination with catalysts (plasma catalysis).

The electron energy distribution function (EEDF) has direct impact on the rate coefficient of electron impact reactions and further on the plasma properties. Coupling a Boltzmann equation solver (BOLOS3) with the KGMf can capture the EEDF changes in time, which makes the simulation results more physically reasonable but simulation times longer.

One of the greatest challenges in generating a non-thermal plasma is producing an electric field sufficiently large to generate breakdown in atmospheric air. Piezoelectric transformers are solid state transformers that can produce large gains in voltage which has made them attractive candidates for plasma production. In this work, the electrical and optical characteristics of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) generated from a piezoelectric transformer were measured. With the piezoelectric transformer, plasma jets were produced with input voltages as low as 10 V and applied powers of less than 0.5 W. The piezoelectric driven jet was compared to an APPJ produced with a high voltage sinewave of comparable frequency to piezoelectric transformers optimal operating frequency. Both APPJs were examined in helium and argon for a variety of different flow rates and operating voltages. The length of the jets were nearly identical for all operating parameters with argon feed-gas but differed when helium used. In addition, measured current waveforms using the different approaches varied and optical emission spectroscopy showed a greater relative number of molecular nitrogen lines but lower relative emission of atomic oxygen lines for the piezoelectric transformer produced jet compared to the high voltage sinewave produced jet. Together, the results suggest the piezoelectric material has an influence beyond simple voltage amplification.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575675","","Integrated optics;Atomic measurements;Plasma jets;Atmospheric measurements;Atom optics;High-voltage techniques;Optical variables measurement","argon;helium;nitrogen;oxygen;piezoelectricity;plasma diagnostics;plasma jets;plasma materials processing;plasma production;plasma sources;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes;transformers","high voltage sinewave;piezoelectric transformers optimal operating frequency;APPJ;piezoelectric transformer;atmospheric pressure plasma jet;nonthermal atmospheric pressure plasma technology;atmospheric air;solid state transformers;plasma production;plasma jets;piezoelectric driven jet;electrical characteristics;input voltage;optical characteristics;flow rates;optical emission spectroscopy;simple voltage amplification;piezoelectric material;molecular nitrogen lines;atomic oxygen lines;pressure 1.0 atm;He;O2;N2;Ar","","","","0","USGov","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In collision driven ionization this typically means maximizing the applied electric field. We perform PIC simulations1 of Argon plasma near 1 Torr on nanosecond time scales. Unexpected secondary ionization is found to occur in pulsed argon discharges subsequent to voltage pulse termination between planar electrodes. The secondary ionization, which occurs at the falling edge of the voltage pulse, is induced by charge separation in the bulk plasma region. This process occurs on nanosecond time scales and is driven by a reverse in the electric field from the cathode sheath to the formerly driven anode. Under the influence of the reverse electric field, electrons in the bulk plasma and sheath regions are accelerated toward the cathode. This electron movement manifests itself as a strong electron current generating high electron energies with significant electron dissipated power. Accelerated electrons collide with Ar molecules and an increased ionization rate is achieved even though the driving voltage is no longer applied. The secondary ionization phenomena bears some resemblance to secondary discharges observed in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) experiments2. However, in those cases, the energy reservoir are the polarized electrodes and not the bulk plasma itself. The results suggest that more elaborate pulse designs can be used to condition plasma density and temperature as required for fast discharge applications.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575244","U.S. DOE(grant numbers:DE-FG02-03ER54725); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575244","","Ionization;Voltage;Reservoirs;Discharges (electric);Plasmas;Argon;Electric fields","argon;discharges (electric);electron density;ionisation;plasma applications;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes","unexpected post-pulse secondary ionization;nanosecond pulsed discharges;plasma applications;plasma electron density;applied electric field;PIC simulations;Argon plasma;1 Torr;nanosecond time scales;unexpected secondary ionization;pulsed argon;voltage pulse termination;planar electrodes;bulk plasma region;cathode sheath;driven anode;reverse electric field;sheath regions;electron movement;strong electron current;high electron energies;accelerated electrons collide;ionization rate;driving voltage;secondary ionization phenomena;secondary discharges;dielectric barrier discharge experiments;pulse designs;condition plasma density;electron dissipated power;pressure 1.0 torr;Ar","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was found that the convergence of the SW generated by an exploding array in glycerol is significantly faster than in water. Increasing the initially stored energy (for identical array diameters) or decreasing the sphere diameter (for identical stored energy) leads to an increase in parameters of compressed liquid in the vicinity of the implosion.3 These results are compared with the underwater electrical explosions of SWA on the sub-us-timescale. The time-of-flight of the SW convergence was found to be the same, despite the almost 4 times faster energy density deposition for the shorter timescale. This phenomenon is reproduced by HD modeling showing that the exploding wires' expansion on both timescales results in identical radii when the convergence of the SW becomes self-similar. Thus, to increase the parameters of the compressed water, instead of increasing the energy deposition rate, one must increase the stored energy.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575554","","Pulse generation;Liquids;Conferences;Wires;Predictive models;Adiabatic;Explosions","exploding wires;explosions;explosives;organic compounds;plasma diagnostics;plasma shock waves;water;wires (electric);Z pinch","identical stored energy;compressed liquid;underwater electrical explosion;SW convergence;energy density deposition;exploding wires;timescales;compressed water;wires arrays;glycerol;spherical wire array;adiabatic compression;HD modeling;underwater cylindrical wire arrays;initial azimuthal nonsymmetry;uniform implosion;liquid compression;electrical explosions;SWA arrays;pulse generator;sphere diameters;exploding array;initially stored energy;identical array diameters;shockwave;size 30.0 mum","","","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The vexing challenge to the utility of these plasma processing reactors is the existence of the E-H mode transition1. Industry notably avoids the process region associated with this transition, where plasma instabilities prohibit reliable RF power delivery. The plasma instability is associated with a hysteresis in coupled RF power (current) varying for the E-Mode, or weakly capacitive coupling to the plasma, in comparison to the stronger current coupling in the H-Mode, where inductive coupling is preferentially dominant. As a result, approximately two orders of magnitude of electron density is relinquished in this transition region from serving industrial manufacturing processes. We characterize the plasma parameter variation through the E to H-mode with a time-resolved measurement of the electron density. Electropositive and electronegative chemistries are incorporated into our experimental setup. The experimental scheme serves to evaluate RF power delivery and ameliorate its coupling through the transition region. The work is further extended to adopt more efficient power coupling to toroidal plasma sources.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575529","","Couplings;Radio frequency;Semiconductor device measurement;Manufacturing processes;Density measurement;Semiconductor devices;Plasma measurements","electron density;high-frequency discharges;plasma density;plasma devices;plasma diagnostics;plasma instability;plasma materials processing;plasma simulation;plasma sources;plasma temperature","time-resolved electron density measurement characterization;E-H modes;low pressure regimes;high-volume manufacturing;semiconductor devices;vexing challenge;E-H mode transition;process region;plasma instability;RF power delivery;coupled RF power;weakly capacitive coupling;stronger current coupling;transition region;industrial manufacturing processes;plasma parameter variation;time-resolved measurement;efficient power coupling;toroidal plasma sources;inductively coupled plasma sources;reliable RF power delivery;electropositive chemistry;electronegative chemistry","","","","1","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The wide range of ion energy fluxes makes it a distinctive technique for the deposition of hard composite-films (CF). This abstract is the review of work done by our team for the application of PF for hard coatings. This abstract demonstrates the deposition of nano-structured MP-ZrAlO, P-ZrON, NC-ZrO2, the influence of annealing temperature (AT) on the surface properties of P-ZrON and C-SiON CF by PF. Analysis reveals that the structural (crystallite size, crystallinity etc), morphological (shape, size and distribution of nano-particles) and mechanical properties like microhardness of these CF are associated with the increase of number of focus shots (FS), sample axial and angular positions and AT. The analysis of MP-ZrAlO CF reveals that better crystallinity of m-ZrO2 and c-ZrO2 phases is achieved at 300°C AT, while the re-crystallization of all phases except m-ZrO2 (111) phase is observed at 600°C AT. The thickness of C-SiON CF deposited for 50 FS is found to ~ 15.47 $\mu \mathrm{m}$. The microhardness of MP-ZrAlO CF deposited for 25 FS is found to be $9.14\pm 0.35$ GPa which is seven times than the microhardness of virgin Zr. The micro-hardness $(8.6\pm 0.64$ MPa) of P-ZrON CF deposited at 1.5 mbar NP is found to be four times the micro-hardness of virgin Zr. The microhardness of zirconia film deposited for 25 FS is found to be 10.6 $\pm 0.51$ GPa. The microhardness of P-ZrON CF annealed at 500°C is found to be 11.9 GPa which is 7.8 times that of virgin Zr. The mechanical analysis reveals that the increase in micro-hardness of P-ZrON CF is due to the (i) increased nitrogen content, (ii) lattice distortion, (iii) grain boundary mobility, and (iv) texture coefficient. In short, the transfer of $E$ and $P$ of energetic $\mathrm{N}$ ions to the substrate surface leads to an increase in the adatom mobility, which enhances the crystallinity and hence the film becomes highly textured which also hinders the mobility of grain boundaries which in turn increases the microhardness. On the basis of these analyses, we may say that PF is a simple and versatile deposition technique for depositing highly textured films which shows high microhardness.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575227","","Grain boundaries;Zirconium;Annealing;Surface morphology;Ions;Mechanical factors;Plasmas","annealing;carbon;crystallites;grain boundaries;microhardness;nanocomposites;nanofabrication;nanoparticles;particle size;phosphorus;plasma accelerators;plasma deposition;plasma focus;recrystallisation;reviews;silicon compounds;surface morphology;texture;thin films;zirconium compounds","plasma focus;hard composite films;coaxial plasma accelerator;ion energy flux;annealing;microhardness;review;crystallite;nanoparticles;recrystallization;lattice distortion;grain boundary mobility;texture coefficient;surface morphology;particle size distribution;temperature 300.0 degC;temperature 600.0 degC;temperature 500.0 degC;pressure 1.5 mbar;P-ZrON;C-SiON;ZrAlO","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furuya","Faculty of Engineering, Saitama Institute of Technology, Fukaya, Saitama, JAPAN","2018 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)","1 Nov 2021","2018","","","1","1","Triboluminescence is a luminous phenomenon resulted from friction; for example, peeling scotch tape, breaking rock sugar with a hammer, peeling mica and so on. Triboluminescence is well known over 50 years but in 2008 UCLA group reported the radiation of x-ray region by triboluminescence in vacuum for the first time1. UCLA group made an automatic machine which peels scotch tape. With a view to practical application of triboluminescence to roentgen diagnosis we made an automatic peeling machine similar to that of UCLA group. An x-ray tube for conventional roentgen diagnosis needs a high voltage power supply. In contrast, triboluminescence does not need it. So it is very useful for roentgen diagnosis to replace a conventional x-ray tube with triboluminescence. Thus far, we have attempted to confirm the x-ray generation from triboluminescence using a filtered phosphor screen when the parameters such as the followings are changed; peeling speed, atmospheric pressure, variety of scotch tape, emission angle etc. Then in a similar way we have also attempted to measure x-ray dose from triboluminescence using a potable dosemeter. It was found that the x-ray generation has a directional property. Because the method to peel scotch tapes does not enable to operate continuously, new method without scotch tapes has been proposed2 – 3. The new method repeatedly contacts silicone with epoxy to produce x-ray. In this conference, we have reported a novel method to generate xray radiation by triboluminescence. Two circular discs are co ntacted and rotated: The discs are made of different materials. We have made a new-type triboluminescence equipment and examined its characteristics when the following conditions are changed; combinations of contact materials, rotating velo city, radiation direction, pressure and so on.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575708","","Atmospheric measurements;Power supplies;Urban areas;Phosphors;High-voltage techniques;Rocks;Electron tubes","phosphors;resins;triboluminescence;X-ray detection;X-ray tubes","repetitive triboluminescence;scotch tape;2008 UCLA group;roentgen diagnosis;automatic peeling machine;x-ray tube;x-ray generation;new-type triboluminescence equipment;X-Ray Source","","","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Characteristics of these vortices have been studied as the transmission line impedance profile changes; specifically, the threshold impedance for vortex formation and vortex dynamics. The impedance change is caused by a radius change, either by step change or a linear transition. The effects of adding only a simple diffuser section (radial A-K gap increases in the direction of flow) and only a simple baffle section (radial A-K gap decreases in the direction of flow) are reported. Once vortex formation is achieved, the threshold radius step and gradient at which steady state flow is eventually attainable is reported.

The long timescale turbulence behavior of the system is determined by extrapolating forward in time using estimates of the macroscales obtained from short duration simulations of the microscale dynamics. In our EFPI simulations, the heat flux of the turbulence will slowly vary by way of a time varying source. We will compare directly to turbulence simulations without EFPI.

However, there is a lack of understanding in their relative concentrations, penetration depth, and effective reaction rates, and how they affect the chemistry in the liquid phase; often, properties are drawn from different systems, without a thorough understanding of their transferability.

Here we report the simulation work using a FDTD code to study the behavior of a circular plasma tube array as an antenna reflector for simple beam switching. The plasma tube array is constructed by 48 plasma tubes forming a 30 cm diameter cylinder, and each tube is built with 60 cm long, 10 mm diameter glass tube containing Ar plus minute Hg plasma excited by either a 60 Hz or 22 KHz high voltage pulse. The plasma density is around 1011–1012 cm-3. Sections of the array can be switched on and off to direct the radiation coming out of a metal dipole antenna situated at the center of the cylinder to desired direction. Far field radiation pattern and near field electric field are calculated. Results indicate the operating frequency has strong effect on the switched beam pattern not only because of its relationship to the $\omega_{pe}$, the relative size of wavelength to the reflector is also very influential. The reflector has to be much larger than the dipole antenna inside the cylinder to form a good switched beam pattern.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575207","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.(grant numbers:106-2221-E-161-002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575207","","Particle beams;Radar cross-sections;Dipole antennas;Switches;Reflector antennas;Radar antennas;Plasmas","antenna radiation patterns;argon;dipole antennas;finite difference time-domain analysis;mercury (metal);plasma density;plasma electromagnetic wave propagation;radar antennas;radar cross-sections;reflector antennas","metal dipole antenna;operating frequency;FDTD simulation;circular plasma tube array;antenna reflector;characteristic frequency;plasma reflector;corner reflector;radar cross section reduction;glass tube;plasma density;electromagnetic wave;Ar plus minute Hg plasma;far field radiation pattern;near field electric field;switched beam pattern;size 30.0 cm;size 60.0 cm;size 10.0 mm;frequency 60.0 Hz;frequency 22.0 kHz;Ar;Hg","","","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ion flux from the source region is found to be approximately the Bohm flux and the continuity equation requires that the particle flux within a magnetic flux tube be constant. The mirror force converts upstream thermal energy of both species into energy in the ion flow speed downstream. The downstream ion flow speed is about 1.5 times the ion sound speed for large expansion ratios.

When the accident occurs in power system such as lightning surge, short-circuit fault or grand fault, the fault current brings about instantaneous voltage drop. The economy would be badly damaged by this phenomenon. Therefore, it is important to interrupt the arc as soon as possible. The GCB (Gas Circuit Breaker) has been researched for performance to interrupt the arc more quickly and clearly. However, the serious problem of thermal re-ignition occurs after interruption of the arc. This is caused by TRV (Transient Recovery Voltage). It is mainly considered that the factor of thermal re-ignition is the arc temperature. This is because the arc conductivity depends on arc temperature. Therefore, it can be estimated that the quick arc temperature decrement contributes to improvement of the arc braking performance. In this paper, the decrement of the arc conductance affected by the gas flow late to the axial center in the gas circuit breaker was elucidated. In this calculation, gas bluster shape was changed as a parameter in order to calculate the arc conductance and temperature distribution. As a result, the arc conductance decreased with increasing the gas flow rate to the axial center. This is because that the nozzle throat inlet is set upper middle part and outlet downstream is set between electrodes. Therefore, the gas flow late to the axial center plays an important role for decrement of the arc conductance.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575277","","Temperature distribution;Temperature dependence;Circuit breakers;Fluid flow;Voltage;Power systems;Circuit faults","circuit-breaking arcs;fault currents;gas blast circuit breakers;ignition;nozzles;temperature distribution","power system;short-circuit fault;gas circuit breaker;thermal re-ignition;arc conductivity;quick arc temperature decrement;arc braking performance;arc conductance;axial center;gas flow rate;electric power;power generation;distribution system;nozzle throat;power transmission;lightning surge;grand fault;fault current;transient recovery voltage;temperature distribution","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present results on the effect of strong impulse electric fields and discharges on the inactivation degree of E. coli bacteria in drinking and waste water. We use a Marx generator with maximum output voltage of ~ 1 00 kV as an energy source. The pulse duration $(0.3 < \tau < 3\mu \mathrm{s})$ and pulse front (~ 20 ns) were adjusted by varying the capacity of the discharge circuit and shortening the pulses in the output of the generator [2]. We used a pin-plane electrode system, with pin electrodes of both polarities. We find that high voltage pulses of positive polarity are a more effective pulsed mode, because of a higher rate of physical processes and rapid breakdown of water gap. Also, shortening the pulse front facilitates the penetration of the high-frequency electric field directly into the nuclei of biological cells. Microbiological analysis shows that the concentration of E. coli bacteria in treated water decreases from ~108 CFU/cm3 to ~103 CFU/cm3 after 1000 discharges at a voltage of ~45 kV and positive polarity of the pin electrode. The results of the experiments and calculations confirm the chosen functional dependence of energy released into water on parameters of electrode system.

However, the chemically non-equilibrium is remarkable at the current interruption. In addition, the thermal nonequilibrium should be considered in the post arc. In this paper, the energy conservation law was analyzed by separating the energy conservation of electron and energy conservation of heavy particle. For this reason, the calculation of reaction rate needs the electron temperature and the gas temperature in order to analyze the current interruption considering chemically non-equilibrium. As a result, the electron temperature is higher than the gas temperature near the cathode at the arc periphery. In addition, the validity of the electron temperature and the gas temperature was confirmed.

Textiles and polymer films have been highly considered for EM shielding applications due to their desirable properties in terms of flexibility, low mass and low cost. In this study, we suggest the process to coat metal nanoparticles on flexible polymer film using underwater plasma. The suggested process has advantages of fast fabrication time and simple system because it can synthesize and coat metal nanoparticles at one time.

The device is fabricated from a Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) and can be varied in both discharge width (0.2-5 cm) and gap (0.1-3 mm). The two silver metal electrodes for the discharge are completely covered with a 35 μm layer of LTCC. Multiple CAP sources can be stacked together to produce arrays of sources. Mass flow controllers allow argon and oxygen to flow between the plates during the discharge. The CAP plasma has been shown to completely remove 4-day E. coli 0157:H7 biofilms from glass coverslips and kill Staph. aureus cells in 2-day biofilms. Channels etched in the biofilm have been measured with a stylus profilometer and indicate removal rates of > 50 nm/s.

The most common process of ammonia production is the Haber-Bosh (H-B) process, a well-optimized method that requires high temperature (~ 700 K) and pressure (~ 1 00 atm) to operate under equilibrium conditions (using thermal catalysis). Alternatively, ammonia can be produced less efficiently close to standard conditions by combining non-thermal plasmas and catalysts (plasma catalysis). Unlike thermal catalysis, in plasma catalysis the non-equilibrium state of the plasma $(T_{electrons}\gg T_{ions},T_{neutrals}$ produces reactive species, such as excited species, that may play an important role in the production of ammonia. The interaction between the plasma and the catalyst can be characterized in two categories: the effect of the plasma on catalysis and the effect of the catalyst on the plasma state. This work focuses on the latter. We use a laboratory-scale, packed bed, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor to investigate the effects of different supported metal catalysts on the plasma. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and electrical measurements are used to estimate various system parameters, including rotational and vibrational temperatures and electron densities, for various supported catalyst configurations (e.g., alumina supported nickel). These parameters are correlated with measurements of ammonia synthesis under identical conditions to assess whether there are significant differences in the plasma under conditions where ammonia synthesis is enhanced.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575672","","Temperature measurement;Ammonia;Catalysts;Production;Optical variables measurement;Plasma measurements;Plasmas","ammonia;catalysis;catalysts;chemical reactors;dielectric-barrier discharges;electron density;organic compounds;plasma chemistry","packed-bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor;ammonia synthesis;alternative fuel;renewable energy technologies;equilibrium conditions;thermal catalysis;plasma catalysis;nonequilibrium state;supported metal catalysts;vibrational temperatures;electron densities;fertilizers;Haber-Bosh process;nonthermal plasmas;DBD;optical emission spectroscopy;OES;electrical measurements;rotational temperatures;NH3","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The finite difference (FD) weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with artificial resistivity was used to solve this system. In order to avoid the artificial diffusion and reduce error, in this work, we would like to use the scheme in [2] to solve the HJ equation, which relies on a special kernel-based formulation of the solutions and successive convolution. A high order WENO integration and a nonlinear filter will help us to capture the correct viscosity solution. Moreover, a positivity-preserving property is used as a limiter.

A collection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RON), charged ions, and several other particles impinge onto an object to sterilize the surface. A novel geometrical actuator configuration within a cylindrical structure is evaluated in this study to observe whether an increase in mixing is possible. Exposed electrode numbers of 1, 2, 3, and 6 were tested and associated to their respective degree of mixing. The same actuators were then tested on a five-strain mixture of Salmonella enterica subspecies to observe their degree of population reduction. The increase of induced airflow of SDBD actuators with increased numbers of electrodes correlates with increased bacterial inactivation. These results suggest that by improving the particle velocity, airflow mixing tendencies, and plasma volume at the same power inputs results in increased surface decontamination efficiency.

However, high liquid conductivity in some waste water can influence the electrical breakdown at a gas-liquid interface and thereby influence the formation of hydroxyl radicals causing reduced water treatment efficiency. In the current study, we used a nanosecond pulsed power supply with a water film plasma reactor to investigate the influence of liquid conductivity on the electrical breakdown, H2O2 formation, and plasma properties, including the electron density, gas temperature, and electron temperature. The liquid conductivity of water was adjusted by adding potassium chloride. Both argon and helium were used as the carrier gas, and the sensitivity of both argon and helium discharges to the liquid conductivity were compared. The results show that the H2O2 production rate drops 5% and 10% for argon and helium discharges, respectively. The electron density slightly increases while the electron temperature decreases as the liquid conductivity was increased from $5\mu \mathrm{S}/\text{cm}$ to 40mS/cm. This result is correlated with the increase of current dissipation in the water as the liquid conductivity was increased. However, the reactor/power supply system has a high tolerance to liquid conductivity and can generate a strong discharge when the liquid conductivity is as high as 40 mS/ cm, This result suggests that the system has potential for treating sea water. In comparison with our previous study2, it is shown here that a nanosecond pulsed plasma discharge has a much better liquid conductivity tolerance than the microsecond pulsed discharge.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575293","NSF(grant numbers:CBET:1702166); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575293","","Temperature sensors;Liquids;Electric breakdown;Conductivity;Water pollution;Plasmas;Helium","discharges (electric);electron density;hydrogen compounds;organic compounds;oxidation;oxygen;plasma applications;plasma chemistry;plasma diagnostics;plasma materials processing;plasma temperature;pulsed power supplies;wastewater treatment;water;water treatment","argon;helium discharges;nanosecond pulsed plasma discharge;liquid conductivity tolerance;electrical breakdown;nonthermal plasma generated;water film plasma reactor;nonthermal plasma technology;liquid conductivity;gas-liquid interface;reduced water treatment efficiency","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intense neutrino beams are present in astrophysical plasmas and are responsible for various phenomena such as heating of type II supernovae. The investigation of neutrino properties is a most relevant issue in context of elementary particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics. The confirmation of neutrino masses and flavor oscillations draw attention towards the incompleteness of the standard model and call for a new description of nature. Since the ion acoustic waves as well as neutrino flavor oscillations are both slow in character, the coupling between neutrino and plasma oscillations is a very interesting phenomenon to investigate. The intense interactions between IAWs and flavor oscillations give rise to plasma instabilities. Such an instability may be a suitable mechanism for supernova explosions that are an abundant source of neutrinos. Recently reported investigations have illustrated the growth rate of linear plasma instabilities while considering the neutrino mass oscillation model linked to the neutrino-plasma coupling model in a usual electron-ion plasma. However, the different types of plasma instabilities arising due to coupling of slow mode waves and neutrino flavor oscillations in magnetized, dense plasmas have not been fully scrutinized. Our aim is to remove this lacuna and investigate the plasma instabilities such as Jeans instability, while taking into account the breakthrough discovery of neutrino flavor oscillations. The findings of present investigation may give interesting physical insights into the complex astrophysical phenomenon in dense plasmas of stellar, white dwarf, red giant, and supernova stars.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575960","","Couplings;Heating systems;Particle beams;Neutrino sources;Magnetoacoustic effects;Ions;Plasmas","astrophysical plasma;cosmology;flavour model;neutrino interactions;neutrino mass;neutrino oscillations;neutrinos;plasma instability;plasma ion acoustic waves;plasma oscillations;supernovae;white dwarfs","plasma instabilities due;ion acoustic waves;neutrino oscillations;neutrino flavor oscillations;intense neutrino beams;neutrino properties;neutrino masses;plasma oscillations;linear plasma instabilities;neutrino mass oscillation model;neutrino-plasma coupling model;usual electron-ion plasma","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These devices contain metallic surfaces that serve as the source of unwanted particles released into vacuum. The primary culprits are desorbed gas molecules and secondary electrons. Outgassing results from stimulated or thermal desorption of molecular species in metals and can lead to undesired plasma formation in the vacuum gap. Secondary electrons (SEs) can lead to the multipactor effect when an avalanche of SEs obtain resonance with the internal RF field. Here we discuss surface treatments for mitigating these problems. Laser surface melting (LSM) entails irradiating a metallic sample with the output of a high energy, continuous laser beam, thereby causing melting, flow and re-solidification of the material. LSM processing reduces H outgassing by decreasing the number of grain boundaries through which H can diffuse. We have demonstrated a 50x reduction over an untreated stainless steel surface1. For SE reduction, both surface roughening and patterning have been investigated. Surface roughening was accomplished by using specific grades of metallographic polishing pads imparting controlled levels of roughness and surface features. Electron beam bombardment experiments showed that the secondary electron yield (SEY) increased with surface roughening2. Surface patterning with micro-pores has also been shown to reduce SEY. Modeling has shown that the amount of reduction depends on the aspect ratio of the pore (the ratio of the pore height to the pore diameter), with the greatest reductions occurring for aspect ratios less than two. In order to validate these models, a variety of micro-porous gold surfaces were designed and fabricated using photolithography and electroplating processes, and the models were validated with experimental results3, These results will be discussed.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575895","","Radio frequency;Vacuum systems;Vacuum breakdown;Surface emitting lasers;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Plasmas","diffusion;electroplating;gold;grain boundaries;laser sintering;melt processing;outgassing;photolithography;polishing;porous materials;reduction (chemical);secondary electron emission;solidification;stainless steel;surface roughness","hydrogen outgassing;secondary electron emission;metallic surfaces;continuous laser beam;untreated stainless steel surface;surface roughening;roughness;electron beam bombardment;secondary electron yield;surface patterning;reduction;microporous gold surfaces;laser surface melting;flow;re-solidification;grain boundaries;metallographic polishing pads;photolithography;electroplating;multipactor;vacuum breakdown;H;Au","","","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, in this study, polythiophene films are directly deposited on substrates with interdigitated electrodes by APPJs and their gas sensing properties are investigated. This plasma polymerization technique can be used to synthesize the poly- and single-crystalline high-density thin films with nanoparticles by enhancing the sufficient nucleation and recombination.

To this end, a simplified model3 of the thruster consisting of two rectangular electrodes on alumina ceramic plate with interelectrode gap covered by carbon paint is considered. It is shown that after optimizing the inter-electrode gap, electrical power and the value of magnetic field, such “idealized” thruster model can provide up to 1.2-1.3 million pulses with the high degree of stability of ignition and amplitude of arc current. These findings may be used in designing of micro-cathode thrusters with the rigidly fixed, unmovable electrodes.

The spatial-resolved optical imaging shows that a ring-shaped profile is observed in the samples treated close to the nozzle with He APPJ, while no ring-shaped profile is observed with increasing O2 additive. The plasma-surface contact area reduces by increasing O2 concentration. The optical emissions of reactive oxygen nitrogen species (RONS) are enhanced significantly at the plasma/surface interfacial regions as compared with those of free jet region. The emission spectra indicates that there is a relative optimum fraction of O2 in the He/02 gas mixture from 0 to 1.5% for the relative larger intensity of the characteristic atomic oxygen line at 777 nm. The fluid model is used to provide insight into the effect of O2 admixture on the discharge dynamics and the reaction pathways that lead to the production and destruction of the dominant reactive oxygen species.

It is expected to illuminate landmark at the evacuation, supporting the rescue operation and shelter lightning. However, the light of the HID lamp is red and blueish white color. People, especially victims, were not satisfied with the color. Thus, improvement of color rendering, radiation power and lamp efficiency are requested at the HID lamp. Lamp efficiency is easy to increase as function of current. However, it is difficult to cope with both of color rendering and lamp efficiency. Therefore, this study chased the best pattern in wall-stabilized arc of water-cooled vortex type. The improvement of color rendering was limited because of bluish white light made by combination of line spectrum. The broad spectrum emitted from the continuous spectrum is needed for improvement of the color rendering spectrum. The continuous spectrum is obtained at 15000 K in Ar. Because the recombination radiation of Ar ions are dominant. Previous research has been elucidated in order to that radiation power is improved by the appropriate controlling temperature volume distribution. Thus, it is necessary to control the temperature distribution in order to obtain the temperature distribution with high radiation efficiency. Therefore the lump efficiency and color rending as function item of temperature effect and volume effect in wall-stabilized arc of water-cooled vortex type is elucidated by the experiment and theoretical simulation. As a result, the current, the wall radius and the inter-electrode distance can control the arc temperature and volume.

While radial variations in the plasma flow velocity that occur on the pinch-size scale $a$ can indeed generate sufficient phase-mixing for the stabilization of large-scale (k~ 1/a) MHD modes, weaker short-scale drift-wave instabilities that occur on a much smaller ion gyroradius scale are less affected by the large-scale velocity shear. Left behind, the drift microturbulence can substantially enhance classical (collisional) transport coefficient including plasma viscosity and can act over time to reduce the velocity shear and degrade the confinement. In this paper we present the initial results from gyrokintic simulations aimed to assess the influence of the ion gyro-scale drift microturbulence on the stability and transport properties of FSZP systems.

The ablated mass is ionized through collisions with gas molecules, producing a plasma around the meteoroid which is visible to radar systems as a head echo. Radar observations of meteor head echoes play an important role in constraining the total mass of cosmic dust that is entering Earth's atmosphere. The nature of meteor head echoes is heavily influenced by the processes of ionization, heating, and drag that occur in meteor entry. To investigate these aspects of meteor ablation, experiments have been undertaken using the University of Colorado's 3 MV hypervelocity dust accelerator facility. U sing the accelerator, dust particles were shot at speeds of 1 - 70 km/s into an air chamber containing various gases held at pressures of 0.01 - 0.2 Torr to create simulated meteors. The air chamber contained multiple charge collectors to observe the charge production by the particles as they interacted with gas molecules and ablated. Experiments with iron and aluminum particles have determined the probability that an atom ablated from a meteor will produce an ion-electron pair, which is a steep function of velocity. Spatial observations of the charge production of iron and aluminum have been used to study the heating and ablation that meteors undergo when they enter an atmosphere. Further experiments with aluminum have investigated the drag that meteors experience, which is essential to understand in order to predict the amount of ionization that a meteor will produce. Observations of drag also act to constrain the total heating that meteors experience, and lend insight into the microphysical processes that occur during micrometeoroid entry into the atmosphere. Differential ablation has also been investigated, in which complex olivine and magnesite particles were observed to ablate more volatile elements before less volatile elements.

This power coupling through different parametrically induced waves can yield very high density plasma and self-focused ion beam. Unlike PIC/MCC or hybrid fluid, here the FEM based fluid model uses time dependent Poisson solver through drift-diffusion approach. Results demonstrate that the pumping wave (2.45GHz) energy decays through electron cyclotron resonance (ECR), scattered upper hybrid (UH)/electron Bernstein wave (EBW), polarization reversal and ion type waves(i.e., Ion Bernstein wave (IBW),Ion Acoustic Wave (IAW), Electrostatic Ion cyclotron wave(EICW)) respectively with the advancement of time of MW launching. ECR based power absorption takes place up to 5 $\mu \mathrm{s}$, till it reaches the critical density. The energy channeling through different waves is determined by the plasma density gradient, the pump wave $\tilde{E}$ -field strength and its distribution within the cavity. The MW power absorption through UH/EBW starts occurring mainly from time t = ~ $40 \mu \mathrm{s}$ onwards since the initiation of plasma breakdown time. The change in guided-wave mode (m = +1 to -1, polarization reversal) frequency from low to high, comes into play from time $\mathrm{t}=\sim 25\mu \mathrm{s}$ at the polarization reversal point which is affected by E- field, magnetic field gradient, and the radial boundary condition. The theoretically obtained $\tilde{\mathrm{E}}$ -field was compared with the experimentally obtained EICWs intensity lines.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575606","","Couplings;Microwave integrated circuits;Time-frequency analysis;Fluids;Absorption;Discharges (electric);Plasmas","cyclotron resonance;high-frequency discharges;plasma Bernstein waves;plasma density;plasma electromagnetic wave propagation;plasma ion acoustic waves;plasma radiofrequency heating;plasma temperature;plasma toroidal confinement;Tokamak devices","electric field;power coupling mechanisms;off-resonance microwave discharge;power coupling processes;over-dense plasma;microwave discharge ion source;high-density plasma;self-focused ion beam;hybrid fluid;pumping wave;polarization reversal;ECR based power absorption;plasma density gradient;MW power absorption;plasma breakdown time;guided-wave mode;magnetic field gradient;electrostatic ion cyclotron wave;ion-type waves;time-dependent Poisson solver;FEM-based fluid model","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interaction between the positive and negative IWs is studied by an intensified charge coupled device (ICCD), and the mechanism of the discharge propagation is analyzed. The experimental results show that the discharge can be divided into three stages: 1. generation of positive polar ionizing waves with velocity of 0.33 cm/ns; 2. generation of negative IW and its interaction with positive ones; 3. the decay of the discharge with the luminance attenuation. Furthermore, the luminance of the discharge channel and the speed of the IW s are enhanced because of the conducted channel behind the positive IW and the encounter of negative and positive IWs. Besides, With the change of the direction of the air flow, the initial time, the speed or the luminance intensity of IW s almost remain unchanged, which indicates the main drive of the IW s is the electric filed rather than air flow.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575858","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51777204,11611530681); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575858","","CCD image sensors;Electric breakdown;Conferences;Ionization;Glass;Fault location;Attenuation","brightness;discharges (electric);ionisation;wave propagation","ionization waves;long glass tube;nanosecond-pulse discharges;gas breakdown;nanosecond pulse sources;discharge propagation;positive polar ionizing waves;negative IW;discharge channel;positive IW","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In terrestrial plasmas, the dynamics of the ions and electrons are usually assumed to be slow with respect to the speed of light and as such, the treatment of these species is derived from the non-relativistic form of the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation, either through direct treatment or through a moment hierarchy. The electromagnetic closure is provided through one of a multitude of options, including electrostatics, magnetohydrodynamics, Darwin or full-wave Maxwell. However, of these, only electrostatics and magnetohydrodynamics can be shown to be consistent with the non-relativistic form of the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation at second order, while the Darwin model represents a higher order hybridization of these. In this work, we present the details of these models, discuss consistency with the non-relativistic form of the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation and present the dispersion relation for parallel and transverse electromagnetic waves in a microwave cavity under these assumptions. This shows that the Darwin approximation fully retains the physics of the continuity equation, allowing the formulation to capture full electromagnetic effects in cases with bounded electromagnetic waves, such as those found in klystrons and transit-time oscillators. These results offer insights into the differences between models that assume the static physics, traveling at zero group velocity, and instantaneous models where the wave is assumed to be traveling at infinite velocity.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575604","U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-NA0003525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575604","","Microwave integrated circuits;Magnetohydrodynamics;Electromagnetic scattering;Ions;Mathematical models;Microwave oscillators;Plasmas","Boltzmann equation;dispersion relations;electromagnetic fields;electromagnetic waves;electrostatics;klystrons;magnetohydrodynamics;Maxwell equations","plasma models;Maxwell's equations;electromagnetic approximations;electromagnetic fields;terrestrial plasmas;nonrelativistic form;Maxwell-Boltzmann equation;electromagnetic closure;electrostatics;magnetohydrodynamics;full-wave Maxwell;Darwin model;parallel waves;transverse electromagnetic waves;Darwin approximation;continuity equation;electromagnetic effects;bounded electromagnetic waves;instantaneous models","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The accelerator contains an embedded longitudinal magnetic probe array that measures the time evolution of the azimuthal magnetic field profile $B(z,t)$) with 5-cm spatial resolution, allowing reconstruction of the detailed structure of the current sheet propagating into neutral gas. The radial current density is $J_{R^{\sim}}$ -dB/dz and the spatial distribution of the electric potential V (z, t) is found from dV/dz = -L’ dI/dt. Thus, the local power available for plasma ionization and acceleration (JR V) and the local $jxB$ force profiles are known for the plasma in the experiment, while the plasma density and velocity profiles are unknown. We reconstruct the plasma density and velocity profiles by solving a 1-D MHD fluid model with a density source term to represent the ionization of the neutral gas. The experimental magnetic field $B(z,t)$ and potential $V(z,t)$ are used as inputs to generate the solution. The local ionization rate is found by assuming that resistive power dissipation $(RJ_{R}^{2})$ couples to ionization only; resistivity $R$ is obtained from generalized Ohm's law. The predicted plasma velocity and density are compared to direct measurements at the exit of the accelerator, where velocity is measured by ion Doppler spectroscopy and density by laser interferometry. The reconstruction approach is applied to characterize how the initial neutral density profile (controlled via timing of fast gas injection valves) affects the propagation of the ionizing current sheet and the performance of the accelerator. 1 D modeling of the plasma flow also allows for the local resistivity of the current sheet to be inferred, which is compared to existing resistivity models of partially-ionized plasma.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575704","ARPA-E; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575704","","Magnetic field measurement;Plasma accelerators;Density measurement;Ionization;Conductivity;Plasma measurements;Plasmas","current density;plasma accelerators;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma flow;plasma instability;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma probes;plasma simulation;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes","plasma ionization;coaxial plasma accelerator;current sheet dynamics;FuZE experiment;magnetic probe array;azimuthal magnetic field profile B;spatial resolution;neutral gas;radial current density;local power;local jxB force profiles;plasma density;1-D MHD fluid model;density source term;experimental magnetic field B;local ionization rate;plasma velocity;initial neutral density profile;ionizing current sheet;plasma flow;local resistivity;partially-ionized plasma;resistive power dissipation;Ohm law","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interaction of the magnetic field with the ferrite material inside isolators and circulators causes RF /microwave signals in the frequency band of interest transmitted to the adjacent port without too much loss but not in the opposite direction. This function is important to serve as a protection of microwave tubes from damage due to a reflection in some circumstances such as an impedance mismatch. This paper focuses on the design and development of a partial height ferrite circulator in an optimized geometry configuration to achieve a wider operating bandwidth of> 100 MHz with the frequency centered at 2.45 GHz. The validation of the design is performed using the finite element analysis. In comparison, a commercial circulator operates at the same frequency but with a standard 50 MHz bandwidth is employed. A circulator with bandwidth broadening from 50 to 100 MHz can serve as a low-cost but high-efficiency protection device for two magnetrons operating concurrently at same working power of 3 kW but different frequencies, one at 2430 and the other at 2480 MHz, employed in a microwave plasma processing reactor. A preliminary optimization using a small signal approximation of ferrite tensor shows that the overall operation ranging from 2340 to 2550 MHz with an insertion loss less than 0.24 dB, reflection, and isolation better than 20 dB can be achieved. A further validation of the design using large signal parameters of ferrite in the simulation and the manufacturing of a prototype are underway.

It is interesting to use perfluorinated liquids as propellants, because they have relatively low specific plasma formation energy. Also, it is an attractive idea to use the liquid both as an insulator and propellant. Under nanosecond pulsed conditions, the combination of porous insulating media and liquid dielectric may demonstrate unexpected behavior [2]. In this work, we present the results of measurements of the anode-initiated electrical breakdown front velocity in porous alumina ceramics saturated with perfluorinated esters, alkanes and other liquids. The experimental setup used comprises of a nanosecond pulse generator, breakdown cell and digital oscilloscope. The generator is a Tesla transformer, built into a coaxial forming line with a stored energy of 0.8 J, controlled by a gas-filled spark gap. The generator impedance is 50 $\Omega$, and voltage under no-load is 140 kV. The pulse duration is 8 ns under load-matched conditions, and the rise time is less than 0.5 ns. The configuration of electrodes is point-to-plane with positive point. Samples were made by uniaxial quasistatic compression of alumina nanopowder with specific surface area of 30 m2/g and annealed in air at a temperature of 1900 K [3]. The density of the samples was 66% of that of monolithic alumina. We used liquids that have relatively a high breakdown channel velocity in the single-pulse mode of voltage application $(\text{up}\ \text{to}\ 1.5\cdot 10^{5}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$. Ceramics saturated with propyl perfluoropentanoate demonstrates a significant decrease in breakdown channel speed (3–4 times) when the samples are thicker than those broken within a single pulse. This behavior may be attributed to the multi-pulse voltage application, and to the properties of the heterogeneous insulating media. Discharge cannot be initiated in a liquid within pores as easily as it can be in a free liquid, nor does it go as quickly as in monolithic alumina or sapphire. Pores with liquid between the grains of powder serve as barriers, which significantly reduce the mobility of charge carriers. Therefore, a combination of porous ceramics and liquid dielectric may be used as an effective insulator in the multipulse mode even in the case of easy-to-breakdown liquids.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575833","","Liquids;Electric breakdown;Propulsion;Media;Insulators;Generators;Ceramics","alumina;ceramics;dielectric liquids;electric breakdown;electrodes;nanoparticles;nanoporous materials;organic compounds;plasma devices;pulse generators;pulsed power technology;spark gaps","nanosecond breakdown;porous alumina ceramics;perfluorinated liquids;liquid dielectric;liquid propellant;plasma thrusters;propellants;insulator;nanosecond pulsed conditions;porous insulating media;anode-initiated electrical breakdown front velocity;perfluorinated esters;nanosecond pulse generator;breakdown cell;pulse duration;load-matched conditions;alumina nanopowder;specific surface area;monolithic alumina;relatively a high breakdown channel velocity;single-pulse mode;breakdown channel speed;multipulse voltage application;heterogeneous insulating media;free liquid;easy-to-breakdown liquids;plasma formation energy;digital oscilloscope.;gas-filled spark gap;uniaxial quasistatic compression;charge carrier mobility;Tesla transformer;energy 0.8 J;voltage 140.0 kV;time 8.0 ns;time 0.5 ns;temperature 1900.0 K;velocity 105.0 m/s;Al2O3","","","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A 526.5 nm, 10 J Thomson scattering diagnostic laser enables probing of the plasma conditions of these implosions with both spatial and temporal resolution. Plasma conditions imply that collective scattering spectral profiles will be observed, in which case electron and ion temperatures and plasma fluid element drift velocity can be obtained. The use of two laser pulses, both with a FWHM of 2.2 ns, that can be separated by 10ns allows observation of time-resolved spectra for a total consecutive time of ~6 ns in the present experiments. Spectra from the same scattering volume but collected by optics at differing angles with respect to the laser repeatedly imply ion temperatures that are inconsistent across viewing angles if the width of the ion features in the scattered spectral profile are interpreted as solely due to ion temperature. This indicates the presence of a source of non-thermal peak broadening that changes with scattering angle. Multiple methods of fitting the Thomson scattering spectral profile show that the presence of hydrodynamic drift velocity distributions in the plasma at stagnation can, together with ion temperature, give a better fit to the observed ion feature peak widths than ion temperature alone.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575378","NNSA(grant numbers:DE-NA0003764); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(grant numbers:B619181); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575378","","Temperature distribution;Neon;Scattering;Electron mobility;Ions;Optics;Plasmas","exploding wires;explosions;hydrodynamics;neon;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma temperature;plasma X-ray sources;Z pinch","nonthermal ION energy;gas-puff z-pinches;neon gas;z-pinch plasmas;pinch time;current rise time;plasma conditions;spatial resolution;temporal resolution;collective scattering spectral profiles;ion temperature;plasma fluid element drift velocity;laser pulses;time-resolved spectra;total consecutive time;scattering volume;ion features;scattered spectral profile;nonthermal peak;scattering angle;Thomson scattering spectral profile;neon gas puff z-pinch plasmas;COBRA pulsed power generator;ion temperatures;electron temperature;time 240.0 ns;current 0.9 MA;wavelength 526.5 nm;energy 10.0 J;time 2.2 ns;time 10.0 ns;time 6.0 ns","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This question is especially intriguing when we consider that the vast majority of analytic formulations of vacuum electronics devices rely on cold fluid theory. In this initial work, we use both particle-in-cell (WARP and VSIM) and fluid simulation (USIM) to look at well understood problems, such as a Pierce diode and the driver cavity of a simple klystron to study this question in both electrostatic and electromagnetic contexts, as well as transient and steady-state (“gun-code” PIC) simulations.

As a result, this area of research has been thrust to the forefront of scientific discovery. The ability to create, control, and diagnose such extreme states of matter is not only vital to the Stockpile Stewardship Program but is also advancing our fundamental understanding of the visible universe.

Pulsed-power drivers use magnetic fields to compress matter into WDM regimes. The magnetic field also provides the confinement time necessary to relax into this state at the mesoscale.

The study about electron density and temperature of low-pressure femtosecond laser plasma has already been.][1] In this experiment, titanium sapphire laser having, a maximum laser energy of 100mJ, a pulse half width of 100 fs, and a wavelength of 780 nm, is used. Incidentally, the laser energy in the chamber decreases to 50 % of laser energy, because the chamber windows diameter is smaller than laser light diameter. The electron density and electron temperature of laser induced high-pressure Ar plasma are respectively measured. Electron density up to 100 atm is measured by Mach-Zender interferometer. The Ar-ion laser is used as a probe laser source. It is difficult to find out a turning point of interferometric signal at which the electron density reaches a maximum. Therefore, the peak electron density is estimated by extrapolating the observed electron density up to the time at which laser pulse is terminated. Dense plasma with an electron density of the order of 1025 - 1026 m-3 at focal spot is obtained. The theoretical calculation of electron density is done and compares to experimental results. The calculated results are lower than the experimental results, because this theoretical calculation does not include effect of multiphoton ionization. The electron temperature up to 50 atm is measured by using emission spectroscopy of the laser induced Plasma. The measured electron temperatures are respectively obtained by the Boltzmann plot method and the continuous spectrum of the light intensity distribution. The measured electron temperatures are about 10000 K. On the other hands, the calculated electron temperature is obtained from the energy balance equation taking into consideration the energy gain due to inverse bremsstrahlung and the energy lose due to elastic collision and collision ionization. Theoretical calculations and experimental results are qualitatively agreed above 10 atm. However, they are disagreed at gas pressure below 10 atm, because multiphoton ionization is not considered in theoretical calculation.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575514","","Temperature measurement;Laser theory;Optical interferometry;Density measurement;Ionization;Measurement by laser beam;Plasma measurements","argon;bremsstrahlung;electron density;high-speed optical techniques;ionisation;laser beam effects;Mach-Zehnder interferometers;multiphoton processes;photoionisation;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma pressure;plasma production by laser;plasma temperature;titanium","high-pressure argon plasma;high-intensity laser light;laser irradiation;low-pressure femtosecond laser plasma;titanium sapphire laser;maximum laser energy;laser light diameter;argon-ion laser;probe laser source;electron density;laser pulse;electron temperature;interferometric signal;elastic collision;collision ionization;light intensity distribution;energy balance equation;inverse bremsstrahlung;Boltzmann plot method;emission spectroscopy;multiphoton ionization;energy 100.0 mJ;time 100.0 fs;wavelength 780.0 nm;pressure 100.0 atm;size 1026.0 m;pressure 50.0 atm;pressure 10.0 atm;Ar","","","","1","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The radiating shocks were observed and the formation of dynamic hohlraums is affirmed in this 7~8MA pulse power facility. In this paper the implosion dynamics of dynamic hohlraums is numerically investigated using a one-dimensional RMHD code using the same parameters in experiments. It is shown that a local high pressure region, which is generated by the impaction of the tungsten plasma with the converter plasma, is crucial to launch the strongly radiating shock wave and to form the dynamic hohlruam. As the shock propagates to the axis, the hohlraum volume becomes small and the radiation temperature is also increased. Basically, the hohlraum radiation is determined by the detailed profiles of plasma conditions when the wire-array plasma impacts onto the CH converter plasma. Numerical results show that a suitable mass ratio of the wire-array to the CH converter is very important to affect the hohlraum radiation. When this mass ratio is slightly lower than unity, for example 0.75, a relatively optimal dynamic hohlraum can be produced. Also, the ratio of the initial wire-array radius to the converter radius is important to determine the shape of the hohlraum radiation. The radiation transfer largely depends on the radiation temperature and the mass density of the converter. When the mass ratio of the wire-array to the converter is near 1.0, the radiation temperature can be increased to about 120e V with the PTS drive current. In this case, the radiation generated from the interaction region will quickly transfer to the center of the converter. The experimental end-on x-ray images present the overall process of radiation production and transfer of this kind of dynamic hohlraums. As the mass ratio is decreased, the radiation temperature will also be deceased, and the converter will become more opaque to the radiation. In the case of extremely low mass ratio such as lower than 0.3, the peak radiation temperature will be lower than 100e V, and the radiation transfers very slowly to the interior of the converter and presents the large non-uniformity, which is also observed in experiments on the PTS facility.

This is consistent with earlier codes used for the original designs of HERMES, Saturn, and Z2. However, looking at spatial profiles (charge density, current density, velocity, electric and magnetic fields) a finer mesh was required for good comparison to theory. These details matter to the quality of the electron beam for many applications and surface plasma formation. This work focuses on showing the order of convergence for the spatial profiles for MITL flow as a function of the element count, time step, and number of macroparticles used.

The reconstruction is performed from line-integrated quantities measured by a set of cameras equipped with neutron detectors. Due to technical constraints, the total number of neutron cameras as well as the number of lines of sight in most of the existing tokamaks is very limited. Thus, the problem of such a tomographic reconstruction is very challenging due to sparse coverage of the plasma region.

Integrated optical emission spectroscopy revealed that total OH yield along the discharge gap increased with pulse width up to 800 ns and decreased with pulse width increasing from 800 ns to 4 μs. Terephthalic acid (TA) was used to trap OH radicals forming 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) from which the fluorescence can be measured for determining OHaq concentration in liquid. It is found that the highest OH yield in liquid phase was at a pulse width of 200 ns. These results suggest that higher production efficiency for OH radicals in both gas- and liquid- phase can be obtained with pulse widths in the nanosecond-range under studied experimental conditions.

This lack of understanding stems largely in part from the difficulty of making direct experimental measurements of this process. Indeed, the types of direct physical probing that traditionally would yield this measurement have been shown to be highly perturbative in these devices [1]. In this work, we demonstrate that the cross-field transport can be inferred non-invasively by measuring the ion dynamics in the Hall direction of the discharge. This technique hinges on the assumption that the mechanism that drives the electron transport is the result of a momentum-conserving interaction with the ions. The process thus works to drive electrons across field lines while also imparting momentum to the ions in the Hall direction. By measuring this component of the ion momentum non-invasively with Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and employing a quasilinear approximation to relate the ion and electron dynamics, it is possible to infer the effective electron mobility in the discharge.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575463","NASA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575463","","Magnetic field measurement;Plasma accelerators;Electron accelerators;Measurement by laser beam;Electron mobility;Ions;Plasma measurements","electron mobility;fluorescence;Hall effect;ion engines;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes","electron dynamics;effective electron mobility;noninvasive measurements;Hall effect accelerator;anomalously high mobility;magnetic field lines;crossed-field;dominant but least understood processes;low-temperature plasmas;direct experimental measurements;direct physical probing;cross-field transport;ion dynamics;Hall direction;electron transport;momentum-conserving interaction;ion momentum noninvasively","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We experimentally demonstrate that the optimum grazing incidence angle increases linearly with atomic number from 17 degrees for Z=42 (Mo) to 43 degrees for Z=66 (Dy), corresponding to densities of 1.5 to 8 x 1020 cm-3, but as mentioned above for the high Z elements refraction shifts the maxim gain region to lower values.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9576025","NSF(grant numbers:1509925); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576025","","Science - general;X-ray lasers;US Government;Laser excitation;Plasmas;Transient analysis;Plasma density","dysprosium;electron density;laser beam effects;molybdenum;optical pumping;plasma density;plasma production by laser;plasma simulation;X-ray lasers","electron density;rapid heating;refraction shifts;atomic number;gain-saturated plasma-based X-ray lasers;grazing incidence angle;subpicosecond pump pulse;plasma density;isoelectronic scaling;transient traveling wave excitation;wavelength 6.85 nm;wavelength 6.67 nm;wavelength 6.11 nm;wavelength 6.41 nm;wavelength 5.85 nm","","","","2","USGov","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Velikovich et al., [1] studied the Nernst effect in the induction equation for such a problem under the assumption that the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure $(\beta)$ was large. Other electro-thermal processes, such as Ettingshausen, Joule heating, and Nernst-thermal heating vary inversely with $\beta$. To study all these we have extended the self-similar formulation to allow for an arbitrary $\beta$. The self-similar ansatz requires constant total pressure, thermal plus magnetic. Four self-similar solutions are presented with the same density and temperature boundary conditions: two of high $\beta$ and two of low $\beta,$ and for each of these with and without electro-thermal terms. At high $\beta$ only the N ernst term $i$n the induction equation affects the solution. At low $\beta$ The Ettingshausen term is larger than thermal conduction at the wall, and the thermal N ernst term is negative. The results are proposed as verification tests for advanced, multi-physics, MHD codes. An example calculation is presented from a 1D MHD simulation code that allows for total pressure changes through the momentum equation. Comparison with the self-similar solution for one case shows that the simulation results approach the self-similar solution.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575273","DOE/NNSA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575273","","Heating systems;Magnetohydrodynamics;Codes;Simulation;Conferences;Thermal conductivity;Mathematical models","plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation;thermal conductivity;thermomagnetic effects;Z pinch","magnetic pressure;electro-thermal processes;Nernst-thermal heating;self-similar ansatz;self-similar solution;induction equation;Ettingshausen term;thermal conduction;thermal N ernst term;1D MHD simulation code;cold planar wall;hot plasma;embedded magnetic field;electro-thermal terms;magnetohydrodynamic solutions;plasma density;plasma temperature","","","","1","USGov","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, standoff, rapid detection is the most desired capability for an analytical tool for identifying dangerous substances in the field such as high-energy explosives and radioactive nuclear materials. Currently extensive efforts are going on to use emission spectroscopy of laser-produced plasma (LPP) or Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for standoff detection. However, the sensitivity of LIBS is poorer compared to sampling based detection techniques (eg. mass-spectroscopy). In addition to this, the spectral resolution available for all emission based methods are limited to instrumental broadening of the detection system. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of LPPs can address these limitations.1 In LIF, a second laser is used to excite the lower-level or ground state population which exists during the entire lifespan of LPP even when the plasma is cooler in comparison with LIBS where hotter conditions are prerequisite for thermal excitation. By monitoring the plasma conditions at later times of its evolution there is a significant reduction in line broadening mechanisms in the plasma. The instrumental broadening with the LIF method is dictated by the linewidth of the probe laser, which for CW laser sources is very small (~ a few femtometers).","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575329","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy; Battelle Memorial Institute(grant numbers:DE-AC05-76RLO 1830); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575329","","Spectroscopy;Laser theory;Stationary state;Fluorescence;Tools;Solids;Solid lasers","fluorescence;ground states;measurement by laser beam;plasma diagnostics;plasma production by laser;spectral line broadening;spectrochemical analysis","line broadening mechanisms;optical transitions;2D fluorescence spectroscopy;standoff isotopic analysis;atomic transitions;resonant scattering;direct fluorescent emission;ablation laser;cw LIF laser;focused ns laser pulses;ground state population;lower-level population;probe laser;plasma conditions;instrumental broadening;mass-spectroscopy;laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy;emission spectroscopy;radioactive nuclear materials;high-energy explosives;dangerous substances;standoff distances;laser-produced plasmas;laser induced fluorescence;solid materials;standoff detection;CW laser sources","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The average axial jet velocity across all four materials was measured to be 2.9 $\pm 0.5\times 10$ cm/s. The average jet diameter and the average radial jet expansion rate displayed inverse relationships with $\mathrm{Z}$, which may be attributed to radiative cooling effects.

The mean divergence angle of the jet was found to vary with wire material and correlated inversely with the thermal conductivity of the cold wire.

So as to maximize the adsorption capacity, ethylene adsorption characteristics of various zeolites (ZSM-5, USY, Y, beta, etc.) were first examined, and then Ag, Pd and Ag-Pd were supported on the zeolite exhibiting the largest adsorption capacity by ion exchange method to find out the best metal component. The prepared adsorbent pellets of about 10g were packed in a ceramic tube in which a high voltage electrode was coaxially installed. A copper foil was wound around the outer surface of the ceramic tube, which served as a ground electrode. The feed gas consisted of 79% nitrogen, 21 % oxygen and 200 ppm ethylene. The flow rates of the gases were controlled by mass flow controllers, and the total flow rate was fixed at 2 L min-1. The breakthrough curves obtained with the above mentioned adsorbents showed that Pd supported on ZSM-5 was the best, and further experiments were carried out using only Pd/ZSM-5. The treatment of ethylene with Pd/ZSM-5 and plasma was a repetitive cycle of adsorption and regeneration. First, the gas mixture containing 200 ppm of ethylene was continuously fed into the reactor for 30 min to adsorb ethylene, and plasma was created inside the zeolite-packed bed for 2 min to regenerate the ethylene-enriched adsorbent by plasma-catalytic oxidation. The measurements of the concentration of CO2 produced as a result of plasma-catalytic oxidation indicated that the adsorbed ethylene was completely oxidized within 5 min, depending on the intensity of plasma discharge. Identical results were obtained by repeating the adsorption and oxidation process several times, demonstrating that the cyclic adsorption-oxidation process using the Pd/ZSM-5 adsorbent and plasma can be applied to agricultural storage facilities for ethylene removal.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575670","","Partial discharges;Electrodes;Adsorption;Project management;Wounds;Oxidation;Plasmas","adsorption;agricultural products;carbon compounds;catalysis;catalysts;ceramics;chemical reactors;copper;electrochemical electrodes;flow control;gas mixtures;ion exchange;materials preparation;nitrogen;organic compounds;oxidation;oxygen;palladium;pipes;plasma chemistry;product quality;silver;storage;zeolites","agricultural storage facilities;ethylene adsorption characteristics;adsorbent pellets;ceramic tube;mass flow controllers;total flow rate;zeolite-packed bed;plasma-catalytic oxidation;plasma discharge;cyclic adsorption-oxidation process;ion exchange method;high voltage electrode;copper foil;feed gas;nitrogen;oxygen;ZSM-5;gas mixture;CO2 concentration measurement;zeolite-based adsorbent;plasma based adsorbent;mass 10.0 g;time 30.0 min;time 2.0 min;time 5.0 min;Ag-Pd;CO2;O2;N2","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Kim and Lee reported that thermal diffusion due to a heated susceptor affects the distribution of neutrals and radicals [1]. Unintentionally, the high temperature on the susceptor causes depletion of background gas, which can affect ion energy and angle distribution (IEAD) due to the reduced collisions of ions with neutrals. In an atomic layer etching (ALE) process, it is important to control ion energy and angle distributions. The ion energy must be in ALE window for self-limiting reaction, and the ion incident angle should be perpendicular to the substrate for anisotropic etching [2], [3]. In this study, we investigate the effects of susceptor temperature on plasma parameters, especially IEAD, in a capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) using particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision method. With the increase of susceptor temperature, background gas density near the wafer is depleted, the plasma density decreases, and the sheath size increases, respectively.

Properties of the sheath region are crucial to overall plasma properties as well as particles and energy reaching to the wall. Due to the sharp gradients fluid theory has singularity and kinetic approach is essential for its proper understanding. We have developed a 1d3v (one dimension in space and three dimension in velocity) Kinetic Trajectory Simulation (KTS) model [1] to study various properties of magnetized plasma sheaths in presence of an oblique magnetic field. The problem is of interest in divertor type Tokamaks, where the field lines outside the last -closed-flux-surfaces strike wall at different angles. In KTS model, we consider the distribution functions of involved species to be given at the presheath-sheath boundary and their characteristics is obtained by solving respective kinetic equations for given initial and boundary conditions. The method is iterated unless it converges self-consistently yielding the final distribution functions throughout the sheath region. It has been observed that the particle fluxes and their energies reaching the wall as well most of the sheath parameters can be regulated by varying the applied magnetic fields and its obliqueness. The results agree qualitatively with earlier similar works [2] and, as our approach is kinetic, we expect better and more precise quantitative understanding [3]–[5] of the magnetized plasma sheath.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575673","","Fluids;Mathematical models;Kinetic theory;Trajectory;Tokamaks;Plasma sheaths;Magnetic fields","fusion reactor divertors;plasma boundary layers;plasma density;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes;plasma-wall interactions;Tokamak devices","sheath region;plasma properties;sharp gradients fluid theory;kinetic approach;magnetized plasma sheath;oblique magnetic field;presheath-sheath boundary;respective kinetic equations;sheath parameters;applied magnetic fields;Self-Consistant 1D3V Kinetic Trajectory Simulation Model;material wall","","","","5","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PIC simulations1 have shown that phase-locking is possible using modulated electron in jection to control the spoke formation. An experimental setup using Gated Field Emission Arrays (GFEAs) for the modulated electron injection offers a potential solution to this problem by permitting the injection of electrons into the interaction space. The present work explores the feasibility of a GFEA-driven industrial magnetron operating at 907 MHz and low power (~1kW). This magnetron will operate at -9kV, 150 mA, and 900G. The design accomplishes the electron injection by arranging 30 GFEA die around a 10-sided (faceted) cathode stripline structure with four delay-line modulated phases. Facet plates provide protection for the GFEA die from ion back-bombardment. The GFEAs under test are high-density die each containing several million emitters based on a design shown to provide emission current exceeding 100 A/cm2 in prior experiments2, Recent efforts demonstrate proof of concept for the GFEA-driven magnetron system by testing these GFEA die in conditions parallel to those required for oscillation of the same magnetron. A phosphor screen at a potential of 300 V was used in a test chamber to study emission current density and uniformity of the GFEA. Both emission current and leakage current were measured, and it was experimentally determined that the requisite 6 mA per die required for oscillation should be achievable under pulsed (10 kHz) conditions with high frequency (905 MHz) GFEA experiments planned. Experimental and transmission line modeling results will be presented.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575300","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-16-1-0083); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575300","","Magnetrons;Power transmission lines;Pulse measurements;Stripline;Phosphors;Logic gates;Transmission line measurements","cathodes;current density;electron field emission;leakage currents;magnetrons;strip lines","modulated electron injection;GFEA-driven industrial magnetron;30 GFEA die;delay-line modulated phases;high-density die;GFEA-driven magnetron system;emission current density;high frequency GFEA experiments;phase controlled magnetron;gated field emission arrays;external systems;phase-locking;PIC simulations;faceted cathode stripline structure;ion back-bombardment;phosphor screen;leakage current;transmission line modeling;voltage 300.0 V;frequency 10.0 kHz;frequency 905.0 MHz;frequency 907.0 MHz;current 150.0 mA;voltage -9.0 kV","","","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Potential advantages of collecting solar energy in space include a higher collection rate and a longer collection period without a loss to a diffusing atmosphere, and the possibility of placing a solar collector in an orbiting location where light is available at all times. The cost of the wireless power transmission (WPT) is about 30% of the total cost of the space-based solar power system (SSPS). The main portion of the high cost is on the development and transportation due to the large number and mass of the magnetrons used in the WPT subsystem. In this work, we propose to design and develop a rising-sun magnetron capable of producing higher power at one or two orders of magnitude than those commercially available on the market today so that the development and installation (transportation) cost of an SSPS can be dramatically reduced. The design and development are performed using a conformal finite-difference time-domain particle-in-cell simulations as implemented in the VSim code. The first goal of this research is to design and develop magnetrons operating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and at a power level of> 100 kW for wireless power transmission. A preliminary design after the optimization could achieve the required power at a high efficiency of > 80%.

It was found that Pierce's classical 3-wave TWT dispersion relation needs to be modified, in particular the circuit mode is modified by a new term, which they call q. This q for the modification of circuit mode at high beam currents is entirely analogous to Pierce's space charge parameter, Q, for the modification of the beam mode. For forward wave amplification, q may lead to a detune in the circuit mode phase velocity by as much as two percent in a realistic example1. Since Johnson's theory of backward wave oscillation (BWO) in a TWT3 was based solely on Pierce's 3-wave dispersion relation, we analyze the effect of q on Johnson's threshold condition for BWO. The value of q, together with of the values of the Pierce parameters C and Q, will be determined for the backward wave mode using the exact hot-tube dispersion relation1.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575831","DARPA(grant numbers:P010183085,HR0011-16-C-0080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575831","","Traveling wave tubes;Conferences;Space charge;Plasmas;Dispersion;Oscillators;Contracts","backward wave oscillators;dispersion relations;space charge;travelling wave tubes","Johnson theory;backward wave oscillation;traveling wave tube;exact cold tube dispersion relation;tape helix model;3-wave TWT dispersion relation;high beam currents;beam mode;forward wave amplification;circuit mode phase velocity;backward wave mode;hot-tube dispersion relation;Johnson threshold condition;Pierce 3-wave dispersion relation;tape helix TWT;hot tube dispersion relation;Pierce space charge parameter;Pierce classical 3-wave TWT dispersion","","","","3","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nucl. Fusion, 57,022022 (201 7)). To explore parametric decay instabilities during LHCD experiments on EAST, a particle-in-cell simulation code GCPIC has been developed to study interactions of plasmas and lower hybrid waves (LHWs). It is found that if the plasma density is sufficiently high, the launched LHEs experiences the mode conversion of slow and fast modes in typical H-mode discharges. The wave amplitude is then enhanced during the back-and forth propagations between the mode conversion layer and the cutoff layer. As a result, the parametric decays are observed near the mode-conversion layer, The pump wave decays into a LHW at a lower frequency which can penetrate the mode-conversion layer and low frequency electromagnetic waves which can resonantly interact with electrons, resulting the electron heating. The incident wave energy is thus dissipated in the plasma edge, which greatly reduces the current drive efficiency.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9576014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576014","","Electromagnetic heating;Heat pumps;Conferences;Electromagnetic scattering;Resonant frequency;Drives;Tokamak devices","plasma density;plasma hybrid waves;plasma instability;plasma radiofrequency heating;plasma simulation;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes;Tokamak devices","EAST tokamak;lower hybrid wave current drive;current drive efficiency;plasma density;parametric decay instabilities;plasma edge;LHCD experiments;particle-in-cell simulation code GCPIC;typical H-mode discharges;wave amplitude;mode conversion layer;parametric decays;mode-conversion layer;pump wave decays;low frequency electromagnetic waves;incident wave energy;particle-in-cell simulations","","","","0","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, the beam cross section is chosen as half of the minimum width of the tube cross section i.e. the beam size scales down linearly as the frequency goes higher. In addition, velocity spread is very prominent in small cross section beams and, as such, beams are mostly dominated by emittance. One of the biggest challenges for high frequency tubes is to determine the maximum allowable beam size without significant current interception. This will enable the tube to operate with the greatest possible beam power and thus have both the largest gain and output power possible. Therefore, we propose to determine the intercepted beam current in an emittance dominated beam for high frequency tubes. Our objective is to provide the tools needed to determine beam pipe sizes for arbitrary levels of beam emittance and beam current interception rates.","2576-7208","978-1-5386-4589-5","10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575660","","Particle beams;Conferences;Tools;Electron tubes;Plasmas;High frequency;Current density","beam handling techniques;particle beam diagnostics","beam cross section;beam size scales;high frequency tubes;maximum allowable beam size;beam power;output power;intercepted beam current;beam pipe;beam emittance;beam current interception rates;beam current density;emittance dominated beams;high frequency TWTS;power handling capabilities","","","","2","USGov","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spectroscopic and chromatographic methods used for the metabolomic analysis of botanical material and its derived commercial pharmaceuticals generate huge datasets that need to be modeled using adequate PR methods. In most cases, PR analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) are routinely employed to extract maximum information from these analytical datasets. More accurate and reliable prediction of phytoequivalency and different quality issues are now achievable by these computationally-modelled metabolomics data. We present herein a novel approach for assessing phytoequivalency of botanicals using artichoke leaves as a case study where different pattern recognition tools were explored for modelling proton nuclear magnetic spectral data of artichoke preparations. Using this approach, the variable efficacy encountered with some phytomedicines can be tackled in a more robust and automated manner.","","978-1-5386-9239-4","10.1109/ICCTA45985.2018.9499199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499199","Pattern recognition;Chemometrics;Metabolomics;Phytoequivalency;Artichoke","Metabolomics;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Quality control;Standardization;Tools;Data models","biochemistry;biomedical NMR;chromatography;data analysis;least squares approximations;pattern recognition;pharmaceuticals;principal component analysis","phytomedicines;NMR metabolomics data;botanicals standardisation;metabolite profiling;chromatographic methods;botanical material;commercial pharmaceuticals;PR analyses;partial least squares-discriminant analysis;quality issues;computationally-modelled metabolomics data;pattern recognition tools;proton nuclear magnetic spectral data;artichoke preparations;variable efficacy","","","","14","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a study is important to investigate the impact of using Inbound Open Innovation product platforming on new software product introduction by SMEs located in Egypt where minimal researches were conducted. The population was Egyptian SMEs that works in the software industry. The findings from this study are from Binary Logistic Regression results and provide evidence that there is an insignificant relation between the use of Inbound Open Innovation Product Platforming and New Software Product Introduction by Egyptian SMEs. The main conclusion drawn from this study is companies if not educated enough and fully aware about the technicality and functionality of the Open Innovation “externally developed” platform used and have a good understanding of how they will build their product upon it, they can't obtain the full benefits from using it. This study recommends for any future study to separate each platform technology, with two group of companies the one who use it and the others who are not, this would provide a more accurate measurement of company awareness of the platform technology used and would also lead to having significant results in return. The study also recommends for SMEs' decision makers to have good awareness about the software product requirements specification and Open Innovation platform features, for efficiently building their new product.","","978-1-5386-9239-4","10.1109/ICCTA45985.2018.9499205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499205","Open Innovation;Product Platforming;the Introduction of New Software Product","Industries;Technological innovation;Sociology;Buildings;Companies;Software;Statistics","decision making;DP industry;innovation management;logistics;regression analysis;small-to-medium enterprises","platform technology;software product requirements specification;Egyptian SMEs;software industry;inbound open innovation product platforming;innovation platform features;software product introduction;open innovation externally developed platform;binary logistic regression","","","","23","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model depends on the operating frequency, temperature and bias conditions. A neural system design is displayed to encourage the expectation exactness of the presented show. The Model accuracy has been demonstrated by coordinating anticipated and estimated values of heterojunction transistors for a specific data set of noise parameters at various frequencies, temperatures and bias points. Here the design will be to investigative noise model of an AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs Hetrojunction transistor. It is shown that introducing DNA computing enhances the obtained values for noise figure, and also gives higher accuracy for prediction of the four parameters required by using one neural network for this purpose. It is also shown that only one neural network for simulation of noise figure parameters was used, without using a special network for Rn/50 values, so it's clear that DNA not only enhances the values but ails saved time and neural networks.","","978-1-5386-9239-4","10.1109/ICCTA45985.2018.9499145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499145","noise figure;HEMT;noise parameters;heterojunction;microwave;neural network;DNA computing","Training;Noise figure;Temperature distribution;Computational modeling;Neurons;DNA;Heterojunctions","aluminium compounds;biocomputing;electronic engineering computing;gallium arsenide;high electron mobility transistors;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;microwave field effect transistors;microwave transistors;neural nets;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device noise","DNA computing modeling;HEMT transistor noise parameters;heterojunction transistors;presented neural network model;cascade feed-forward training algorithm;heterojunction microwave transistor noise parameters;bias conditions;neural system design;model accuracy;investigative noise model;noise figure parameters;noise model;operating frequency;temperature conditions;AlGaAs-InGaAs-GaAs","","","","15","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method is based on finding all the training examples that share the same leaves in the bagging trees ensemble with the test vector. Then we calculate the predicted target value based on the training examples respective weights (how many times each training example share the same terminal node in each tree with the test example). Two types of bagging trees are investigated; (classification and regression). We test our proposed method on the monthly time series data from M3 competition dataset with horizons range (1 to 18). We compare our results with other machine learning and statistical forecasting techniques.

Analyzing potential terrorism data is without doubt an indispensable task not only to understand these terrorist events, mainly terrorist implicated actors, their communities and their operation methods and tactics, but also to predict future attacks. However, terrorist events are commonly conducted differently and rarely fit the models of conventional attacks. Thus, terrorist events are usually hard to analyze, mine and investigate. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional model, named Terrorist Data Warehouse (TerDW), for allowing terrorist investigators to perform interesting and specific analysis for decision-making objectives. Practically, while consulting gathered information relative to specific terrorist attacks, such as attacks' locations, dates, used weapons, and implicated attackers, investigators can query the proposed data warehouse (TerDW) using multidimensional queries. The proposed model is based on consistent dimensions and measures. Terrorist attacks data are extracted from Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a well-known database that includes information about terrorist events that took place from 1970 to 2017. Examples of queries have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. The queries' results demonstrate clearly that the proposed model allows investigators to carry out more appropriate multidimensional analysis, investigations and decisions.","","978-1-5386-9239-4","10.1109/ICCTA45985.2018.9499167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499167","Terrorist Attack;GTD;TerDW;MDX;OLAP analysis","Analytical models;Databases;Terrorism;Weapons;Decision making;Data warehouses;Predictive models","data mining;data warehouses;decision making;terrorism","multidimensional model;named Terrorist Data Warehouse;terrorist investigators;specific terrorist attacks;implicated attackers;Terrorist attacks data;terrorist events;Terrorist attacks analysis;daily dire human;material damages;analyzing potential terrorism data;terrorist implicated actors;future attacks;conventional attacks","","","","11","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this new assessment method is proved to be equivalent with an analogous method using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers as tools developed in an earlier work, it reduces the required computational burden, since it requires the calculation of two components only (instead of three in the case of the Triangular Fuzzy Numbers) for obtaining the mean value of the Grey Numbers involved.

This paper is proposing a solution and a proof of concept for secured translation through a combination between Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Network and Homomorphic encryption, where neural network is trained on the plaintext. During the production, we feed the encoder with the encrypted text as well as the public key used for encryption and the decoder will generate the translated text in an encryption format which will be decrypted using the private key hosted at client side. The proposed work is verified using a large dataset of English and Arabic words. The results show that the output of the translation is not affected at all under the secure mode (after encryption of the input words) in comparison to the normal mode (without encryption.)

To enhance the performance of IDSs, machine learning classifiers are used to aid detection accuracy and greatly reduce the false positive and false negative rate. In this research we have evaluated six classifiers such as Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Nave Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on three different types of datasets such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and Phishing dataset.

These kinds of attacks require an innovative method of authentication to protect unwanted parties from presence in an authorized network and its consequences from violating user's privacy and other effects. This paper proposes a novel approach for using the ATmega328p microcontroller to generate an unclonable key based on the chip signature and manufacturing stored data as well as the static random access memory to act as a physically unclonable function (SRAM-PUF) of the Atmega328P chip. The generated key has been subjected to different statistical tests. A proof of concept model has been successfully built to test a suggested authentication scheme between two devices.

Most of these studies are based on spot speed data collection, which is done by measuring the speed at specific locations such as in the middle of the tangent and the center of the horizontal curve. However, the maximum and minimum speeds don't correspond to the center of tangents and curves, respectively. In this study, a computer simulator was used to produce a continues speed profile to facilitate analyzing the driver speed behavior for various pathway scenarios. In the current stage of development, the focus was to evaluate the effect of the transition (spiral) curve existence in the highway alignment on the driver speed magnitude. Measurement is taken at five specific locations for each segment of the tested two-lane highway. These points are located before, during and after the curve. A comparison was made to illustrate the role of spiral curve existence on the magnitude of driver's speed. Using this comparison, the usefulness of the alignment with transition curve can be evaluated in contrast to the alignment without transition curve. The following variables were considered in this analysis: 1) curve radius, 2) deflection angle and 3) direction of driving. Briefly., the usefulness of the spiral curve was significant in the small curves and big deflection angles.","","978-1-5386-9239-4","10.1109/ICCTA45985.2018.9499106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499106","drivers' simulator;spiral curve;two-lane rural highway;deflection angle;direction of drive;speed","Road transportation;Spirals;Data collection;Vehicles","road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","transition curve existence;highway alignment;driver speed;two-lane highway;spiral curve existence;computer simulator;two-lane rural highway;highway design consistency;spot speed data collection;horizontal curve;minimum speeds;speed profile","","","","7","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The strength of DNA computing will fortify the existing security systems by checking up a new probability of the hybrid cryptographic system.

However, ensemble machine learning techniques are introduced to perform better than traditional statistical and AI techniques as it combines several base models to produce one optimal predictive model with better performance and accuracy. A comparative study is applied on different machine learning techniques on customer's loans dataset obtained from a public bank's database that contains customer's loans and personal data.

Cloud storage holds the advantages of high reliability, simple management and cost-effective. However, as each technological advance, the cloud computing also brings its own risks, data security issues are one of the top concerns when dealing with sensitive data. To ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data, the owner must encrypt it before outsourcing. When data are encrypted, a tradeo □ must be achieved between security and performance. Existing solutions are not suitable for cloud data warehouse because those solutions induce a heavy overhead in terms of data storage and query performance. So because the nature of data warehouse, a suitable solution must be proposed that balances the security and the performance of data warehouse hosted in the cloud. In this paper, we propose (CloudWar) an efficient schema based on a homomorphic encryption algorithm for securing and querying a data warehouse hosted in the cloud. CloudWar addresses the short coming of existing approaches by reducing the volume overhead and time complexity of query processing will still maintaining good privacy and performance. Also, this new schema proposes a new signature for verifying the integrity of data when received from the cloud. Theoretical and experimental results show the efficiency of CloudWar in terms of privacy and performance with respect to other solutions.","","978-1-5386-9239-4","10.1109/ICCTA45985.2018.9499193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499193","Privacy;Cloud computing;Data warehouse;Security","Cloud computing;Privacy;Data privacy;Query processing;Memory;Data warehouses;Outsourcing","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;data warehouses;outsourcing;query processing;storage management","querying data warehouse;cloud computing;cloud storage;data security issues;sensitive data;cloud data warehouse;data storage;query performance;CloudWar;data warehouse security;query processing;homomorphic encryption algorithm;volume overhead reduction","","","","31","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this new assessment method is proved to be equivalent with an analogous method using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers as tools developed in an earlier work, it reduces the required computational burden, since it requires the calculation of two components only (instead of three in the case of the Triangular Fuzzy Numbers) for obtaining the mean value of the Grey Numbers involved.

But compare the outcomes, and the particles seem as if they are instantaneously influencing each other at a distance—even if they are light-years apart. This, in a nutshell, is entanglement, and if it seems weird, then this book is for you. Totally Random is a graphic experiential narrative that unpacks the deep and insidious significance of the curious correlation between entangled particles to deliver a gut-feel glimpse of a world that is not what it seems. See for yourself how entanglement has led some of the greatest thinkers of our time to talk about crazy-sounding stuff like faster-than-light signaling, many worlds, and cats that are both dead and alive. Find out why it remains one of science's most paradigm-shaking discoveries. Join Niels Bohr's therapy session with the likes of Einstein, Schrödinger, and other luminaries and let go of your commonsense notion of how the world works. Use your new understanding of entanglement to do the seemingly impossible, like beat the odds in the quantum casino, or quantum encrypt a message to evade the Sphinx's all-seeing eye.

Einstein's lengthy itinerary consisted of stops in Hong Kong and Singapore, two brief stays in China, a six-week whirlwind lecture tour of Japan, a twelve-day tour of Palestine, and a three-week visit to Spain. This handsome edition makes available, for the first time, the complete journal that Einstein kept on this momentous journey. The telegraphic-style diary entries--quirky, succinct, and at times irreverent—record Einstein's musings on science, philosophy, art, and politics, as well as his immediate impressions and broader thoughts on such events as his inaugural lecture at the future site of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a garden party hosted by the Japanese Empress, an audience with the King of Spain, and meetings with other prominent colleagues and statesmen. Entries also contain passages that reveal Einstein's stereotyping of members of various nations and raise questions about his attitudes on race. This beautiful edition features stunning facsimiles of the diary's pages, accompanied by an English translation, an extensive historical introduction, numerous illustrations, and annotations. Supplementary materials include letters, postcards, speeches, and articles, a map of the voyage, a chronology, a bibliography, and an index.  Einstein would go on to keep a journal for all succeeding trips abroad, and this first volume of his travel diaries offers an initial, intimate glimpse into a brilliant mind encountering the great, wide world.","","9781400889952","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453413.pdf&bkn=9453412&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Not all topics that are part of today's elementary mathematics were always considered as such, and great mathematical advances and discoveries had to occur in order for certain subjects to become ""elementary."" Stillwell examines elementary mathematics from a distinctive twenty-first-century viewpoint and describes not only the beauty and scope of the discipline, but also its limits.From Gaussian integers to propositional logic, Stillwell delves into arithmetic, computation, algebra, geometry, calculus, combinatorics, probability, and logic. He discusses how each area ties into more advanced topics to build mathematics as a whole. Through a rich collection of basic principles, vivid examples, and interesting problems, Stillwell demonstrates that elementary mathematics becomes advanced with the intervention of infinity. Infinity has been observed throughout mathematical history, but the recent development of ""reverse mathematics"" confirms that infinity is essential for proving well-known theorems, and helps to determine the nature, contours, and borders of elementary mathematics.Elements of Mathematics gives readers, from high school students to professional mathematicians, the highlights of elementary mathematics and glimpses of the parts of math beyond its boundaries.","","9781400880560","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452564.pdf&bkn=9452563&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"The Little Book of Black Holes","S. S. Gubser; F. Pretorius",NA; NA,"The Little Book of Black Holes","","2018","","","","","Dive into a mind-bending exploration of the physics of black holesBlack holes, predicted by Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity more than a century ago, have long intrigued scientists and the public with their bizarre and fantastical properties. Although Einstein understood that black holes were mathematical solutions to his equations, he never accepted their physical reality—a viewpoint many shared. This all changed in the 1960s and 1970s, when a deeper conceptual understanding of black holes developed just as new observations revealed the existence of quasars and X-ray binary star systems, whose mysterious properties could be explained by the presence of black holes. Black holes have since been the subject of intense research—and the physics governing how they behave and affect their surroundings is stranger and more mind-bending than any fiction.After introducing the basics of the special and general theories of relativity, this book describes black holes both as astrophysical objects and theoretical “laboratories” in which physicists can test their understanding of gravitational, quantum, and thermal physics. From Schwarzschild black holes to rotating and colliding black holes, and from gravitational radiation to Hawking radiation and information loss, Steven Gubser and Frans Pretorius use creative thought experiments and analogies to explain their subject accessibly. They also describe the decades-long quest to observe the universe in gravitational waves, which recently resulted in the LIGO observatories’ detection of the distinctive gravitational wave “chirp” of two colliding black holes—the first direct observation of black holes’ existence.The Little Book of Black Holes takes readers deep into the mysterious heart of the subject, offering rare clarity of insight into the physics that makes black holes simple yet destructive manifestations of geometric destiny.","","9781400888290","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452558.pdf&bkn=9452557&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Causation in Science","Y. Ben-Menahem",NA,"Causation in Science","","2018","","","","","This book explores the role of causal constraints in science, shifting our attention from causal relations between individual events--the focus of most philosophical treatments of causation—to a broad family of concepts and principles generating constraints on possible change. Yemima Ben-Menahem looks at determinism, locality, stability, symmetry principles, conservation laws, and the principle of least action—causal constraints that serve to distinguish events and processes that our best scientific theories mandate or allow from those they rule out.Ben-Menahem's approach reveals that causation is just as relevant to explaining why certain events fail to occur as it is to explaining events that do occur. She investigates the conceptual differences between, and interrelations of, members of the causal family, thereby clarifying problems at the heart of the philosophy of science. Ben-Menahem argues that the distinction between determinism and stability is pertinent to the philosophy of history and the foundations of statistical mechanics, and that the interplay of determinism and locality is crucial for understanding quantum mechanics. Providing historical perspective, she traces the causal constraints of contemporary science to traditional intuitions about causation, and demonstrates how the teleological appearance of some constraints is explained away in current scientific theories such as quantum mechanics.Causation in Science represents a bold challenge to both causal eliminativism and causal reductionism—the notions that causation has no place in science and that higher-level causal claims are reducible to the causal claims of fundamental physics.","","9781400889297","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452522.pdf&bkn=9452521&pdfType=book","causal constraints;science;causation;locality;determinism;stability;quantum mechanics;statistical mechanics;causal eliminativism;causal reductionism;symmetries;conservation laws;variation principles;causal relations;change;necessity;Bertrand Russell;directionality;teleology;fate;physical theories;instability;physics;probability;dynamics;teleological thinking;nonlocality;indeterminism;Heisenberg uncertainty relations;Erwin Schrödinger;I.

"Our Cosmic Habitat: New Edition","M. Rees; M. Rees",NA; NA,"Our Cosmic Habitat: New Edition","","2018","","","","","Our universe seems strangely ''biophilic,'' or hospitable to life. Is this happenstance, providence, or coincidence? According to cosmologist Martin Rees, the answer depends on the answer to another question, the one posed by Einstein's famous remark: ''What interests me most is whether God could have made the world differently.'' This highly engaging book explores the fascinating consequences of the answer being ''yes.'' Rees explores the notion that our universe is just a part of a vast ''multiverse,'' or ensemble of universes, in which most of the other universes are lifeless. What we call the laws of nature would then be no more than local bylaws, imposed in the aftermath of our own Big Bang. In this scenario, our cosmic habitat would be a special, possibly unique universe where the prevailing laws of physics allowed life to emerge. Rees begins by exploring the nature of our solar system and examining a range of related issues such as whether our universe is or isn't infinite. He asks, for example: How likely is life? How credible is the Big Bang theory? Rees then peers into the long-range cosmic future before tracing the causal chain backward to the beginning. He concludes by trying to untangle the paradoxical notion that our entire universe, stretching 10 billion light-years in all directions, emerged from an infinitesimal speck. As Rees argues, we may already have intimations of other universes. But the fate of the multiverse concept depends on the still-unknown bedrock nature of space and time on scales a trillion trillion times smaller than atoms, in the realm governed by the quantum physics of gravity. Expanding our comprehension of the cosmos, Our Cosmic Habitat will be read and enjoyed by all those--scientists and nonscientists alike--who are as fascinated by the universe we inhabit as is the author himself.","","9781400888986","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452384.pdf&bkn=9452383&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Malthus's Essay is also persistently misunderstood. First published anonymously in 1798, the Essay systematically argues that population growth tends to outpace its means of subsistence unless kept in check by factors such as disease, famine, or war, or else by lowering the birth rate through such means as sexual abstinence.Challenging the widely held notion that Malthus's Essay was a product of the British and European context in which it was written, Alison Bashford and Joyce Chaplin demonstrate that it was the new world, as well as the old, that fundamentally shaped Malthus's ideas. They explore what the Atlantic and Pacific new worlds—from the Americas and the Caribbean to New Zealand and Tahiti—meant to Malthus, and how he treated them in his Essay. Bashford and Chaplin reveal how Malthus, long vilified as the scourge of the English poor, drew from his principle of population to conclude that the extermination of native populations by European settlers was unjust.Elegantly written and forcefully argued, The New Worlds of Thomas Robert Malthus relocates Malthus's Essay from the British economic and social context that has dominated its reputation to the colonial and global history that inspired its genesis.","","9781400880959","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453344.pdf&bkn=9453343&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

How can all collaborators’ concerns be adequately addressed? Why do certain STEM collaborations succeed while others fail?Focusing on the nascent science of team science,The Strength in Numbers synthesizes the results of the most far-reaching study to date on collaboration among university scientists to provide answers to such questions. Drawing on a national survey with responses from researchers at more than one hundred universities, anonymous web posts, archival data, and extensive interviews with active scientists and engineers in over a dozen STEM disciplines, Barry Bozeman and Jan Youtie set out a framework to characterize different types of collaboration and their likely outcomes. They also develop a model to define research effectiveness, which assesses factors internal and external to collaborations. They advance what they have found to be the gold standard of science collaborations: consultative collaboration management. This strategy—which codifies methods of consulting all team members on a study’s key points and incorporates their preferences and values—empowers managers of STEM collaborations to optimize the likelihood of their effectiveness.The Strength in Numbers is a milestone in the science of team science and an indispensable guide for scientists interested in maximizing collaborative success.","","9781400888610","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452410.pdf&bkn=9452409&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

This groundbreaking book is the first to reconstruct Ptolemy’s general philosophical system—including his metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics—and to explore its relationship to astronomy, harmonics, element theory, astrology, cosmology, psychology, and theology.In this stimulating intellectual history, Jacqueline Feke uncovers references to a complex and sophisticated philosophical agenda scattered among Ptolemy’s technical studies in the physical and mathematical sciences. She shows how he developed a philosophy that was radical and even subversive, appropriating ideas and turning them against the very philosophers from whom he drew influence. Feke reveals how Ptolemy’s unique system is at once a critique of prevailing philosophical trends and a conception of the world in which mathematics reigns supreme.A compelling work of scholarship, Ptolemy’s Philosophy demonstrates how Ptolemy situated mathematics at the very foundation of all philosophy—theoretical and practical—and advanced the mathematical way of life as the true path to human perfection.","","9780691184036","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452482.pdf&bkn=9452481&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Everything from drafting a PowerPoint presentation to planning a state-of-the-art bridge embodies this universal human activity. But what makes a great design? In this compelling and wide-ranging look at the essence of invention, distinguished engineer and author Henry Petroski argues that, time and again, we have built success on the back of failure--not through easy imitation of success. Success through Failure shows us that making something better--by carefully anticipating and thus averting failure--is what invention and design are all about. Petroski explores the nature of invention and the character of the inventor through an unprecedented range of both everyday and extraordinary examples--illustrated lectures, child-resistant packaging for drugs, national constitutions, medical devices, the world's tallest skyscrapers, long-span bridges, and more. Stressing throughout that there is no surer road to eventual failure than modeling designs solely on past successes, he sheds new light on spectacular failures, from the destruction of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 and the space shuttle disasters of recent decades, to the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001. Petroski also looks at the prehistoric and ancient roots of many modern designs. The historical record, especially as embodied in failures, reveals patterns of human social behavior that have implications for large structures like bridges and vast organizations like NASA. Success through Failure--which will fascinate anyone intrigued by design, including engineers, architects, and designers themselves--concludes by speculating on when we can expect the next major bridge failure to occur, and the kind of bridge most likely to be involved.","","9781400889686","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453294.pdf&bkn=9453293&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality","P. S. Churchland; P. S. Churchland",NA; NA,"Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality","","2018","","","","","What is morality? Where does it come from? And why do most of us heed its call most of the time? In Braintrust, neurophilosophy pioneer Patricia Churchland argues that morality originates in the biology of the brain. She describes the ""neurobiological platform of bonding"" that, modified by evolutionary pressures and cultural values, has led to human styles of moral behavior. The result is a provocative genealogy of morals that asks us to reevaluate the priority given to religion, absolute rules, and pure reason in accounting for the basis of morality. Moral values, Churchland argues, are rooted in a behavior common to all mammals--the caring for offspring. The evolved structure, processes, and chemistry of the brain incline humans to strive not only for self-preservation but for the well-being of allied selves--first offspring, then mates, kin, and so on, in wider and wider ""caring"" circles. Separation and exclusion cause pain, and the company of loved ones causes pleasure; responding to feelings of social pain and pleasure, brains adjust their circuitry to local customs. In this way, caring is apportioned, conscience molded, and moral intuitions instilled. A key part of the story is oxytocin, an ancient body-and-brain molecule that, by decreasing the stress response, allows humans to develop the trust in one another necessary for the development of close-knit ties, social institutions, and morality. A major new account of what really makes us moral, Braintrust challenges us to reconsider the origins of some of our most cherished values.","","9781400889389","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452456.pdf&bkn=9452455&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Music by the Numbers: From Pythagoras to Schoenberg","E. Maor",NA,"Music by the Numbers: From Pythagoras to Schoenberg","","2018","","","","","How music has influenced mathematics, physics, and astronomy from ancient Greece to the twentieth centuryMusic is filled with mathematical elements, the works of Bach are often said to possess a math-like logic, and Igor Stravinsky said ""musical form is close to mathematics,"" while Arnold Schoenberg, Iannis Xenakis, and Karlheinz Stockhausen went further, writing music explicitly based on mathematical principles. Yet Eli Maor argues that music has influenced math at least as much as math has influenced music. Starting with Pythagoras, proceeding through the work of Schoenberg, and ending with contemporary string theory, Music by the Numbers tells a fascinating story of composers, scientists, inventors, and eccentrics who played a role in the age-old relationship between music, mathematics, and the sciences, especially physics and astronomy. Music by the Numbers explores key moments in this history, particularly how problems originating in music have inspired mathematicians for centuries. Perhaps the most famous of these problems is the vibrating string, which pitted some of the greatest mathematicians of the eighteenth century against each other in a debate that lasted more than fifty years and that eventually led to the development of post-calculus mathematics. Other highlights in the book include a comparison between meter in music and metric in geometry, complete with examples of rhythmic patterns from Bach to Stravinsky, and an exploration of a suggestive twentieth-century development: the nearly simultaneous emergence of Einstein's theory of relativity and Schoenberg's twelve-tone system.Weaving these compelling historical episodes with Maor's personal reflections as a mathematician and lover of classical music, Music by the Numbers will delight anyone who loves mathematics and music.","","9781400889891","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453280.pdf&bkn=9453279&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

But how does science really work? Is it truly as healthy as we tend to think? How does the system itself shape what scientists do? The Secret Life of Science takes a clear-eyed and provocative look at the current state of global science, shedding light on a cutthroat and tightly tensioned enterprise that even scientists themselves often don't fully understand.The Secret Life of Science is a dispatch from the front lines of modern science. It paints a startling picture of a complex scientific ecosystem that has become the most competitive free-market environment on the planet. It reveals how big this ecosystem really is, what motivates its participants, and who reaps the rewards. Are there too few scientists in the world or too many? Are some fields expanding at the expense of others? What science is shared or published, and who determines what the public gets to hear about? What is the future of science? Answering these and other questions, this controversial book explains why globalization is not necessarily good for science, nor is the continued growth in the number of scientists. It portrays a scientific community engaged in a race for limited resources that determines whether careers are lost or won, whose research visions become the mainstream, and whose vested interests end up in control.The Secret Life of Science explains why this hypercompetitive environment is stifling the diversity of research and the resiliency of science itself, and why new ideas are needed to ensure that the scientific enterprise remains healthy and vibrant.","","9781400889303","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452560.pdf&bkn=9452559&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

This book tells the story of ten great ideas about chance and the thinkers who developed them, tracing the philosophical implications of these ideas as well as their mathematical impact.Persi Diaconis and Brian Skyrms begin with Gerolamo Cardano, a sixteenth-century physician, mathematician, and professional gambler who helped develop the idea that chance actually can be measured.

Porter",NA,"Genetics in the Madhouse: The Unknown History of Human Heredity","","2018","","","","","The untold story of how hereditary data in mental hospitals gave rise to the science of human heredityIn the early 1800s, a century before there was any concept of the gene, physicians in insane asylums began to record causes of madness in their admission books. Almost from the beginning, they pointed to heredity as the most important of these causes. As doctors and state officials steadily lost faith in the capacity of asylum care to stem the terrible increase of insanity, they began emphasizing the need to curb the reproduction of the insane. They became obsessed with identifying weak or tainted families and anticipating the outcomes of their marriages. Genetics in the Madhouse is the untold story of how the collection and sorting of hereditary data in mental hospitals, schools for ""feebleminded"" children, and prisons gave rise to a new science of human heredity.In this compelling book, Theodore Porter draws on untapped archival evidence from across Europe and North America to bring to light the hidden history behind modern genetics. He looks at the institutional use of pedigree charts, censuses of mental illness, medical-social surveys, and other data techniques--innovative quantitative practices that were worked out in the madhouse long before the manipulation of DNA became possible in the lab. Porter argues that asylum doctors developed many of the ideologies and methods of what would come to be known as eugenics, and deepens our appreciation of the moral issues at stake in data work conducted on the border of subjectivity and science.A bold rethinking of asylum work, Genetics in the Madhouse shows how heredity was a human science as well as a medical and biological one.","","9781400890507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453378.pdf&bkn=9453377&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Based on a popular Harvard University course taught by the author, this book gives a concise introduction to recent discoveries concerning the structure of gravity and gauge theory at very long distances. These discoveries unite three disparate but well-developed subjects in physics. The first subject is the soft theorems, which were found by particle physicists in the 1950s to control the behavior of low-energy photons and are essential for all collider predictions. The second subject is asymptotic symmetries, found by general relativists in the 1960s to provide a surprising, infinite number of exact relations between distinct physical phenomena. The third subject is the memory effect, the measurement of which is sought in upcoming gravitational wave observations. An exploration of the physical and mathematical equivalence of these three subjects has provided a powerful new perspective on old results and led to a plethora of new results, involving symmetries of QED, gluon scattering amplitudes, flat-space holography in quantum gravity, black hole information, and beyond. Uniquely connective and cutting-edge, Lectures on the Infrared Structure of Gravity and Gauge Theory takes students and scholars to the forefront of new developments in the discipline.

They are governed by the Euler equations or their variants, generally in the form of nonlinear conservation laws—PDEs of divergence form. When a shock hits an obstacle, shock reflection-diffraction configurations take shape. To understand the fundamental issues involved, such as the structure and transition criteria of different configuration patterns, it is essential to establish the global existence, regularity, and structural stability of shock reflection-diffraction solutions. This involves dealing with several core difficulties in the analysis of nonlinear PDEs—mixed type, free boundaries, and corner singularities—that also arise in fundamental problems in diverse areas such as continuum mechanics, differential geometry, mathematical physics, and materials science.

"Reverse Mathematics: Proofs from the Inside Out","J. Stillwell",NA,"Reverse Mathematics: Proofs from the Inside Out","","2018","","","","","This book presents reverse mathematics to a general mathematical audience for the first time. Reverse mathematics is a new field that answers some old questions. In the two thousand years that mathematicians have been deriving theorems from axioms, it has often been asked: which axioms are needed to prove a given theorem? Only in the last two hundred years have some of these questions been answered, and only in the last forty years has a systematic approach been developed. In Reverse Mathematics, John Stillwell gives a representative view of this field, emphasizing basic analysis—finding the “right axioms” to prove fundamental theorems—and giving a novel approach to logic.Stillwell introduces reverse mathematics historically, describing the two developments that made reverse mathematics possible, both involving the idea of arithmetization. The first was the nineteenth-century project of arithmetizing analysis, which aimed to define all concepts of analysis in terms of natural numbers and sets of natural numbers. The second was the twentieth-century arithmetization of logic and computation. Thus arithmetic in some sense underlies analysis, logic, and computation. Reverse mathematics exploits this insight by viewing analysis as arithmetic extended by axioms about the existence of infinite sets. Remarkably, only a small number of axioms are needed for reverse mathematics, and, for each basic theorem of analysis, Stillwell finds the “right axiom” to prove it.By using a minimum of mathematical logic in a well-motivated way, Reverse Mathematics will engage advanced undergraduates and all mathematicians interested in the foundations of mathematics.","","9781400889037","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452340.pdf&bkn=9452339&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

McIntyre",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Small Wars, Big Data: The Information Revolution in Modern Conflict","","2018","","","","","How a new understanding of warfare can help the military fight today’s conflicts more effectivelyThe way wars are fought has changed starkly over the past sixty years. International military campaigns used to play out between large armies at central fronts. Today's conflicts find major powers facing rebel insurgencies that deploy elusive methods, from improvised explosives to terrorist attacks. Small Wars, Big Data presents a transformative understanding of these contemporary confrontations and how they should be fought. The authors show that a revolution in the study of conflict--enabled by vast data, rich qualitative evidence, and modern methods—yields new insights into terrorism, civil wars, and foreign interventions. Modern warfare is not about struggles over territory but over people; civilians—and the information they might choose to provide—can turn the tide at critical junctures.The authors draw practical lessons from the past two decades of conflict in locations ranging from Latin America and the Middle East to Central and Southeast Asia. Building an information-centric understanding of insurgencies, the authors examine the relationships between rebels, the government, and civilians. This approach serves as a springboard for exploring other aspects of modern conflict, including the suppression of rebel activity, the role of mobile communications networks, the links between aid and violence, and why conventional military methods might provide short-term success but undermine lasting peace. Ultimately the authors show how the stronger side can almost always win the villages, but why that does not guarantee winning the war. Small Wars, Big Data provides groundbreaking perspectives for how small wars can be better strategized and favorably won to the benefit of the local population.","","9781400890118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452518.pdf&bkn=9452517&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

This paper first presents pre-trial results by which elderly people assigned a lower rating to a conversation with two robots than to one with a single robot. Observations of the trial suggest the hypothesis that an inappropriate spatial arrangement between robots and humans increases the workload in a conversation. Reducing the workload is important, especially when robots are used by elderly people. Therefore, we specifically examine the workload that is influenced by the spatial arrangement in group conversation. To verify the hypothesis, we use a NASA-TLX and a dual-task method to evaluate the workload and to conduct a comparative experiment in which the participant talks with two robots in two spatial arrangements. We also conduct a case study for elderly people in the same conversational conditions. From these experiments, we demonstrate that the spatial arrangement in which people cannot see both robots simultaneously increases their conversational workload and decreases their evaluation of the dialogue compared to a spatial arrangement by which people can see both robots simultaneously. We also show that the primary cause of the workload by positioning is not physical but mental.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473690","Workload in conversation;F-formation;Multi-robot conversation","Senior citizens;Human-robot interaction;Timing;Robots","","","","","","43","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, what makes a robot appear human-like has been driven by designers’ and researchers’ intuitions, because a systematic understanding of the range, variety, and relationships among constituent features of anthropomorphic robots is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce the ABOT (Anthropomorphic roBOT) Database—a collection of 200 images of real-world robots with one or more human-like appearance features (http://www.abotdatabase.info). Harnessing this database, Study 1 uncovered four distinct appearance dimensions (i.e., bundles of features) that characterize a wide spectrum of anthropomorphic robots and Study 2 identified the dimensions and specific features that were most predictive of robots’ perceived human-likeness. With data from both studies, we then created an online estimation tool to help researchers predict how human-like a new robot will be perceived given the presence of various appearance features. The present research sheds new light on what makes a robot look human, and makes publicly accessible a powerful new tool for future research on robots’ human-likeness.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","Office of Naval Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473560","robot database;anthropomorphic robots;human-likeness;social robots","Systematics;Databases;Human-robot interaction;Estimation;Tools;Robots;Faces","","","","","","38","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Privacy concern is an additional issue since most social robots rely on the visual information for the interactions. To this end, we propose ‘Fribo’, auditory information centered social robot that recognizes user’s activity by analyzing occupants’ living noise and shares the activity information with close friends. A four-week field study with the first prototype of Fribo confirms that activity sharing through the use of anonymized living noise promises a virtual cohabiting experience that triggers more frequent real-world social interactions with less feeling of privacy intrusion.

Priming, evoking activity in a person by exposing them to learned stimuli, is one way of shaping someone’s perception. We investigate priming an operator’s impression of a robot’s physical capabilities in order to impact their perception of the robot and teleoperation behavior; that is, we examine if we can change operator driving behavior simply by making them believe that a robot is dangerous or safe, fast or slow, etc., without actually changing robot capability.

We found that the timing of the errors matters: replicating previous research, conversational errors reduce the robot’s influence in the second task, but not on the first task. Social dialogue interacts with the timing of errors, acting as an intensifier: social dialogue helps the robot recover from prior errors, and actually boosts subsequent influence; but social dialogue backfires if it is followed by errors, because it extends the period of good performance, creating a stronger contrast effect with the subsequent errors. The design of social robots should therefore be more careful to avoid errors after periods of good performance than early on in a dialogue.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473685","Social robots;influence;social dialogue;rapport;errors","Human-robot interaction;Timing;Task analysis;Robots","","","","","","49","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method avoids recording a training database in all the possible acoustic environments given an HRI scenario. Moreover, different speech recognition testing conditions were produced by recording two types of acoustics sources, i.e. a loudspeaker and human speakers, using a Microso.

In this generic HRI scenario, the resulting automatic speech recognition engine provided a word error rate that is at least 26% and 38% lower than publicly available speech recognition APIs with the playback (i.e. loudspeaker) and human testing databases, respectively, with a limited amount of training data.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473568","DNN-HMM;time-varying acoustic channel;speech recognition","Training;Loudspeakers;Databases;Error analysis;Training data;Robot sensing systems;Acoustics","","","","","","77","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, comparisons are far less informative. We propose that there is much richer information that users can easily provide and that robots ought to leverage.

Objective functions are typically parametrized in terms of features, which capture aspects of the task that might be important. When the person intervenes to correct the robot’s behavior, the robot should update its understanding of which features matter, how much, and in what way. Unfortunately, real users do not provide optimal corrections that isolate exactly what the robot was doing wrong. Thus, when receiving a correction, it is difficult for the robot to determine which features the person meant to correct, and which features were changed unintentionally. In this paper, we propose to improve the efficiency of robot learning during physical interactions by reducing unintended learning. Our approach allows the human-robot team to focus on learning one feature at a time, unlike state-of-the-art techniques that update all features at once. We derive an online method for identifying the single feature which the human is trying to change during physical interaction, and experimentally compare this one-at-a-time approach to the all-at-once baseline in a user study.

We varied who had access to the key to examine effects of resource accessibility in distributed groups: in the Robot Information condition, the remote pilot (RP) possessed the key; in the Shared Information condition, all team members possessed the key; in the Local Information condition, only collocated participants (CPs) possessed the key.

In contrast to artificial sounds (e.g., beeps and whistles), these signals are primarily functional, providing information about the robot’s actions and state. We analyze the effects of two variations of robot sound, tonal and broadband, on auditory localization during a human-robot collaboration task.

Children were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions. In the mediation condition, Keepon directed the play session flow by indicating when and which activity to switch to, and whenever possible, signaled the onset of object possession conflicts that occurred between the pair and offered prompts for constructive conflict resolution. In the control condition, Keepon only facilitated and directed the play session and did not intervene during children’s conflicts. Results show that children were more likely to resolve conflicts constructively in the mediation condition than in the control condition, and that a key function for a robot mediator within the conflict process is to successfully flag the conflict onset.

Mastery of this skill marks a significant milestone in the human developmental process. A key challenge in designing such an ability in autonomous robots is discovering the relationships among discriminatory features. Identifying features in natural scenes that are representative of a particular event or interaction (i.e. ‘discriminatory features’) and then discovering the relationships (e.g., temporal/spatial/spatiotemporal/causal) among those features in the form of generalized rules are non-trivial problems. They often appear as a ’chicken-and-egg’ dilemma. This paper proposes an end-to-end learning framework to tackle these two problems in the context of learning generalized, high-level rules of human interactions from structured demonstrations. We employed our proposed deep reinforcement learning framework to learn a set of rules that govern a behavioral intervention session between two agents based on observations of several instances of the session.

In this paper, we present the results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment that examined human ISA use in scenarios that did or did not have conventionalized social norms, and analyzed both ISA use and perceptions of robots when robots were or were not capable of understanding ISAs.

Existing frameworks for generating intent-expressive robot behaviors have typically focused on applications in static or structured environments. Under such settings, emphasis is placed towards communicating the robot’s intended final configuration to other agents. However, in dynamic, unstructured and multi-agent domains, such as pedestrian environments, knowledge of the robot’s final configuration is not sufficiently informative as it completely ignores the complex dynamics of interaction among agents. To address this problem, we design a planning framework that aims at generating motion that clearly communicates an agent’s intended collision avoidance strategy rather than its destination. Our framework estimates the most likely intended avoidance protocols of others based on their past behaviors, superimposes them, and generates an expressive and socially compliant robot action that reinforces the expectations of others regarding these avoidance protocols. This action facilitates inference and decision making for everyone, as illustrated in the simplified topological pattern of agents’ trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves significantly lower topological complexity, compared against common benchmark approaches in multi-agent collision avoidance. The significance of this result for real world applications is demonstrated by a user study that reveals statistical evidence suggesting that multi-agent trajectories of lower topological complexity tend to facilitate inference for observers.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473631","Navigation;Expressive motion;Multi-Agent Systems;Topology","Robot motion;Protocols;Navigation;Dynamics;Observers;Planning;Trajectory","","","","","","38","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the core of the architecture lies a novel stochastic decision-making mechanism that implements a partially observable Markov decision process anticipating a human’s state of mind in two-stages. In the first stage it anticipates the human’s task related availability, intent (motivation), and capability during the collaboration. In the second, it further reasons about these states to anticipate the human’s true need for help. Our contribution lies in the ability of our model to handle these unexpected conditions: 1) when the human’s intention is estimated to be irrelevant to the assigned task and may be unknown to the robot, e.g., motivation is lost, another assignment is received, onset of tiredness, and 2) when the human’s intention is relevant but the human doesn’t want the robot’s assistance in the given context, e.g., because of the human’s changing emotional states or the human’s task-relevant distrust for the robot. Our results show that integrating this model into a robot’s decision-making process increases the efficiency and naturalness of the collaboration.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473814","Human-Robot Collaboration;Anticipatory Decision-Making;Intent Inference","Training;Decision making;Collaboration;Human-robot interaction;Markov processes;Data models;Reflection","","","","","","26","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current strategies, such as one-on-one therapy done in rehabilitation centers, have limitations such as treatment frequency and intensity, cost and requirement of mobility. Thus, a promising strategy is home-based therapy that includes task specific exercises. However, traditional rehabilitation tasks may frustrate the patient due to their repetitive nature and may result in lack of motivation and poor rehabilitation. In this article, we propose the design and verification of an effective upper extremity rehabilitation game with a tangible robotic platform named Cellulo as a novel solution to these issues. We first describe the process of determining the design rationales to tune speed, accuracy and challenge. Then we detail our iterative participatory design process and test sessions conducted with the help of stroke, brachial plexus and cerebral palsy patients (18 in total) and 7 therapists in 4 different therapy centers.

In this talk, I will share more than few of the stories and lessons learned from our experiences. First, these robots need a purpose; they need to provide value to specific people in concrete ways. Beware of novelty effects. Second, especially in the domain of service and consumer robotics, the social skills of the robots are inherently critical aspects of the robots’ ability to function. Socially inappropriate robots get shoved aside, abandoned, and hijacked. Third, building a truly interdisciplinary team has been an incredibly powerful way forward to designing, deploying, and iteratively improving upon building robotic products and services that people actually want to use. Respecting and leveraging the diverse skills on real product teams makes all the difference. Getting robots out of factory cages and into the hands of real end-users takes much more than just a single company. It takes a community. The human-robot interaction community is critical to the success of inventing this future of robotics that supports real human needs, enabling everyday people to benefit from the advances in robotics.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473479","Steve Cousins;Willow Garage;Savioke;Relay;PARC;Robotics;Almaden Research Center;TurtleBot;ROS;PR2;Robots for Humanity","Service robots;Roads;Buildings;Human-robot interaction;Companies;Production facilities;Robots","","","","","","0","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we explore the effects of a robot platform and the think-aloud strategy on learning outcomes in the context of a one-on-one tutoring interaction. Results from a 2x2 between-subjects study (n = 52) indicate that both the robot platform and use of the think-aloud strategy promoted learning gains for children. In particular, the robot platform effectively enhanced immediate learning gains, measured right after the tutoring session, while the think-aloud strategy improved persistent gains as measured approximately one week after the interaction. Moreover, our results show that a social robot strengthened students’ engagement and compliance with the think-aloud support while they performed cognitively demanding tasks.

The current paper investigates whether aggressive behaviour directed towards robots is influenced by the same social processes that guide human bullying behaviour. More specifically, it measured the effects of dehumanisation primes and anthropomorphic qualities of the robot on participants’ verbal abuse of a virtual robotic agents. Contrary to previous findings in human-human interaction, priming participants with power did not result in less mind attribution. However, evidence for dehumanisation was still found, as the less mind participants attributed to the robot, the more aggressive responses they gave. In the main study this effect was moderated by the manipulations of power and robot anthropomorphism; the low anthropomorphic robot in the power prime condition endured significantly less abuse, and mind attribution remained a significant predictor for verbal aggression in all conditions save the low anthropomorphic robot with no prime. It is concluded that dehumanisation occurs in human-robot interaction and that like in human-human interaction, it is linked to aggressive behaviour. Moreover, it is argued that this dehumanisation is different from anthropomorphism as well as human-human dehumanisation, since anthropomorphism itself did not predict aggressive behaviour and dehumanisation of robots was not influenced by primes that have been established in human-human dehumanisation research.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473529","robot bullying;dehumanization;anthropomorphism;mind attribution;verbal aggression","Atmospheric measurements;Current measurement;Human-robot interaction;Particle measurements;Anthropomorphism;Robots","","","","","","68","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our shared-control method, called Shared Dynamic Curves, blends suboptimal user translation and rotation control inputs with known translation and rotation paths needed to complete a task. Shared Dynamic Curves provide a translation and rotation path in space along which the user can easily guide the robot, and this curve can bend and flex in real-time as a dynamical system to pull the user’s motion gracefully toward a goal. We show through a user study that Shared Dynamic Curves affords effective motor learning on certain tasks compared to alternative training methods. We discuss our findings in the context of shared control and speculate on how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios such as job training or stroke rehabilitation.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473833","","Training;Flexible printed circuits;Dynamics;Human-robot interaction;Stroke (medical condition);Real-time systems;Trajectory","","","","","","25","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our results show that over multiple handover interactions with the robot, users gradually perceive the robot receiver as being less discomforting and having more emotional warmth. Additionally, we have found that by varying grasp method and retraction speed, users may hold significantly different judgments of robot competence and discomfort. With these results, we recognize empirically that users are able to develop social perceptions of robots which can change through modification of robot receiving behaviour and through repeated interaction with the robot. More widely, this work suggests that measurement of user social perceptions should play a larger role in the design and evaluation of human-robot interactions and that the RoSAS can serve as a standardized tool in this regard.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","University of British Columbia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473507","Human-Robot Interaction;Human-Robot Handovers;Handovers;Social Perception;Measurement;Robots;Robotics;Psychometric Scale;Social Robots;Social Robotics","Human-robot interaction;Receivers;Handover;Tools;Manipulators;Safety;Robots","","","","","","30","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current privacy legislation in major jurisdictions requires organisations to disclose information about their data collection process and obtain user’s consent prior to collecting privacy sensitive information. In this study, we consider a privacy-sensitive design of a data collection system for face identification. We deployed a face enrolment system on a humanoid robot with human-like gesturing and speech. We compared it with an equivalent system, in terms of capability and interactive process, on a screen-based interactive kiosk. In our previous contribution, we investigated the effects that embodiment has on users’ privacy considerations. We found that an embodied humanoid robot is capable of collecting more private information from users in comparison to a disembodied interactive kiosk. However, this effect was statistically significant only when the two compared systems were using a transparent interface, i.e. an interface communicating to users the privacy policies for data processing and storage. Thus, in this work, we aim to further investigate the effects of transparency on users’ privacy considerations and their experience with robot applications. We found that when comparing a non-transparent vs. transparent interface within the same system (i.e. on an embodied robot or on a disembodied kiosk) transparency does not lead to significant effects on users’ privacy considerations. However, we found that transparency leads to a significantly better user experience for both systems. Therefore, our overall analyses suggest that both the interactive robot and the interactive kiosk are capable of enhancing the user experience by providing transparent information to users, which is required by privacy legislation. However, an interactive kiosk providing transparent information elicits significantly more privacy concerns in users as compared to the robot supplying the very same transparent information. This exploratory study provides conclusions that provide valuable insights for designing robot applications dealing with users privacy and it discusses the related legal implications, concluding with recommendations for privacy policymakers.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473486","privacy-sensitive design;human-robot interaction;User Experience design;privacy considerations;transparency","Privacy;Data privacy;Law;Legislation;Humanoid robots;Data collection;Robot sensing systems","","","","","","33","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One explanation can be made using Hodges and Geyers work [17], in which they propose that people consider distinct criteria (truth, trust, and social solidarity) when deciding whether to conform to others. In order to study how trust and truth affect conformity, we propose an experiment in which participants play a game with three robots, in which there are no objective answers. We measured how many times participants changed their preliminary answers to match the group of robots’ in their final answer. We conducted a between-subjects study (N = 30) in which there were two conditions: one in which participants saw the group of robots’ preliminary answer before deciding their final answer, and a control condition in which they did not know the robots’ preliminary answer. Participants in the experimental condition conformed significantly more (29%) than participants in the control condition (6%). Therefore we have shown that groups of robots can cause people to conform to them. Additionally trust plays a role in conformity: initially, participants conformed to robots at a similar rate to Asch’s participants, however, many participants stop conforming later in the game when trust is lost due to the robots choosing an incorrect answer.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473638","Conformity;Human-Robot Groups;Trust","Atmospheric measurements;Human-robot interaction;Games;Particle measurements;Task analysis;Robots","","","","","","27","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such robots are in urgent need of finding effective ways to present themselves and communicate their intentions due to a lack of social expressivity. We particularly focus on the expression of attractiveness and hostility because a robot would need to be able to attract or keep away human users in practical human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. In this work, we installed an LED lighting system on a Roomba robot and conducted a series of two experiments. We first worked through a structured approach to determine the best light expression designs for the robot to show attractiveness and hostility. This resulted in four recommended light expressions. Further, we performed a verification study to examine the effectiveness of such light expressions in a typical HRI context.

Based on emotion metaphors that capture mental models of emotions, we systematically designed and validated a set of 28 different uni- and multimodal expressions for the basic emotions joy, sadness, fear and anger using the most common output modalities color, motion and sound. Classification accuracy and users’ confidence of emotion assignment were evaluated in an empirical study with 33 participants and a robot probe. The findings are distilled into a set of recommendations about which modalities are most effective in communicating basic artificial emotion. Combining color with planar motion offered the overall best cost/benefit ratio by making use of redundant multi-modal coding. Furthermore, modalities differed in their degree of effectiveness to communicate single emotions. Joy was best conveyed via color and motion, sadness via sound, fear via motion and anger via color.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473583","Robotics;social robots;emotion;color;sound;motion;human-robot interaction;non-humanoids;human-agent interaction;multimodal interaction;affective computing","Temperature;Atmospheric measurements;Humanoid robots;Human-robot interaction;Color;Particle measurements;Encoding","","","","","","54","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking inspiration from peripersonal space representations in humans, we present a framework on a humanoid robot that dynamically maintains such a protective safety zone, composed of the following main components: (i) a human 2D keypoints estimation pipeline employing a deep learning based algorithm, extended here into 3D using disparity; (ii) a distributed peripersonal space representation around the robot's body parts; (iii) a reaching controller that incorporates all obstacles entering the robot's safety zone on the fly into the task. Pilot experiments demonstrate that an effective safety margin between the robot's and the human's body parts is kept. The proposed solution is flexible and versatile since the safety zone around individual robot and human body parts can be selectively modulated—here we demonstrate stronger avoidance of the human head compared to rest of the body. Our system works in real time and is self-contained, with no external sensory equipment and use of onboard cameras only.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4953-6","","Marie Curie; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473679","peripersonal space;physical human-robot interaction;deep learning for robotics;human keypoints estimation;whole-body awareness;margin of safety;humanoid robots","Three-dimensional displays;Robot vision systems;Pipelines;Humanoid robots;Human-robot interaction;Aerospace electronics;Real-time systems","","","","","","38","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, ultra-high frequency (UHF) (840-960 MHz) near- field (NF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems have attracted increasing attention because of the possibility of achieving much higher reading speeds and capability to detect a larger number of tags (bulk reading). A UHF NF RFID system is a valuable solution to implement a reliable short-range wireless link (up to a few tens of centimeters) for ILT applications. Since the tags can be made smaller, RFID-based applications can be extended to extremely small items (e.g., retail apparel, jewelry, drugs, rented apparel) as well as to successful implementations of RFID-based storage spaces, smart conveyor belts, and shopping carts. This course aims at introducing the RFID technology, focusing on near-field systems and applications. A detailed overview of ad hoc NF reader antennas is proposed, highlighting their main characteristics and achievable performance. The future trends of these systems are also discussed together with their potentialities and advantages.","","9788793609730","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450141.pdf&bkn=9431971&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Analogue building blocks for neural-inspired circuits","H. Heidari; S. Ghoreishizadeh",NA; NA,"Circuits and Systems for Biomedical Applications","","2018","","","71","88","Hardware implementation of neural networks is an increasingly popular area, both in research and industry. The main motivation is the amazing computational efficiency of the brain together with its self-repairing capability. The subject of artificial neural networks has a long history and much of the advance has been in software environments. Highly complex ‘hidden layers’ of synapses and neurons can be trained in so-called deep learning applications. Implementation in hardware however can bring significant advances in speed. Spiking neural networks (SNN) encode information in the timing of single spikes, and not just in their statistical firing rate [1]. Furthermore, recent neuroscience research has shown that SNNs mimic neuron behaviour on a level more closely related to biology and so have the propensity for powerful computational ability compared to classic artificial neural networks. Simulation platforms have been developed to allow investigation of the role played by spike-timing in the field of computational neuroscience [2]. Hardware approaches based on FPGAs, GPUs and ARM processor cores have been developed for hardware accelerated simulation which could offer such capability at the expense of large silicon area and low energy efficiency [3–5]. Good reviews of the current progress of hardware SNN development can be found in [6–8]. Different neuron models have been adopted varying from very detailed conductance-based approaches to simpler leaky integrate and fire versions. Conductance-based models emulate biophysical ion channels and hence are more faithful to biology. The integrate and fire models are somewhat less biologically realistic but require fewer transistors and can therefore be facilitated with compact layouts with low energy consumption. Thus, designers can balance accuracy with a higher number of neurons in the network, bringing the potential for better scalability. Each of the different implementations offers some trade-off between scalability, latency and biological realism. Finding an appropriate balance between these three elements represents one of the key challenges of hardware SNNs. In this chapter, the integrate and fire approach is explained. A library of dynamically operating analogue functional blocks is described, based on principles, to emulate synaptic behaviour, spike-dependent plasticity, synaptic fan-in, axonal delay and spike bursts. Some schemes for scaling are also described. Finally, ideas for modelling of synaptic self- repair mediated by so-called astrocytes are presented. References to associated publications can be found in the slide set.","","9788770220521","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450201.pdf&bkn=9431969&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

For battery-less devices, RadioFrequency IDentification (RFID) tags seem to be a major player currently used for identification purposes, but some advanced researches demonstrated its ability to perform additional duties, in particular sensing.

The advantages and drawbacks are discussed. Afterward, the most popular approaches to synthesize a chipless RFID are addressed both in time domain (TD) and in frequency domain (FD). The former approach is described in detail with several examples related to information encoding schemes and sensing applications. Both passive or semi-passive TD tags are described. The last part of the chapter is dedicated to the description of FD tags, where the information is usually encoded in the presence or absence of a frequency peak at a predetermined frequency. It is also shown that FD tags can be employed as sensors if the resonator is loaded with a material sensible to an environmental variable such as the humidity level.","","9788793609730","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450199.pdf&bkn=9431971&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

There are many challenges in designing components for such a device, however, the analog front-end circuits located right at the signal source is one of the most critical one to determine the overall performance. This tutorial will focus on low-power CMOS electronics for non-invasive and invasive bio-potential recoding from the central nervous system. Electro-encephalography (EEG) is the most popular method for non-invasive brain imaging but medical grade EEG devices are still bulky and requires frequent professional assistance. However, ambulatory EEG recording is of great interest both for healthcare and life-style applications. We will review the CMOS circuit design techniques to provide high quality EEG data with maximum patient comfort. Similarly, invasive neural recording has been a primary technique used by neurophysiologists to study brain function over many decades. It is only recently that high-density silicon neural probes have become available. The second part of the tutorial will focus on CMOS design methodologies related to such devices.","","9788770220521","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450154.pdf&bkn=9431969&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Unfortunately, the transmission of large amounts of data is typically expensive, not only in terms of communication bandwidth, but also in terms of energy. Hence, smart IoT sensors must extract and send only the essence from the sensor observations. This extraction requires complex near-sensor processing with good energy efficiency, which motivates the research for energy-efficient VLSI design in low-power IoT sensor nodes, using modern sub-100nm process nodes.","","9788793609822","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450159.pdf&bkn=9431974&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

These signals must be accurately digitized for internal processing by baseband or application processors in the SoCs through the analog front-ends (AFEs) which are mainly constituted by the analog signal conditioning circuitries and data converters. Typically, the AFE components are specified in terms of their electrical characteristics, whereas the system designer evaluates the system performance with a different set of metrics. Therefore, system designers must interpret the AFE components' electrical specifications and how they determine the overall performance in units that are meaningful to the system.","","9788793609990","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450155.pdf&bkn=9431976&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

There are many factors that must be taken into consideration when analyzing cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as a patient's quality of life, general well-being, diet, lifestyle, psychosocial effects, medical costs, and many other factors. Pharmaceutical interventions are the primary method of treating heart conditions, however, one of the most popular and widespread methods of treatment which often augments medication is Cardiac Rehabilitation Therapy (CRT). CRT programs have been shown to be an effective secondary prevention method for CVD. It can help reduce patient risk, as well as improve their recovery and overall health outcomes. In this paper, we propose a recommendation system for patient decision support, and a computational model for cardiac rehabilitation planning, in order to personalize and optimize the physical exercise therapy plan offered to patients, to meet their goals and needs. We tested our proposed model against randomly generated exercise plans, and found that our model was able to find the optimal therapy plan with a 43% higher rate of success on average relative to the random model, with regards to meeting patients' goals and needs. We believe our patient-centered solution to CRT will improve patient satisfaction, quality of life, and help reduce costs through improved efficacy and adherence to the therapy program, along with improved post-therapy cardiac health management.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9437568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437568","Cardiac Rehabilitation Therapy;Recommendation System;Decision Support System;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Chatbot","Sentiment analysis;Computational modeling;Medical treatment;Cathode ray tubes;User experience;Planning;Cardiovascular diseases","cardiovascular system;decision support systems;diseases;health care;medical information systems;patient care;patient monitoring;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;telemedicine","post-therapy cardiac health management;artificial intelligence-based cardiac rehabilitation therapy exercise recommendation system;physical exercise therapy plan;cardiac rehabilitation planning;patient decision support;patient risk;effective secondary prevention method;CRT programs;medication;heart conditions;primary method;pharmaceutical interventions;psychosocial effects;CVD;cardiovascular disease;patient-centered solution;optimal therapy plan","","1","","20","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Popular remote sensor data, e.g., hyperspectral (HS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), contain complementary information for land cover if they are co-registered. In this paper, we aim to integrate information extracted from these data sources for land cover classification. At first, we propose a novel feature extraction method by calculating the inverse coefficient of variation (ICV) using the Gaussian probability of neighbourhood between every pair of bands in HS data. This is calculated for each band with respect to every other band to form an ICV cube. We reduce the number of planes in the cube by applying principal component analysis (PCA) on it and spatial features are then extracted for significant principal components. The spectral information from HS data, their ICV responses, and spatial information from ICV responses have complementary information; that is why we fuse them together by layer stacking to generate discriminant features. Secondly, we also derive height and spatial features from LiDAR Digital Elevation Model (DSM), which are later concatenated with the HS derived features. Finally, these features are classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The classification results prove the effectiveness of the derived features from both data sources.","2377-0198","978-1-5386-8479-5","10.1109/PRRS44410.2018.9396733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9396733","Hyperspectral;LiDAR;ICV;PCA;DSM;LDA","Laser radar;Stacking;Probability;Feature extraction;Linear discriminant analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Principal component analysis","digital elevation models;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;image classification;optical radar;principal component analysis;terrain mapping","multisource data;land cover classification;LiDAR data;Co-registered Hyperspectral;data sources;complementary information;spatial information;ICV responses;spectral information;HS data;novel feature extraction method","","","","15","IEEE","8 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Micro- and nanosatellites have become popular platforms for a variety of commercial and scientific applications, but today are considered suitable mainly for short and low-priority space missions due to their low reliability. In part, this can be attributed to their reliance upon cheap, low-feature size, COTS components originally designed for embedded and mobile-market applications, for which traditional hardware-voting concepts are ineffective. Software-fault-tolerance has been shown to be effective for such systems, but have largely been ignored by the space industry due to low maturity, as most have only been researched in theory. In practice, designers of payload instruments and miniaturized satellites are usually forced to sacrifice reliability in favor of delivering the level of performance necessary for cutting-edge science and innovative commercial applications. Thus, we developed a set of software measures facilitating fault tolerance based upon thread-level coarse-grain lockstep, which we validated through fault-injection. To offer strong long-term fault coverage, our architecture is implemented as tiled MPSoC on an FPGA, utilizing partial reconfiguration, as well as mixed criticality. This architecture can satisfy the high performance requirements of current and future scientific and commercial space missions at very low cost, while offering the strong fault-coverage guarantees necessary for platform control even for missions with a long duration. This architecture was developed for a 4-year ESA project. Together with two industrial partners, we are developing a prototype to then undergo radiation testing.","1609-0438","978-1-7281-0216-0","10.1109/RADECS45761.2018.9328685","European Space Agency (ESA) NPI; European Union A-ERC(grant numbers:291141); Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA)(grant numbers:291141); Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences(grant numbers:291141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328685","CubeSat;SmallSat;Nanosatellite;Satellite;System-on-chip;RTOS;FPGA;ARM;Cortex-A53;Microblaze;Xilinx;COTS;partial reconfiguration;forward error correction;fault tolerant systems;fault tolerance;integrated circuit reliability;fault injection;reliability;robustness;software defined fault tolerance","Computer architecture;Software;Field programmable gate arrays;Fault tolerant systems;Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Synchronization","aerospace computing;artificial satellites;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit reliability;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;reconfigurable architectures;software fault tolerance;space vehicle electronics;system-on-chip","software-fault-tolerance;space industry;software measures;thread-level coarse-grain lockstep;fault-injection;long-term fault coverage;scientific space missions;commercial space missions;fault-tolerant nanosatellite computing;on-board computer architecture;commodity hardware;microsatellites;tiled MPSoC;FPGA;partial reconfiguration;mixed criticality;high performance computing;ESA project;multiprocessor system-on-chip;COTS components;commercial off-the-shelf components","","2","","53","IEEE","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel Current Limiter circuit Controlled by Comparators (CLCBC) is proposed to improve SET tolerance of the Charge-Pump (CP). Further a SET tolerant Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) based on an interleaved architecture is also presented. The CLCBC features in being able to detect the abnormal current surged at the CP output node as a result of a SET strike and then to keep this abnormal current from flowing into the low pass filter (LPF) by a high resolution and fast compensation scheme. The VCO consists of a 4-stage interleaved delay buffer implemented to perform the Majority Decision Voting functions without incurring additional signal delay. Such a VCO can generate symmetric multi-phase outputs. Simulation results show that, with deposited charges of 2650fC, the output variation of the CP/ LPF hardened by the proposed CLCBC is reduced by 84.5%, in comparison to the previous work. For the RHBD PLL designed, the perturbation of the VCO control voltage is reduced by 95.6%, while the PLL recovery time is reduced by 68.9%, and the period variation range of the output is reduced by 97%, all with reference to the baseline PLL unhardened. Moreover, the jitter performance of the proposed RHBD PLL remains unaffected and is nearly the same as that of the baseline PLL unhardened.","1609-0438","978-1-7281-0216-0","10.1109/RADECS45761.2018.9328650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328650","RHBD;PLL;SET;CP;CLCBC;VCO;interleaved architecture","Phase locked loops;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Computer architecture;Delays;Microprocessors;Transistors;Simulation","charge pump circuits;CMOS integrated circuits;current limiters;integrated circuit design;jitter;low-pass filters;phase locked loops;radiation hardening (electronics);voltage-controlled oscillators","SET harden phase-locked loop;radiation-hardened-by-design phase-locked loop;CMOS design;single-event transient effect;charge-pump;SET strike;low pass filter;4-stage interleaved delay buffer;VCO control voltage;PLL recovery time;baseline PLL unhardened;RHBD PLL design;majority decision voting functions;SET tolerant voltage-controlled oscillator;current limiter circuit controlled by comparators;CLCBC;perturbation compensated charge pump & interleaved VCO","","1","","10","IEEE","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although flash-based FPGAs and CPLDs are programmable devices, the configuration memory of them is somewhat robust against radiation.

Steady state and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to characterize radiation induced changes to the band structure and carrier dynamics. The effects of electron radiation on low temperature photoluminescence spectra and room temperature carrier dynamics varied with dopant type and density. Steady-state photoluminescence reveals distinct proton exposure effects for p-type materials grown by molecular beam epitaxy compared to n-type structures.

The main characteristics of radiochromic films are the precise, accurate and permanent dose values, ease of handling and data analysis, high spatial resolution and wide range of dose. However, measurements of the trend of the dose in time with radiochromic films are very difficult by means of commercial read-out tools. In this work we propose a new method, for which a National Patent was filed, for the determination of the dose in real-time and by remote control with radiochromic films. This method based on optoelectronic instrumentation, makes radiochromic film dosimetry an ideal technique for radiation hardness quality assurance tests.","1609-0438","978-1-7281-0216-0","10.1109/RADECS45761.2018.9328710","INFN; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328710","Radiochromic Films;Dosimetry;Radiation Hardness Assurance","Dosimetry;Radiation effects;Optical fibers;Real-time systems;Instruments;Sensitivity;Integrated circuits","data analysis;dosimetry;hardness testing;optical sensors;radiation detection;thin film sensors","radiochromic film dosimetry;dose measurements;permanent dose values;data analysis;high spatial resolution;dosimetry method;radiation hardness quality assurance testing;optoelectronic instrumentation","","","","7","IEEE","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce the TMR's overhead, we propose to exploit approximate computing paradigm and, more in particular, the so-called successive approximations technique. The proposed approach, called Approximate TMR (ATMR), leverages the nature of successive approximation technique to improve fault masking. Successive approximation algorithms are based on loop computations that approximate to a final result on each iteration. By varying the number of iterations, one can observe differences in the fault masking and execution time. Therefore, a trade-off has to be identified between the number of iterations (i.e., the degree of the approximation) in the ATMR and its capability on correcting errors. A set of algorithms were implemented as embedded software in the ARM Cortex A9 processor of Xilinx Zynq-7000 series board. Experiments consist of exposing the finned processor to laser pulses at the data cache memory area provoking bit-flips. Results show that the ATMR approach decreases the execution time overhead compared to the classical TMR while keeping an acceptable fault masking rate.","1609-0438","978-1-7281-0216-0","10.1109/RADECS45761.2018.9328687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328687","Fault Tolerance;Single-Event Upset;Approximate Computing;Laser;Fault Injection","Approximation algorithms;Task analysis;Fault tolerant systems;Laser beams;Approximate computing;Semiconductor lasers;Benchmark testing","approximation theory;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;iterative methods;microprocessor chips;radiation hardening (electronics);redundancy","successive approximation algorithms;embedded software;acceptable fault masking rate;multiple bit upset;triple modular redundancy;successive approximations technique;approximate TMR;microprocessors;ARM Cortex A9 processor;Xilinx Zynq-7000 series board;laser pulses;data cache memory area;bit-flips","","2","","12","IEEE","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The degradation of many electrical parameters are scaled according to the NIEL. But along the years, some deviations were observed between the experimentally measured damage factors and the NIEL.

Up to now no clear understanding of this mechanism has been given.

Flash-based FPGA is a golden core for aerospace safety critical applications; however, traditional SET mitigation solutions, such as filter insertion, can lead to performance degradation of the implemented design. In this paper, we provide a new implementation flow that is able to evaluate the SET phenomena considering its specific convergence case and effectively mitigate the SETs without introducing any performance penalization to the original netlist.

The input impedance, voltage, and current transfer function are presented to evaluate the breaker operation. The limitation and minimum slope of the fault conductance have been derived. According to the mathematical results, the breaker is able to interrupt the source current in case of passing a portion above the normal load current or higher. This breaker has a feature that the high gain-reverse current is produced by two secondary windings. The gain reversible current magnitude depends on turn ratio of the three windings. This current reduces the silicon control rectifier (SCR) current less than its holding current with enough time to turn OFF. The breaker clears the fault current in both directions automatically and quickly before the source experiences the abnormal current. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed breaker under fault and load change conditions to verify the mathematical analysis.","","978-4-88686-405-5","10.23919/IPECNiigata2018-ECCE40317.2018.9309129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9309129","DC power system protection;circuit breakers;coupled inductors;fault current limiters;thyristor circuits","Circuit breakers;Impedance;Circuit faults;Capacitors;Inductors;Windings;Transfer functions","capacitors;circuit breakers;fault currents;inductors;mathematical analysis;network topology;thyristors;transfer functions;windings","two sides symmetrical impedance;current transfer function;input impedance;coupled inductors;Y-source impedance network topology;Source Bi-directional DC Circuit Breaker;holding current;silicon control rectifier current;gain reversible current magnitude;high gain-reverse current;breaker operation","","2","","22","","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The 5S system (5S) is a subset of Lean that provides concrete steps to implement Lean [2]. The goal of this research was to implement 5S in a window screen production process to increase screens made per minute. This implementation took place in the Screen Room at the Silverline Building Products (Silverline) production facility in North Brunswick, NJ. It is also projected to earn Silverline 173,000 dollars in additional revenue per year, on average. Surveys of line operators, distance measurements, and time studies revealed that the screen production process was inefficient. The proposed change, a reorganization of the materials needed to produce a screen, reduced production time per screen and decreased the distance traveled by each worker during their shift. These results demonstrate that applying the Lean framework dramatically improves manufacturing processes that rely on human factors.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244796","Lean Manufacturing;Factory Optimization;5S System;Industrial Systems;Operations Research","Manufacturing processes;Profitability;Minimization;Production facilities;Raw materials;Manufacturing;Windows","human factors;lean production;manufacturing industries;manufacturing processes;operations research;optimisation;personnel;production facilities","operations research;New Jersey;North Brunswick;human factors;silverline building product production facility;window screen production process;waste minimization;lean manufacturing methodology;optimizing factory production;lean manufacturing principles;screen room","","","","10","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many tasks that could be readily completed by a human operator typically require a complex combination of sensors and code for a robot to complete autonomously. The purpose of this research was to develop a system in which a robot learned to follow a line the same way that a human would. This was accomplished by training a classification model using recorded images from tele-operation trials by a human operator. The training images were obtained from a forward-facing camera and each image was automatically labeled as one of three steering classes (i.e., straight, left turn, or right turn) based the button pressed on the joystick at the time the image was recorded. The convolutional neural network was built and trained using the Keras Python library with TensorFlow as its backend. The results showed that a model trained to 82% accuracy was able to navigate the course in all 40 trials that were conducted. The ground truth of each trial was recorded via a motion capture system, and a comparison of the human operator trials and the network trials showed little difference between the paths taken.

In addition to harvesting capability, the device can be used to measure the rotating frequency of the equipment being utilized. The device has potential to utilize several piezoelectric beams and corresponding actuating magnets for maximum performance and therefore can generate high power at different rotating frequencies. Thin Lead-Zirconium-Titanate (PZT) piezoelectric cantilever beams were fixed on a stationary wheel. Small magnets were bonded on the tip of the piezoelectric beams. Similar magnets were attached to the rotating pins installed on the moving wheel. The driving magnets attracted the magnets on the cantilever beams when the moving wheel rotated and caused vibration in the cantilever beams. In order to characterize the device, two types of the device layouts including single and double plucking magnets were considered in the tests. The device had room to use up to six plucking magnets and four piezoelectric beams. We tested the harvester at different rotating frequencies, from 180 rpm to 500 rpm and measured voltage outputs as a function of time. We found that the output voltage increased by adding the number of moving magnets and increasing the rotating frequency. In addition, the device was able to accurately measure the rotating frequency of the testing equipment.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244809","energy harvester;piezoelectric;rotating frequency;rotational speed;cantilever beam;magnetic field","Voltage measurement;Magnetic devices;Wheels;Frequency measurement;Energy harvesting;Structural beams;Rotation measurement","beams (structures);cantilevers;energy harvesting;frequency measurement;lead compounds;piezoelectric devices;vibrations","similar magnets;rotating pins;moving wheel;driving magnets;double plucking magnets;piezoelectric beams;rotating frequencies;rotating frequency;dual-purpose piezoelectric multibeam energy harvesting;frequency measurement device;rotational applications;harvesting capability;actuating magnets;rotational energy harvesting device;thin lead-zirconium-titanate piezoelectric cantilever beams","","","","27","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While many approaches employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for optimization given their simplicity and efficiency, they suffer from inconsistencies associated with state uncertainty. This is due to the observability of the system which is not invariant for all transformations when state is filtered through an EKF. In this paper, we address this issue through the use of an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (I-EKF) to address the observability challenge. We derive an IMU factor that does not depend on the assumption that the biases are the same between two sequential keyframes and that the VINS, when given the preintegrated measurements, does not have to separately estimate the state variables. After integrating our algorithm with the open-source parallel tracking and mapping system ORB-SLAM [1], experimental results confirm that our derivation is computationally efficient while demonstrating superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art filtering and graph optimization based VINS.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244777","","Visualization;Uncertainty;Smoothing methods;Filtering;Kalman filters;Observability;Optimization","graph theory;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;optimisation","IMU factor;ORB-SLAM;mapping system;sequential keyframes;tightly coupled Visual Inertial Navigation Systems implementations;Visual observability problem;open-source parallel tracking;state variables;preintegrated measurements;VINS;observability challenge;Invariant Extended Kalman Filter;EKF;state uncertainty","","","","22","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research over the past few decades has explored the prospect of sparsifying DNNs before, during, and after training by pruning edges from the underlying topology. The resulting neural network is known as a sparse neural network. More recent work has demonstrated the remarkable result that certain sparse DNNs can train to the same precision as dense DNNs at lower runtime and storage cost. An intriguing class of these sparse DNNs is the X-Nets, which are initialized and trained upon a sparse topology with neither reference to a parent dense DNN nor subsequent pruning. We present an algorithm that deterministically generates sparse DNN topologies that, as a whole, are much more diverse than X-Net topologies, while preserving X-Nets' desired characteristics.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244817","feedforward neural networks;sparse matrices;artificial intelligence","Training;Runtime;Network topology;Hardware;Topology;Feedforward neural networks;Sparse matrices","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;topology","neural network topologies;sparse training;deep neural networks;underlying topology;resulting neural network;sparse neural network;dense DNNs;lower runtime;storage cost;sparse DNN topologies;X-Net topologies","","2","","18","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our project focuses on addressing shoulder injuries, including dislocations, sprains, and strains, which make up about 20% of all sports injuries. Shoulder injuries are prevalent in sports that require overhead movement like soccer, baseball, and volleyball [8]. Most shoulder injuries occur when the soft tissue begins to break down but the different types can vary. This includes: dislocation, separation, frozen shoulder, rotator cuff disease, torn rotator cuff, fracture, and arthritis [2]. In addition, individuals who have a history of shoulder injury are more prone to sustain multiple injuries. The proposed design for a Smart Shoulder Sling (SSS) aims to aid in the healing process of shoulder injuries, including sprains, strains, and fractures. After a physician examination, individuals must take the proper actions to ensure a healthy recovery and to prevent chronic pain and instability. The common acronym R.I.C.E works well for treatment of shoulder injuries. R.I.C.E stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. The proposed design assists in the ice, compression, and support aspects of the treatment by integrating a thermoelectric cooler unit and massaging unit into a shoulder sling to allow for comfort and stability.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244799","shoulder;injuries;sling;rotator cuff;ball and socket","","bone;diseases;gait analysis;injuries;medical computing;muscle;patient treatment;sport","shoulder injury;sports injuries;app-controlled brace;rotator cuff disease;torn rotator cuff;frozen shoulder;arthritis;Smart Shoulder Sling","","","","8","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People's lifestyles consist of a variety of activities which would involve stretching and tearing of the three outer ligaments of the foot. Almost 2.15 per 1000 persons, in the general population, per year will experience some form of ankle joint sprain or injury. Although in many cases the patients go on to heal without long term consequences, some may go on to develop chronic ankle instability overtime. As the ankle heals, different braces are introduced to the patient. The constant stiffness that passive braces impose on the patient can negatively affect the gait cycle and the overall motion of the ankle joint over time. Ankle joint instability is a debilitating condition incorporating recurrent sprains, persistent pain and repeated instances of giving way. Wearable ankle braces or assistive devices are intended to provide stability to the injured joint and help the user to get back to the normal lifestyle while the joint is healing and recovering its normal function. Although such devices have been shown to be useful, many limitations interfere with user's lifestyle by preventing them to pursue occupational or normal day activities due to joint impairment. Lengthy recovery time due to lack of the joint's natural activity is an example of such limitation. Controlled and limited exercise and mobility is important during recovery to improve the function in the nerves in the joint, increase stability, and decrease the patient's recovery time. This paper discusses a dynamic wearable smart brace developed and designed to improve the function and preserve the anatomical range of motion of the ankle joint in adults who suffer from ankle joint injury or instability. This paper illustrates the design of the DynoBrace, a smart, adaptive and dynamic brace that uses Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology integrated with the help of a user-friendly mobile device application. The design of the interface is proposed to be a printed circuit board (PCB) of a relatively small size that attaches to the brace. This PCB will be connected to the sensors through wires and will connect to the smart devices wirelessly via Bluetooth. User defined comfort and range of motion is of paramount importance for this smart adaptive brace.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244784","Wentworth Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244784","wearable;MEMS;ankle;adaptive","","Bluetooth;diseases;gait analysis;injuries;medical control systems;micromechanical devices;muscle;neurophysiology;orthotics;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment","joint impairment;joint increase stability;dynamic wearable smart brace;ankle joint injury;dynamic brace;user-friendly mobile device application;smart adaptive brace;stability control;smart brace device;ankle joint sprain;chronic ankle instability overtime;ankle heals;ankle joint instability;wearable ankle braces;injured joint;occupational day activities","","","","3","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the course of this research, three 50g glasses of differing chemical compositions were designed, synthesized, and tested. These glasses represent simplified versions of compositions used for nuclear waste immobilization, two of which had added concentrations of molybdenum oxide. Results from tests for density, phase change temperature, and crystallinity were analyzed and compared to classify the structure and resultant properties of each composition. The compositions containing molybdenum oxide were closely analyzed to determine the effect of this compound on the glass structure. It was concluded that molybdenum(VI) oxide likely causes a glass composition's constituent compounds to arrange themselves heterogeneously, weakening the structure.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244815","","Radioactive pollution;X-ray scattering;Glass;X-ray diffraction;Compounds;Molybdenum;Chemicals","chemical analysis;durability;glass structure;molybdenum compounds;oxidation;radioactive waste","nuclear waste glasses;chemical composition;nuclear waste immobilization;molybdenum oxide;glass structure;glass composition","","","","5","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polyester plastic that is used in additive manufacturing. In this study, we used two PLA additives, 30K PLA and 16K PLA, to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. In particular, we show that these PLA additives unanimously increase the PCE of perovskite solar cells across various concentrations and molecular weights. Additionally, because perovskite crystal size is positively correlated with cell efficiency, we developed a machine learning algorithm to autonomously compute size distributions of PLA-modified perovskite crystals from SEM images. This procedure showed that both the 30K and 16K PLA increased the average size of the crystal grains (p<; 0.05). The reason for the increased performance and crystal size are that the PLA forms complexes with excess PbI2, with PLA at the core and a PbI2 surrounding. These complexes passivate the boundaries between crystal grains, decreasing the number of trapped or dissoluted excitons and redirecting them in the direction of the current. The complexes likely also decrease the interfacial tension between crystal grains, resulting in crystal sizes which are up to 226% larger. By varying only concentration or only molecular weight, we discovered that there existed an optimal concentration and an optimal molecular weight of around 0.3 mg/mL and 16,000 amu respectively. We identified competing factors that would yield this trend: the aforementioned positive effects of the PLA, and the negative effects of nonideality of the JV curve (and consequences) and poorer conductivity. Given the observed improvement in efficiency of up to 17.5%, these results demonstrate that PLA additives are a novel and promising method of improving the performance of perovskite solar cells.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244813","","Additives;Machine learning algorithms;Excitons;Photovoltaic cells;Programmable logic arrays;Crystals;Market research","biodegradable materials;learning (artificial intelligence);materials science computing;passivation;plastics;power engineering computing;scanning electron microscopy;solar cells","perovskite solar cell efficiency;PLA additive induced boundary passivation;crystal image;additive manufacturing;PLA additives;perovskite crystal size;PLA-modified perovskite crystals;crystal grains;PLA forms complexes;temperature 30.0 K;temperature 16.0 K;PbI2","","","","8","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, we propose techniques to support high-fidelity rule mining of interesting drug combinations from safety reports by developing drug name matching, reaction name standardization, and known-rule matching strategies. For evaluation, we design a sensibility metric for drug name matching. We demonstrate that our technique achieves a sensibility score of 0.855, corresponding to a 91% accuracy. We compare methods for reaction name standardization and their effects on known-rule matching, identifying 427 known rules from 4652 generated signals when using our techniques as opposed to 61 known rules from 3276 generated signals without the application of our techniques.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244814","Drug-Drug Interactions;Adverse Drug Reactions;Data Mining;Data Preparation;Edit Distance","Drugs;Measurement;Surveillance;Standardization;Medical services;Safety;Signal detection","data mining;drug delivery systems;drugs;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;medical signal detection;patient treatment;pattern matching","post-marketing surveillance;known-rule matching strategies;reaction name standardization;drug name matching;interesting drug combinations;high-fidelity rule mining;harmful reactions;FDA;drug combination;adverse reactions;drug safety reports;drug-drug interaction signal detection","","","","19","IEEE","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This was accomplished through the development of a temperature/humidity sensor, door motion sensor, light sensor, and color sensor. These sensors were chosen to monitor the characteristics of a hypothetical house, so a program could give suggestions for conserving energy. The house monitoring system was built out of Arduino microcontrollers and a Java graphical user interface (GUI). The values taken from these sensors are compiled in a central computing source which adjusts air conditioning (AC) or sends alerts to the user based on the data collected around the home.

The engineering goal is to solve the problem of limited healthcare access with a single device. Diagnosing diseases automatically is an immense challenge, owing to their variable properties and symptoms. On the other hand, Neural Networks have developed into a powerful tool in the field of machine learning, one that is showing to be extremely promising at computing diagnosis even with inconsistent variables. In this research, a cheap device (under $30) was created to allow for straightforward diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. By utilizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), outfitted on a Raspberry Pi Zero processor ($5), the device is able to detect up to 1537 different diseases and conditions and utilize a CNN for on-device visual diagnostics. The user can input the symptoms using the buttons on the device and can take pictures using the same mechanism. The algorithm processes inputted symptoms, providing diagnosis and possible treatment options for common conditions. The purpose of this work was to be able to diagnose diseases through an affordable processor with high accuracy, as it is currently achieving an accuracy of 90% (±0.8%) for Top-5 symptom-based diagnoses, and 91% (±0.2%) for visual skin diseases. The NNs achieve performance far above any other tested system (WebMD, MEDoctor, so forth.), and its efficiency and ease of use will prove it to be a helpful tool for people around the world.

We review the literature and identify a rich variety of strategies along the machine learning pipeline for handling missing values, including forward imputation, appending additional missing indicators, and others. We also study different deep learning methods for handling time series data, namely GRU and LSTM cells. We then design an experimental study for investigating the relative effectiveness of different state-of-the-art methods for handling missing values to more fully comprehend the intricacies of missing data.

In particular, our experimental study compares variety of missingness-aware machine learning methods for predicting patient mortality, a benchmark task for this database.

Mechanical, structural, and thermal properties of each composite blend were tested to characterize the samples. Flexural tests were performed to measure the amount of load the composites could withstand. Impact data revealed that the mid-level blends absorbed the least amount of energy, reflecting a low impact resistance. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that with an increase in polystyrene content, the melting and crystallization temperatures remained constant.

This type of robot navigation behavior is generally referred to as leader-follower, and when the leader is a person instead of a vehicle, it is more specifically called ""human-leader, robot-follower"" (HLRF). Existing approaches to HLRF tend to be overly complex to implement. Computer vision offers a cost-effective solution; however, it can be problematic to rely solely on computer vision when multiple leader signatures of similar qualities are detected or when the leader signature is temporarily lost. This paper investigates the effect of fusing inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from the leader's cell phone with the robot's image data to improve the robustness of HLRF. We found that the addition of IMU data from the leader's mobile phone improved the reliability of the robot's following behavior, as well as the fuzzy controller's response in terms of settling time by up to 2.49 seconds.","","978-1-5386-9374-2","10.1109/URTC45901.2018.9244789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244789","fuzzy controller;IMU;computer vision;leader-follower","Computer vision;Measurement units;Educational robots;Navigation;Conferences;Mobile handsets;Robustness","fuzzy control;mobile computing;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;path planning;reliability;robot vision","robot navigation behavior;leader-follower;robot-follower;HLRF;computer vision;cost-effective solution;multiple leader signatures;leader signature;inertial measurement unit data;IMU data;mobile phone;robust robot;human leader;soldiers","","","","15","USGov","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, and increasingly, entrepreneurship courses have arisen in several universities and many of the courses in the management, administration and engineering areas already offer entrepreneurship curricular units. Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan. It is also relevant to mention the inclusion of “Chapter V – Prototype description” which is innovative and intends to take into account the application of this business plan template to the information technology sector.","","9788770220385","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226782.pdf&bkn=9218898&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"8 Artificial Cilia: Fabrication, Actuation, and Flow Generation","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","109","134","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people.

Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","217","280","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228285.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"About the Author","F. Riguzzi",NA,"Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming: Languages, Semantics, Inference and Learning","","2018","","","387","387","Probabilistic Logic Programming extends Logic Programming by enabling the representation of uncertain information by means of probability theory. Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods.

"About the Authors","A. Ibrahim; A. S. Alfa",NA; NA,"Optimization Methods for User Admissions and Radio Resource Allocation for Multicasting over High Altitude Platforms","","2018","","","133","134","This book focuses on the issue of optimizing radio resource allocation (RRA) and user admission control (AC) for multiple multicasting sessions on a single high altitude platform (HAP) with multiple antennas on-board. HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Overview on High Altitude Platforms, their different types and the recent works in this area • Radio Resource Allocation and User Admission Control in HAPs • Multicasting in a Single HAP System: System Model and Mathematical Formulation • Optimization schemes that are designed to enhance the performance of a branch and bound technique by taking into account special mathematical structure in the problem formulation","","9788770220354","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226811.pdf&bkn=9218843&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228372.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"5 Exploring IUCN's Failings – Members Perspective","M. P. Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","85","99","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226751.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

MEMS Silicon Oscillating Accelerometers and Readout Circuits consists of six chapters and covers both MEMS sensor and readout circuit, and provides an in-depth coverage on the design and modelling of the MEMS SOA with several recently reported prototypes. The book is not only useful to researchers and engineers who are familiar with the topic, but also appeals to those who have general interests in MEMS inertial sensors. The book includes extensive references that provide further information on this topic.","","9788770220446","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226935.pdf&bkn=9218867&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Tunnel FET (TFET) devices have been explored mostly in digital circuits, showing promising results for ultra-low power and energy efficient circuit applications. The TFET presents a low inverse sub-threshold slope (SS) that allows a low leakage energy consumption, desirable in many digital circuits, especially memories. In this book, the TFET is explored as an alternative technology also for ultra-low power and voltage conversion and management circuits, suitable for weak energy harvesting (EH) sources. The TFET distinct electrical characteristics under reverse bias conditions require changes in conventional circuit topologies. In this book, ultra-low input power conversion circuits based on TFETs are designed and analyzed, evaluating their performance as rectifiers, charge pumps and power management circuits (PMC) for RF and DC EH sources.","","9788793609754","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228359.pdf&bkn=9218869&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"About the Author","E. Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","113","114","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results. The final part of the book presents the design of a quantitative association rule mining algorithm. Quantitative association rules refer to a special type of association rules of the form that antecedent implies consequent consisting of a set of numerical or quantitative attributes. The introduced mining algorithm processes a specific number of user histories in order to generate a set of association rules with a minimally required support and confidence value. The generated rules show strong relationships that exist between the consequent and the antecedent of each rule, representing different items that have been consumed at specific price levels. This research book will be of appeal to researchers, graduate students, professionals, engineers and computer programmers.","","9788793609631","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228356.pdf&bkn=9218802&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Although rain water collection is relatively simple, the supply is often erratic. Passive fog water collection has been used in several parts of the world but is only relevant to certain geographical locations. Dew occurrence, however, is far more widespread, can form in most climates and geographic settings, show high frequency and prevalence throughout the year. During the past 20 years, dew collection has therefore been investigated as a serious supplemental source of fresh water. Dew Water offers a thorough review of dew, its formation characteristics and potential for dew collection, for audiences that include policy-makers, non-governmental organizations involved in development aid and sustainable development, engineers, urban planners, researchers and students. After providing a background on atmospheric water, humid air, and sky and materials emissivity, the book deals with dew formation and its estimation with a focus on the use of meteorological data. Dew measurement techniques are reviewed and discussed as well as dew collection by passive means. Computational fluid dynamics technique is described for better design of dew collectors. Dew quality (chemistry, biology) is assessed in view of potable water quality.

"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","i","xxx","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226813.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","401","432","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC. The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc. In so doing, the authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format.

"Glossary","",,"Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications","","2018","","","129","139","Internet of Things (IoT) security deals with safeguarding the devices and communications of IoT systems, by implementing protective measures and avoiding procedures which can lead to intrusions and attacks. However, security was never the prime focus during the development of the IoT, hence vendors have sold IoT solutions without thorough preventive measures. The idea of incorporating networking appliances in IoT systems is relatively new, and hence IoT security has not always been considered in the product design. To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet should be segmented into its own network, and have general network access restricted. The network segment should be monitored to identify potential anomalous traffic, and action should be taken if a problem arises. This has generated an altogether new area of research, which seeks possible solutions for securing the devices, and communication amongst them. Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications provides a comprehensive overview of the overall scenario of IoT Security whilst highlighting recent research and applications in the field.

Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","1","16","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC. The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc. In so doing, the authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format. Drawings and CNC programs to practice on are also included for the reader.","","9788770220422","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226845.pdf&bkn=9218772&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In the first part of the book, a preliminary overview of the effects of radiation in space, with a specific focus on memories, will be conducted to enable the reader to understand why specific design solutions are adopted to mitigate hard and soft errors. The second part will be devoted to RHBD (Radiation Hardening by Design) techniques for semiconductor components with a specific focus on memories. The approach will follow a top-down scheme starting from RHBD at architectural level (how to build a rad-hard floor-plan), at circuit level (how to mitigate radiation effects by handling transistors in the proper way) and at layout level (how to shape a layout to mitigate radiation effects). After the description of the mitigation techniques, the book enters in the core of the topic covering SRAMs (synchronous, asynchronous, single port and dual port) and PROMs (based on AntiFuse OTP technologies), describing how to design a rad-hard flash memory and fostering RHBD toward emerging memories like ReRAM. The last part will be a leap into emerging memories at a very early stage, not yet ready for industrial use in silicon but candidates to become an option for the next wave of rad-hard components.

Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","117","126","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228376.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226937.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"18 From Theory to Practice: Computer-aided Set Point Application","S. L. Goede; M. K. -S. Leow",NA; NA,"Thyroid Systems Engineering: A Primer in Mathematical Modeling of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis","","2018","","","279","288","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the behavioral modeling, evaluation and prediction of the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid system. Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228412.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In the first part of the book, a preliminary overview of the effects of radiation in space, with a specific focus on memories, will be conducted to enable the reader to understand why specific design solutions are adopted to mitigate hard and soft errors. The second part will be devoted to RHBD (Radiation Hardening by Design) techniques for semiconductor components with a specific focus on memories. The approach will follow a top-down scheme starting from RHBD at architectural level (how to build a rad-hard floor-plan), at circuit level (how to mitigate radiation effects by handling transistors in the proper way) and at layout level (how to shape a layout to mitigate radiation effects). After the description of the mitigation techniques, the book enters in the core of the topic covering SRAMs (synchronous, asynchronous, single port and dual port) and PROMs (based on AntiFuse OTP technologies), describing how to design a rad-hard flash memory and fostering RHBD toward emerging memories like ReRAM. The last part will be a leap into emerging memories at a very early stage, not yet ready for industrial use in silicon but candidates to become an option for the next wave of rad-hard components.

"1 Beyond High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","H. O. Domínguez; K. R. Rao",NA; NA,"Versatile Video Coding: Latest Advances in Video Coding Standards","","2018","","","3","18","Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 per cent of consumer Internet traffic. Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360° Video. The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020. This book presents the new VVC, and updates on the HEVC. The book discusses the advances in lossless coding and covers the topic of screen content coding. Technical topics discussed include: • Beyond the High Efficiency Video Coding • High Efficiency Video Coding encoder • Screen content • Lossless and visually lossless coding algorithms • Fast coding algorithms • Visual quality assessment • Other screen content coding algorithms Overview of JPEG Series","","9788770220460","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226920.pdf&bkn=9218840&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"10 Modeling Gel-based Artificial Cilia","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","149","182","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226849.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226686.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Basics of digital and flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip • Comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithms • Sample-preparation algorithms for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip • Sample-preparation algorithms for flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip","","9788770220545","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226969.pdf&bkn=9218912&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In the first part of the book, a preliminary overview of the effects of radiation in space, with a specific focus on memories, will be conducted to enable the reader to understand why specific design solutions are adopted to mitigate hard and soft errors. The second part will be devoted to RHBD (Radiation Hardening by Design) techniques for semiconductor components with a specific focus on memories. The approach will follow a top-down scheme starting from RHBD at architectural level (how to build a rad-hard floor-plan), at circuit level (how to mitigate radiation effects by handling transistors in the proper way) and at layout level (how to shape a layout to mitigate radiation effects). After the description of the mitigation techniques, the book enters in the core of the topic covering SRAMs (synchronous, asynchronous, single port and dual port) and PROMs (based on AntiFuse OTP technologies), describing how to design a rad-hard flash memory and fostering RHBD toward emerging memories like ReRAM. The last part will be a leap into emerging memories at a very early stage, not yet ready for industrial use in silicon but candidates to become an option for the next wave of rad-hard components.

Rao",NA; NA,"Versatile Video Coding: Latest Advances in Video Coding Standards","","2018","","","425","428","Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 per cent of consumer Internet traffic. Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360° Video. The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020. This book presents the new VVC, and updates on the HEVC. The book discusses the advances in lossless coding and covers the topic of screen content coding. Technical topics discussed include: • Beyond the High Efficiency Video Coding • High Efficiency Video Coding encoder • Screen content • Lossless and visually lossless coding algorithms • Fast coding algorithms • Visual quality assessment • Other screen content coding algorithms Overview of JPEG Series","","9788770220460","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226933.pdf&bkn=9218840&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Basics of digital and flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip • Comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithms • Sample-preparation algorithms for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip • Sample-preparation algorithms for flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip","","9788770220545","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227031.pdf&bkn=9218912&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Although rain water collection is relatively simple, the supply is often erratic. Passive fog water collection has been used in several parts of the world but is only relevant to certain geographical locations. Dew occurrence, however, is far more widespread, can form in most climates and geographic settings, show high frequency and prevalence throughout the year. During the past 20 years, dew collection has therefore been investigated as a serious supplemental source of fresh water. Dew Water offers a thorough review of dew, its formation characteristics and potential for dew collection, for audiences that include policy-makers, non-governmental organizations involved in development aid and sustainable development, engineers, urban planners, researchers and students. After providing a background on atmospheric water, humid air, and sky and materials emissivity, the book deals with dew formation and its estimation with a focus on the use of meteorological data. Dew measurement techniques are reviewed and discussed as well as dew collection by passive means. Computational fluid dynamics technique is described for better design of dew collectors. Dew quality (chemistry, biology) is assessed in view of potable water quality. Costs and economic aspects are also considered.","","9788793609464","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228377.pdf&bkn=9218791&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"3 Programming Ciliary Object Manipulation","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","36","48","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226796.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The last mile/meters of delivery of all e-services is now required to be wireless. It has always been known that wireless links are the bottleneck to providing high data rates and high quality of service. Several wireless signalling and performance analysis techniques to overcome the hurdles of wireless channels have been developed over the last decade, and these are fuelling the evolution of 4G towards 5G.

"2 Academic Search Algorithms","E. Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","17","52","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results. The final part of the book presents the design of a quantitative association rule mining algorithm. Quantitative association rules refer to a special type of association rules of the form that antecedent implies consequent consisting of a set of numerical or quantitative attributes. The introduced mining algorithm processes a specific number of user histories in order to generate a set of association rules with a minimally required support and confidence value. The generated rules show strong relationships that exist between the consequent and the antecedent of each rule, representing different items that have been consumed at specific price levels. This research book will be of appeal to researchers, graduate students, professionals, engineers and computer programmers.","","9788793609631","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228389.pdf&bkn=9218802&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"References","K. Pahlavan",NA,"Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology At the Emergence of Smart World and IoT","","2018","","","449","464","Precise and accurate localization is one of the fundamental scientific and engineering technologies needed for the applications enabling the emergence of the Smart World and the Internet of Things (IoT). Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226932.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","61","108","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228303.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"1 Introduction","M. P. Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","1","12","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226711.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Elayyan",NA; NA,"Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence in Higher Education","","2018","","","277","350","Quality Assurance is not a new concept in the education sector in general, and higher education in particular, though it is becoming increasingly more relevant and important. Higher education helps to improve an individual's quality of life by enabling them to inflate their knowledge and expertise, to grasp abstract concepts and theories, and to raise their awareness of the world and their community, and as such the assurance of quality is becoming more pivotal in the whole education process. There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education. The model integrates four main facets: the Educational System, Quality Assurance Managing and Control, Strategic Planning and Globalization. Also presented are international “best-practices” in quality assurance in higher education, from Japan and Finland.","","9788793609549","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228291.pdf&bkn=9218907&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"10 Sensor Fusion for Hybrid Localization","K. Pahlavan",NA,"Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology At the Emergence of Smart World and IoT","","2018","","","365","418","Precise and accurate localization is one of the fundamental scientific and engineering technologies needed for the applications enabling the emergence of the Smart World and the Internet of Things (IoT). Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226945.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"7 Magnetic Thin-film Cilia for Microfluidic Applications","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","85","108","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226855.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Although rain water collection is relatively simple, the supply is often erratic. Passive fog water collection has been used in several parts of the world but is only relevant to certain geographical locations. Dew occurrence, however, is far more widespread, can form in most climates and geographic settings, show high frequency and prevalence throughout the year. During the past 20 years, dew collection has therefore been investigated as a serious supplemental source of fresh water. Dew Water offers a thorough review of dew, its formation characteristics and potential for dew collection, for audiences that include policy-makers, non-governmental organizations involved in development aid and sustainable development, engineers, urban planners, researchers and students. After providing a background on atmospheric water, humid air, and sky and materials emissivity, the book deals with dew formation and its estimation with a focus on the use of meteorological data. Dew measurement techniques are reviewed and discussed as well as dew collection by passive means. Computational fluid dynamics technique is described for better design of dew collectors. Dew quality (chemistry, biology) is assessed in view of potable water quality. Costs and economic aspects are also considered.","","9788793609464","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228246.pdf&bkn=9218791&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"2 Radio Resource Allocation and User Admission Control in HAPs","A. Ibrahim; A. S. Alfa",NA; NA,"Optimization Methods for User Admissions and Radio Resource Allocation for Multicasting over High Altitude Platforms","","2018","","","9","24","This book focuses on the issue of optimizing radio resource allocation (RRA) and user admission control (AC) for multiple multicasting sessions on a single high altitude platform (HAP) with multiple antennas on-board. HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Overview on High Altitude Platforms, their different types and the recent works in this area • Radio Resource Allocation and User Admission Control in HAPs • Multicasting in a Single HAP System: System Model and Mathematical Formulation • Optimization schemes that are designed to enhance the performance of a branch and bound technique by taking into account special mathematical structure in the problem formulation","","9788770220354","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226859.pdf&bkn=9218843&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"9 Numerical Simulations of Fluid Transport by Magnetically Actuated Artificial Cilia","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","135","148","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226853.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"6 A Hierarchical Dataflow Architecture for Large-Scale Multi-FPGA Biophysically Accurate Neuron Simulation","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","143","162","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies. All parts of the system are generated automatically based on the neuron interconnection scheme in use. The simulator allows exploration of different system configurations, e.g. the interconnection scheme between the neurons, the intracellular concentration of different chemical compounds (ions), which affect how action potentials are initiated and propagate.","","9788770220330","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226873.pdf&bkn=9218606&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"8 Immunity and Antibodies","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","127","142","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228244.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"10 Conclusion","M. P. Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","233","252","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226717.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Leow",NA; NA,"Thyroid Systems Engineering: A Primer in Mathematical Modeling of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis","","2018","","","293","298","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the behavioral modeling, evaluation and prediction of the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid system. Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228378.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips.

In the first part of the book, a preliminary overview of the effects of radiation in space, with a specific focus on memories, will be conducted to enable the reader to understand why specific design solutions are adopted to mitigate hard and soft errors. The second part will be devoted to RHBD (Radiation Hardening by Design) techniques for semiconductor components with a specific focus on memories. The approach will follow a top-down scheme starting from RHBD at architectural level (how to build a rad-hard floor-plan), at circuit level (how to mitigate radiation effects by handling transistors in the proper way) and at layout level (how to shape a layout to mitigate radiation effects). After the description of the mitigation techniques, the book enters in the core of the topic covering SRAMs (synchronous, asynchronous, single port and dual port) and PROMs (based on AntiFuse OTP technologies), describing how to design a rad-hard flash memory and fostering RHBD toward emerging memories like ReRAM.

Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan.

"3 Screen Content Coding for HEVC","H. O. Domínguez; K. R. Rao",NA; NA,"Versatile Video Coding: Latest Advances in Video Coding Standards","","2018","","","139","152","Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 per cent of consumer Internet traffic. Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360° Video. The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020. This book presents the new VVC, and updates on the HEVC. The book discusses the advances in lossless coding and covers the topic of screen content coding. Technical topics discussed include: • Beyond the High Efficiency Video Coding • High Efficiency Video Coding encoder • Screen content • Lossless and visually lossless coding algorithms • Fast coding algorithms • Visual quality assessment • Other screen content coding algorithms Overview of JPEG Series","","9788770220460","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226921.pdf&bkn=9218840&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"1 Concept of Higher Education, Quality Assurance, and E-learning","A. O. A. Jaber; H. O. Elayyan",NA; NA,"Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence in Higher Education","","2018","","","1","38","Quality Assurance is not a new concept in the education sector in general, and higher education in particular, though it is becoming increasingly more relevant and important. Higher education helps to improve an individual's quality of life by enabling them to inflate their knowledge and expertise, to grasp abstract concepts and theories, and to raise their awareness of the world and their community, and as such the assurance of quality is becoming more pivotal in the whole education process. There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education. The model integrates four main facets: the Educational System, Quality Assurance Managing and Control, Strategic Planning and Globalization. Also presented are international “best-practices” in quality assurance in higher education, from Japan and Finland.","","9788793609549","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228262.pdf&bkn=9218907&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"11 Extrapolation to the Set Point from a Single Available Measurement","S. L. Goede; M. K. -S. Leow",NA; NA,"Thyroid Systems Engineering: A Primer in Mathematical Modeling of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis","","2018","","","145","156","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the behavioral modeling, evaluation and prediction of the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid system. Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228411.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Pahlavan",NA,"Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology At the Emergence of Smart World and IoT","","2018","","","465","470","Precise and accurate localization is one of the fundamental scientific and engineering technologies needed for the applications enabling the emergence of the Smart World and the Internet of Things (IoT). Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226907.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","73","128","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC. The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc. In so doing, the authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format.

"3 Operational Plan","F. Almeida; J. D. Santos",NA; NA,"The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses","","2018","","","99","114","There is a great worldwide desire to launch new technology-based business. In this sense, and increasingly, entrepreneurship courses have arisen in several universities and many of the courses in the management, administration and engineering areas already offer entrepreneurship curricular units. Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan. It is also relevant to mention the inclusion of “Chapter V – Prototype description” which is innovative and intends to take into account the application of this business plan template to the information technology sector.","","9788770220385","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226829.pdf&bkn=9218898&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Tunnel FET (TFET) devices have been explored mostly in digital circuits, showing promising results for ultra-low power and energy efficient circuit applications. The TFET presents a low inverse sub-threshold slope (SS) that allows a low leakage energy consumption, desirable in many digital circuits, especially memories. In this book, the TFET is explored as an alternative technology also for ultra-low power and voltage conversion and management circuits, suitable for weak energy harvesting (EH) sources. The TFET distinct electrical characteristics under reverse bias conditions require changes in conventional circuit topologies.

"5 Exact Inference","F. Riguzzi",NA,"Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming: Languages, Semantics, Inference and Learning","","2018","","","145","194","Probabilistic Logic Programming extends Logic Programming by enabling the representation of uncertain information by means of probability theory. Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods. Many examples of the book include a link to a page of the web application http://cplint.eu where the code can be run online.","","9788770220170","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226709.pdf&bkn=9218850&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"1","E. Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","1","16","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results. The final part of the book presents the design of a quantitative association rule mining algorithm. Quantitative association rules refer to a special type of association rules of the form that antecedent implies consequent consisting of a set of numerical or quantitative attributes. The introduced mining algorithm processes a specific number of user histories in order to generate a set of association rules with a minimally required support and confidence value. The generated rules show strong relationships that exist between the consequent and the antecedent of each rule, representing different items that have been consumed at specific price levels. This research book will be of appeal to researchers, graduate students, professionals, engineers and computer programmers.","","9788793609631","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228350.pdf&bkn=9218802&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","467","468","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology.

Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body.

"4 Robotic Cilia for Autonomous Parallel Distributed Sorting Platforms","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","49","60","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226784.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"9 The Human Hypothalamus–Pituitary–Thyroid Control System","S. L. Goede; M. K. -S. Leow",NA; NA,"Thyroid Systems Engineering: A Primer in Mathematical Modeling of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis","","2018","","","111","134","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the behavioral modeling, evaluation and prediction of the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid system. Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228320.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"5 Dimension Methods, Machine Zero, Work Zero and Machine Axis","P. Kumar Negi; M. Ram; O. P. Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","45","54","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC. The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc. In so doing, the authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format.

Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360° Video. The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020. This book presents the new VVC, and updates on the HEVC. The book discusses the advances in lossless coding and covers the topic of screen content coding. Technical topics discussed include: • Beyond the High Efficiency Video Coding • High Efficiency Video Coding encoder • Screen content • Lossless and visually lossless coding algorithms • Fast coding algorithms • Visual quality assessment • Other screen content coding algorithms Overview of JPEG Series","","9788770220460","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226941.pdf&bkn=9218840&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"About the Authors","A. Ibrahim; A. S. Alfa",NA; NA,"Optimization Methods for User Admissions and Radio Resource Allocation for Multicasting over High Altitude Platforms","","2018","","","133","134","This book focuses on the issue of optimizing radio resource allocation (RRA) and user admission control (AC) for multiple multicasting sessions on a single high altitude platform (HAP) with multiple antennas on-board. HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Overview on High Altitude Platforms, their different types and the recent works in this area • Radio Resource Allocation and User Admission Control in HAPs • Multicasting in a Single HAP System: System Model and Mathematical Formulation • Optimization schemes that are designed to enhance the performance of a branch and bound technique by taking into account special mathematical structure in the problem formulation","","9788770220354","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226876.pdf&bkn=9218843&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226923.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"12 Conclusions","F. Riguzzi",NA,"Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming: Languages, Semantics, Inference and Learning","","2018","","","351","352","Probabilistic Logic Programming extends Logic Programming by enabling the representation of uncertain information by means of probability theory. Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods.

In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth.

Modulation Theory is intended to serve as a complementary textbook for courses dealing with Modulation Theory or Communication Systems, but also as a professional book, for engineers who need to update their knowledge in the communications area. The modulation aspects presented in the book use modern concepts of stochastic processes, such as autocorrelation and power spectrum density, which are novel for undergraduate texts or professional books, and provides a general approach for the theory, with real life results, applied to professional design. This text is suitable for the undergraduate as well as the initial graduate levels of Electrical Engineering courses, and is useful for the professional who wants to review or get acquainted with the a modern exposition of the modulation theory. The books covers signal representations for most known waveforms, Fourier analysis, and presents an introduction to Fourier transform and signal spectrum, including the concepts of convolution, autocorrelation and power spectral density, for deterministic signals. It introduces the concepts of probability, random variables and stochastic processes, including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, power spectral and cross-spectral densities, for random signals, and their applications to the analysis of linear systems. This chapter also includes the response of specific non-linear systems, such as power amplifiers. The book presents amplitude modulation with random signals, including analog and digital signals, and discusses performance evaluation methods, presents quadrature amplitude modulation using random signals. Several modulation schemes are discussed, including SSB, QAM, ISB, C-QUAM, QPSK and MSK. Their autocorrelation and power spectrum densities are computed. A thorough discussion on angle modulation with random modulating signals, along with frequency and phase modulation, and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is provided. Their power spectrum densities are computed using the Wiener-Khintchin theorem.","","9788793609358","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228270.pdf&bkn=9218890&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","13","25","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226749.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Basics of digital and flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip • Comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithms • Sample-preparation algorithms for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip • Sample-preparation algorithms for flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip","","9788770220545","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226954.pdf&bkn=9218912&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"About the Editors","",,"Rad-hard Semiconductor Memories","","2018","","","373","374","Rad-hard Semiconductor Memories is intended for researchers and professionals interested in understanding how to design and make a preliminary evaluation of rad-hard semiconductor memories, making leverage on standard CMOS manufacturing processes available from different silicon foundries and using different technology nodes. In the first part of the book, a preliminary overview of the effects of radiation in space, with a specific focus on memories, will be conducted to enable the reader to understand why specific design solutions are adopted to mitigate hard and soft errors. The second part will be devoted to RHBD (Radiation Hardening by Design) techniques for semiconductor components with a specific focus on memories. The approach will follow a top-down scheme starting from RHBD at architectural level (how to build a rad-hard floor-plan), at circuit level (how to mitigate radiation effects by handling transistors in the proper way) and at layout level (how to shape a layout to mitigate radiation effects). After the description of the mitigation techniques, the book enters in the core of the topic covering SRAMs (synchronous, asynchronous, single port and dual port) and PROMs (based on AntiFuse OTP technologies), describing how to design a rad-hard flash memory and fostering RHBD toward emerging memories like ReRAM. The last part will be a leap into emerging memories at a very early stage, not yet ready for industrial use in silicon but candidates to become an option for the next wave of rad-hard components. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Radiation effects on semiconductor components (TID, SEE) • Radiation Hardening by Design (RHBD) Techniques • Rad-hard SRAMs • Rad-hard PROMs • Rad-hard Flash NVMs • Rad-hard ReRAMs • Rad-hard emerging technologies","","9788770220194","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226767.pdf&bkn=9218811&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"6 Blinking-Vortex Inspired Mixing with Cilia","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","75","84","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226856.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"9 Serology","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","143","190","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228487.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"4 Digital Neuron Cells for Highly Parallel Cognitive Systems","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","81","110","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies. All parts of the system are generated automatically based on the neuron interconnection scheme in use. The simulator allows exploration of different system configurations, e.g. the interconnection scheme between the neurons, the intracellular concentration of different chemical compounds (ions), which affect how action potentials are initiated and propagate.","","9788770220330","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226815.pdf&bkn=9218606&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This superlative growth of data consumption has come about due to several reasons, such as evolution of the consumer devices, the types of telephone and smartphone being used, convergence of services, digitisation of economic transactions, tele-education, telemedicine, m-commerce, virtual reality office, social media, e-governance, e-security, to name but a few. Not only has the society transformed to a digital world, but also the expectations from the services provided have increased many folds. The last mile/meters of delivery of all e-services is now required to be wireless. It has always been known that wireless links are the bottleneck to providing high data rates and high quality of service. Several wireless signalling and performance analysis techniques to overcome the hurdles of wireless channels have been developed over the last decade, and these are fuelling the evolution of 4G towards 5G.

Leow",NA; NA,"Thyroid Systems Engineering: A Primer in Mathematical Modeling of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis","","2018","","","99","110","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the behavioral modeling, evaluation and prediction of the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid system. Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228276.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226934.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"8 Conclusion and Future Directions","S. Bhattacharjee; B. B. Bhattacharya; K. Chakrabarty",NA; NA; NA,"Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip","","2018","","","141","142","Recent microfluidic technologies have brought a complete paradigm shift in automating biochemical processing on a tiny lab-on-chip (a.k.a. biochip) that replaces expensive and bulky instruments traditionally used in implementing bench-top laboratory protocols. Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Basics of digital and flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip • Comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithms • Sample-preparation algorithms for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip • Sample-preparation algorithms for flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip","","9788770220545","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226991.pdf&bkn=9218912&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In this sense, and increasingly, entrepreneurship courses have arisen in several universities and many of the courses in the management, administration and engineering areas already offer entrepreneurship curricular units. Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan. It is also relevant to mention the inclusion of “Chapter V – Prototype description” which is innovative and intends to take into account the application of this business plan template to the information technology sector.","","9788770220385","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226779.pdf&bkn=9218898&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228414.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

However, security was never the prime focus during the development of the IoT, hence vendors have sold IoT solutions without thorough preventive measures. The idea of incorporating networking appliances in IoT systems is relatively new, and hence IoT security has not always been considered in the product design. To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet should be segmented into its own network, and have general network access restricted. The network segment should be monitored to identify potential anomalous traffic, and action should be taken if a problem arises. This has generated an altogether new area of research, which seeks possible solutions for securing the devices, and communication amongst them. Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications provides a comprehensive overview of the overall scenario of IoT Security whilst highlighting recent research and applications in the field.

Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","105","110","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results. The final part of the book presents the design of a quantitative association rule mining algorithm. Quantitative association rules refer to a special type of association rules of the form that antecedent implies consequent consisting of a set of numerical or quantitative attributes. The introduced mining algorithm processes a specific number of user histories in order to generate a set of association rules with a minimally required support and confidence value. The generated rules show strong relationships that exist between the consequent and the antecedent of each rule, representing different items that have been consumed at specific price levels. This research book will be of appeal to researchers, graduate students, professionals, engineers and computer programmers.","","9788793609631","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228240.pdf&bkn=9218802&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In the first part of the book, a preliminary overview of the effects of radiation in space, with a specific focus on memories, will be conducted to enable the reader to understand why specific design solutions are adopted to mitigate hard and soft errors. The second part will be devoted to RHBD (Radiation Hardening by Design) techniques for semiconductor components with a specific focus on memories. The approach will follow a top-down scheme starting from RHBD at architectural level (how to build a rad-hard floor-plan), at circuit level (how to mitigate radiation effects by handling transistors in the proper way) and at layout level (how to shape a layout to mitigate radiation effects). After the description of the mitigation techniques, the book enters in the core of the topic covering SRAMs (synchronous, asynchronous, single port and dual port) and PROMs (based on AntiFuse OTP technologies), describing how to design a rad-hard flash memory and fostering RHBD toward emerging memories like ReRAM.

Higher education helps to improve an individual's quality of life by enabling them to inflate their knowledge and expertise, to grasp abstract concepts and theories, and to raise their awareness of the world and their community, and as such the assurance of quality is becoming more pivotal in the whole education process. There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education. The model integrates four main facets: the Educational System, Quality Assurance Managing and Control, Strategic Planning and Globalization. Also presented are international “best-practices” in quality assurance in higher education, from Japan and Finland.","","9788793609549","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228332.pdf&bkn=9218907&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"9 Conclusion and Future Work","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","223","228","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies.

Tunnel FET (TFET) devices have been explored mostly in digital circuits, showing promising results for ultra-low power and energy efficient circuit applications. The TFET presents a low inverse sub-threshold slope (SS) that allows a low leakage energy consumption, desirable in many digital circuits, especially memories. In this book, the TFET is explored as an alternative technology also for ultra-low power and voltage conversion and management circuits, suitable for weak energy harvesting (EH) sources. The TFET distinct electrical characteristics under reverse bias conditions require changes in conventional circuit topologies.

"Index","A. Ibrahim; A. S. Alfa",NA; NA,"Optimization Methods for User Admissions and Radio Resource Allocation for Multicasting over High Altitude Platforms","","2018","","","129","132","This book focuses on the issue of optimizing radio resource allocation (RRA) and user admission control (AC) for multiple multicasting sessions on a single high altitude platform (HAP) with multiple antennas on-board. HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Overview on High Altitude Platforms, their different types and the recent works in this area • Radio Resource Allocation and User Admission Control in HAPs • Multicasting in a Single HAP System: System Model and Mathematical Formulation • Optimization schemes that are designed to enhance the performance of a branch and bound technique by taking into account special mathematical structure in the problem formulation","","9788770220354","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226880.pdf&bkn=9218843&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","309","332","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228232.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips.

Leow",NA; NA,"Thyroid Systems Engineering: A Primer in Mathematical Modeling of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis","","2018","","","233","254","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the behavioral modeling, evaluation and prediction of the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid system. Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228224.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"About the Authors","P. Kumar Negi; M. Ram; O. P. Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","437","440","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC. The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc. In so doing, the authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format. Drawings and CNC programs to practice on are also included for the reader.","","9788770220422","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226838.pdf&bkn=9218772&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"7 Single-Lead Neuromorphic ECG Classification System","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","163","188","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies. All parts of the system are generated automatically based on the neuron interconnection scheme in use. The simulator allows exploration of different system configurations, e.g. the interconnection scheme between the neurons, the intracellular concentration of different chemical compounds (ions), which affect how action potentials are initiated and propagate.","","9788770220330","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226773.pdf&bkn=9218606&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In the first part of the book, a preliminary overview of the effects of radiation in space, with a specific focus on memories, will be conducted to enable the reader to understand why specific design solutions are adopted to mitigate hard and soft errors. The second part will be devoted to RHBD (Radiation Hardening by Design) techniques for semiconductor components with a specific focus on memories. The approach will follow a top-down scheme starting from RHBD at architectural level (how to build a rad-hard floor-plan), at circuit level (how to mitigate radiation effects by handling transistors in the proper way) and at layout level (how to shape a layout to mitigate radiation effects). After the description of the mitigation techniques, the book enters in the core of the topic covering SRAMs (synchronous, asynchronous, single port and dual port) and PROMs (based on AntiFuse OTP technologies), describing how to design a rad-hard flash memory and fostering RHBD toward emerging memories like ReRAM. The last part will be a leap into emerging memories at a very early stage, not yet ready for industrial use in silicon but candidates to become an option for the next wave of rad-hard components.

"4 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Theory","M. S. De Alencar",NA,"Modulation Theory","","2018","","","121","142","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the design, performance analysis and evaluation of modulation schemes to be used in wireless and optical networks, towards the development of the next and future generations of mobile cellular communication systems. Modulation Theory is intended to serve as a complementary textbook for courses dealing with Modulation Theory or Communication Systems, but also as a professional book, for engineers who need to update their knowledge in the communications area. The modulation aspects presented in the book use modern concepts of stochastic processes, such as autocorrelation and power spectrum density, which are novel for undergraduate texts or professional books, and provides a general approach for the theory, with real life results, applied to professional design. This text is suitable for the undergraduate as well as the initial graduate levels of Electrical Engineering courses, and is useful for the professional who wants to review or get acquainted with the a modern exposition of the modulation theory. The books covers signal representations for most known waveforms, Fourier analysis, and presents an introduction to Fourier transform and signal spectrum, including the concepts of convolution, autocorrelation and power spectral density, for deterministic signals. It introduces the concepts of probability, random variables and stochastic processes, including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, power spectral and cross-spectral densities, for random signals, and their applications to the analysis of linear systems. This chapter also includes the response of specific non-linear systems, such as power amplifiers. The book presents amplitude modulation with random signals, including analog and digital signals, and discusses performance evaluation methods, presents quadrature amplitude modulation using random signals. Several modulation schemes are discussed, including SSB, QAM, ISB, C-QUAM, QPSK and MSK. Their autocorrelation and power spectrum densities are computed. A thorough discussion on angle modulation with random modulating signals, along with frequency and phase modulation, and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is provided. Their power spectrum densities are computed using the Wiener-Khintchin theorem.","","9788793609358","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228366.pdf&bkn=9218890&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","111","112","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results. The final part of the book presents the design of a quantitative association rule mining algorithm. Quantitative association rules refer to a special type of association rules of the form that antecedent implies consequent consisting of a set of numerical or quantitative attributes. The introduced mining algorithm processes a specific number of user histories in order to generate a set of association rules with a minimally required support and confidence value. The generated rules show strong relationships that exist between the consequent and the antecedent of each rule, representing different items that have been consumed at specific price levels. This research book will be of appeal to researchers, graduate students, professionals, engineers and computer programmers.","","9788793609631","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228222.pdf&bkn=9218802&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226936.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","433","436","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC. The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc. In so doing, the authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format. Drawings and CNC programs to practice on are also included for the reader.","","9788770220422","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226840.pdf&bkn=9218772&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"2 Genetic Engineering of Ciliated Cells","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","15","36","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2.

Tunnel FET (TFET) devices have been explored mostly in digital circuits, showing promising results for ultra-low power and energy efficient circuit applications. The TFET presents a low inverse sub-threshold slope (SS) that allows a low leakage energy consumption, desirable in many digital circuits, especially memories. In this book, the TFET is explored as an alternative technology also for ultra-low power and voltage conversion and management circuits, suitable for weak energy harvesting (EH) sources. The TFET distinct electrical characteristics under reverse bias conditions require changes in conventional circuit topologies. In this book, ultra-low input power conversion circuits based on TFETs are designed and analyzed, evaluating their performance as rectifiers, charge pumps and power management circuits (PMC) for RF and DC EH sources.","","9788793609754","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228333.pdf&bkn=9218869&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"Introduction","A. Bhattacharyya",NA,"Cybernetics in C++","","2018","","","1","6","C++ is a powerful, much sought after programming language, but can be daunting to work with, even for engineering professionals. Why is this book so useful? Have you ever wondered: • How do keywords like static and virtual change their meanings according to context? • What are the similarities and differences between Pointers and References, Pointers and Arrays, Constructors and Copy Constructors, Nested and Local Inner Classes? • Why is Multiple Interface Inheritance seen to be beautiful but Multiple Implementation Inheritance considered evil? • When is Polymorphism Static or Dynamic, Bounded or Unbounded? Answers on these questions, and much more, are explained in this book, Cybernetics in C++. What makes this text so different and appealing in comparison to existing books on the market? • The Bulleted style, as opposed to Prose, produces results much faster, both in learning and reference • Rules of Thumb, and further expert Tips are given throughout in how to optimise your code • The Prospective Evils sections tell you what to avoid • The thorough coverage ensures you will be trained to expert level in each of Imperative, Procedural, Memory & Resource Management, Object Oriented and Generic Programming Cybernetics in C++ combines a theoretical overview and practical approach in one book, which should prove to be a useful reference for computer scientists, software programmers, engineers and students in this and related field.","","9788793609440","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228353.pdf&bkn=9218808&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"1 Disruptive Innovation in Vital Embedded Systems and the Internet of Vital Things","",,"Dependable IoT for Human and Industry: Modeling, Architecting, Implementation","","2018","","","15","46","The subject of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is enormously complex, involving many concepts, probabilities, and signal processing that are woven together in an intricate manner. To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems. The textbook includes a wealth of problems, with solutions • Worked-out examples have been included to explain new and difficult concepts, which help to expose the reader to real-life signal processing problems • The inclusion of FIR and IIR filter design further enrich the contents","","9788770220132","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226753.pdf&bkn=9218775&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"9 Discussion of Theory, Knowledge Creation, and Diffusion at IUCN: National and International Programs","M. P. Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","203","232","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226748.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"4 Lossless and Visually Lossless Coding Algorithms","H. O. Domínguez; K. R. Rao",NA; NA,"Versatile Video Coding: Latest Advances in Video Coding Standards","","2018","","","153","180","Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 per cent of consumer Internet traffic. Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360° Video. The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020. This book presents the new VVC, and updates on the HEVC. The book discusses the advances in lossless coding and covers the topic of screen content coding. Technical topics discussed include: • Beyond the High Efficiency Video Coding • High Efficiency Video Coding encoder • Screen content • Lossless and visually lossless coding algorithms • Fast coding algorithms • Visual quality assessment • Other screen content coding algorithms Overview of JPEG Series","","9788770220460","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226911.pdf&bkn=9218840&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"9 Parameter Learning","F. Riguzzi",NA,"Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming: Languages, Semantics, Inference and Learning","","2018","","","259","282","Probabilistic Logic Programming extends Logic Programming by enabling the representation of uncertain information by means of probability theory. Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods.

"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","E. Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","i","xix","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000).

Tunnel FET (TFET) devices have been explored mostly in digital circuits, showing promising results for ultra-low power and energy efficient circuit applications. The TFET presents a low inverse sub-threshold slope (SS) that allows a low leakage energy consumption, desirable in many digital circuits, especially memories. In this book, the TFET is explored as an alternative technology also for ultra-low power and voltage conversion and management circuits, suitable for weak energy harvesting (EH) sources. The TFET distinct electrical characteristics under reverse bias conditions require changes in conventional circuit topologies. In this book, ultra-low input power conversion circuits based on TFETs are designed and analyzed, evaluating their performance as rectifiers, charge pumps and power management circuits (PMC) for RF and DC EH sources.","","9788793609754","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228258.pdf&bkn=9218869&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

However, security was never the prime focus during the development of the IoT, hence vendors have sold IoT solutions without thorough preventive measures. The idea of incorporating networking appliances in IoT systems is relatively new, and hence IoT security has not always been considered in the product design. To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet should be segmented into its own network, and have general network access restricted. The network segment should be monitored to identify potential anomalous traffic, and action should be taken if a problem arises. This has generated an altogether new area of research, which seeks possible solutions for securing the devices, and communication amongst them. Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications provides a comprehensive overview of the overall scenario of IoT Security whilst highlighting recent research and applications in the field.

"5 Artificial Pneumatic Cilia","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","61","74","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226894.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Rao",NA; NA,"Versatile Video Coding: Latest Advances in Video Coding Standards","","2018","","","i","xxx","Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 per cent of consumer Internet traffic. Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC).

Higher education helps to improve an individual's quality of life by enabling them to inflate their knowledge and expertise, to grasp abstract concepts and theories, and to raise their awareness of the world and their community, and as such the assurance of quality is becoming more pivotal in the whole education process. There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education. The model integrates four main facets: the Educational System, Quality Assurance Managing and Control, Strategic Planning and Globalization. Also presented are international “best-practices” in quality assurance in higher education, from Japan and Finland.","","9788793609549","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228349.pdf&bkn=9218907&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results.

"6 Conclusion and Future Work","A. Ibrahim; A. S. Alfa",NA; NA,"Optimization Methods for User Admissions and Radio Resource Allocation for Multicasting over High Altitude Platforms","","2018","","","115","118","This book focuses on the issue of optimizing radio resource allocation (RRA) and user admission control (AC) for multiple multicasting sessions on a single high altitude platform (HAP) with multiple antennas on-board. HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Overview on High Altitude Platforms, their different types and the recent works in this area • Radio Resource Allocation and User Admission Control in HAPs • Multicasting in a Single HAP System: System Model and Mathematical Formulation • Optimization schemes that are designed to enhance the performance of a branch and bound technique by taking into account special mathematical structure in the problem formulation","","9788770220354","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226893.pdf&bkn=9218843&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","i","xxxii","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies. All parts of the system are generated automatically based on the neuron interconnection scheme in use. The simulator allows exploration of different system configurations, e.g. the interconnection scheme between the neurons, the intracellular concentration of different chemical compounds (ions), which affect how action potentials are initiated and propagate.","","9788770220330","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226887.pdf&bkn=9218606&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Introduction","H. O. Domínguez; K. R. Rao",NA; NA,"Versatile Video Coding: Latest Advances in Video Coding Standards","","2018","","","1","2","Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 per cent of consumer Internet traffic. Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360° Video. The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020. This book presents the new VVC, and updates on the HEVC. The book discusses the advances in lossless coding and covers the topic of screen content coding. Technical topics discussed include: • Beyond the High Efficiency Video Coding • High Efficiency Video Coding encoder • Screen content • Lossless and visually lossless coding algorithms • Fast coding algorithms • Visual quality assessment • Other screen content coding algorithms Overview of JPEG Series","","9788770220460","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226926.pdf&bkn=9218840&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","309","312","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226726.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan.

"3 IoT Data Processing: The Different Archetypes and Their Security and Privacy Assessment","",,"Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications","","2018","","","37","54","Internet of Things (IoT) security deals with safeguarding the devices and communications of IoT systems, by implementing protective measures and avoiding procedures which can lead to intrusions and attacks. However, security was never the prime focus during the development of the IoT, hence vendors have sold IoT solutions without thorough preventive measures. The idea of incorporating networking appliances in IoT systems is relatively new, and hence IoT security has not always been considered in the product design. To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet should be segmented into its own network, and have general network access restricted. The network segment should be monitored to identify potential anomalous traffic, and action should be taken if a problem arises.

Pahlavan",NA,"Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology At the Emergence of Smart World and IoT","","2018","","","441","444","Precise and accurate localization is one of the fundamental scientific and engineering technologies needed for the applications enabling the emergence of the Smart World and the Internet of Things (IoT). Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226831.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Basics of digital and flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip • Comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithms • Sample-preparation algorithms for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip • Sample-preparation algorithms for flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip","","9788770220545","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227018.pdf&bkn=9218912&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"5 Energy-Efficient Multipath Ring Network for Heterogeneous Clustered Neuronal Arrays","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","111","142","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies. All parts of the system are generated automatically based on the neuron interconnection scheme in use. The simulator allows exploration of different system configurations, e.g. the interconnection scheme between the neurons, the intracellular concentration of different chemical compounds (ions), which affect how action potentials are initiated and propagate.","","9788770220330","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226862.pdf&bkn=9218606&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Leow",NA; NA,"Thyroid Systems Engineering: A Primer in Mathematical Modeling of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis","","2018","","","289","292","In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted, both in industry and academia, towards the behavioral modeling, evaluation and prediction of the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid system. Thyroid Systems Engineering targets an optimal treatment of people suffering from thyroid hormone disorders. The content is motivated by in-depth observations of such patients whose rich data supported the theoretical framework arising from formal mathematical reasoning, guided by the nature of thyroid physiology. Leveraging on the insights emerging from the unique combination of an electrical engineer working with a clinical thyroidologist, and both being scientists skilled in mathematics, the authors introduce this new discipline and field of scientific investigation aptly designated as Thyroid Systems Engineering. Readers will discover that mathematics can indeed model the behavior of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Focused on modeling, each of the eighteen chapters gives the reader a notion of the application of relevant mathematics to pertinent issues encountered in mainstream thyroidology. Many cellular processes resemble the flux of variables and states in a complex multi-parameter space through time analogous to current flow in electrical networks. It is then logical to apply the principles and physical laws of electrodynamics, electrical network theory, control systems theory and signal theory to many of the biological phenomena encountered in endocrinology. Such an approach is used liberally throughout the book and successfully yields elegant solutions to a number of models presented within. This book can serve as a reference to mathematical modeling in other aspects of endocrine physiology, and as the starting point for a fundamental course in medical modeling. It will appeal to postgraduates in electrical engineering, academic physicians and biomedical researchers. Further, readers equipped with advanced calculus, electrical network theory, control theory and signal theory should be able to follow the mathematical expositions that describe thyrotropic control. They represent a new discipline based on mathematical modeling in physiology applicable to medical diagnostics, measurement and treatment to cooperate in the clinical team and realize an optimized treatment for patients.","","9788793609587","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228395.pdf&bkn=9218800&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","55","60","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228317.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"4 Quantitative Association Rules Mining","E. Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","77","100","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results. The final part of the book presents the design of a quantitative association rule mining algorithm. Quantitative association rules refer to a special type of association rules of the form that antecedent implies consequent consisting of a set of numerical or quantitative attributes. The introduced mining algorithm processes a specific number of user histories in order to generate a set of association rules with a minimally required support and confidence value. The generated rules show strong relationships that exist between the consequent and the antecedent of each rule, representing different items that have been consumed at specific price levels. This research book will be of appeal to researchers, graduate students, professionals, engineers and computer programmers.","","9788793609631","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228357.pdf&bkn=9218802&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Chakrabarty",NA; NA; NA,"Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip","","2018","","","29","42","Recent microfluidic technologies have brought a complete paradigm shift in automating biochemical processing on a tiny lab-on-chip (a.k.a. biochip) that replaces expensive and bulky instruments traditionally used in implementing bench-top laboratory protocols. Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Basics of digital and flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip • Comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithms • Sample-preparation algorithms for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip • Sample-preparation algorithms for flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip","","9788770220545","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227014.pdf&bkn=9218912&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Although rain water collection is relatively simple, the supply is often erratic. Passive fog water collection has been used in several parts of the world but is only relevant to certain geographical locations. Dew occurrence, however, is far more widespread, can form in most climates and geographic settings, show high frequency and prevalence throughout the year. During the past 20 years, dew collection has therefore been investigated as a serious supplemental source of fresh water. Dew Water offers a thorough review of dew, its formation characteristics and potential for dew collection, for audiences that include policy-makers, non-governmental organizations involved in development aid and sustainable development, engineers, urban planners, researchers and students. After providing a background on atmospheric water, humid air, and sky and materials emissivity, the book deals with dew formation and its estimation with a focus on the use of meteorological data. Dew measurement techniques are reviewed and discussed as well as dew collection by passive means. Computational fluid dynamics technique is described for better design of dew collectors. Dew quality (chemistry, biology) is assessed in view of potable water quality. Costs and economic aspects are also considered.","","9788793609464","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228444.pdf&bkn=9218791&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems.

Amolochitis",NA,"Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining","","2018","","","53","76","Algorithms and Applications for Academic Search, Recommendation and Quantitative Association Rule Mining presents novel algorithms for academic search, recommendation and association rule mining that have been developed and optimized for different commercial as well as academic purpose systems. Along with the design and implementation of algorithms, a major part of the work presented in the book involves the development of new systems both for commercial as well as for academic use. In the first part of the book the author introduces a novel hierarchical heuristic scheme for re-ranking academic publications retrieved from standard digital libraries. The scheme is based on the hierarchical combination of a custom implementation of the term frequency heuristic, a time-depreciated citation score and a graph-theoretic computed score that relates the paper's index terms with each other. In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithms, a meta-search engine has been designed and developed that submits user queries to standard digital repositories of academic publications and re-ranks the top-n results using the introduced hierarchical heuristic scheme. In the second part of the book the design of novel recommendation algorithms with application in different types of e-commerce systems are described. The newly introduced algorithms are a part of a developed Movie Recommendation system, the first such system to be commercially deployed in Greece by a major Triple Play services provider. The initial version of the system uses a novel hybrid recommender (user, item and content based) and provides daily recommendations to all active subscribers of the provider (currently more than 30,000). The recommenders that we are presenting are hybrid by nature, using an ensemble configuration of different content, user as well as item-based recommenders in order to provide more accurate recommendation results. The final part of the book presents the design of a quantitative association rule mining algorithm. Quantitative association rules refer to a special type of association rules of the form that antecedent implies consequent consisting of a set of numerical or quantitative attributes. The introduced mining algorithm processes a specific number of user histories in order to generate a set of association rules with a minimally required support and confidence value. The generated rules show strong relationships that exist between the consequent and the antecedent of each rule, representing different items that have been consumed at specific price levels. This research book will be of appeal to researchers, graduate students, professionals, engineers and computer programmers.","","9788793609631","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228329.pdf&bkn=9218802&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","129","168","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC.

"About the Author","K. Pahlavan",NA,"Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology At the Emergence of Smart World and IoT","","2018","","","471","472","Precise and accurate localization is one of the fundamental scientific and engineering technologies needed for the applications enabling the emergence of the Smart World and the Internet of Things (IoT). Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226938.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"1 Introduction","A. Ibrahim; A. S. Alfa",NA; NA,"Optimization Methods for User Admissions and Radio Resource Allocation for Multicasting over High Altitude Platforms","","2018","","","1","8","This book focuses on the issue of optimizing radio resource allocation (RRA) and user admission control (AC) for multiple multicasting sessions on a single high altitude platform (HAP) with multiple antennas on-board. HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Overview on High Altitude Platforms, their different types and the recent works in this area • Radio Resource Allocation and User Admission Control in HAPs • Multicasting in a Single HAP System: System Model and Mathematical Formulation • Optimization schemes that are designed to enhance the performance of a branch and bound technique by taking into account special mathematical structure in the problem formulation","","9788770220354","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226852.pdf&bkn=9218843&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Higher education helps to improve an individual's quality of life by enabling them to inflate their knowledge and expertise, to grasp abstract concepts and theories, and to raise their awareness of the world and their community, and as such the assurance of quality is becoming more pivotal in the whole education process. There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education. The model integrates four main facets: the Educational System, Quality Assurance Managing and Control, Strategic Planning and Globalization.

The solutions proposed are based on the results of exploratory studies conducted by the author in the areas of Big Data acquisition, cognitive information technologies (cogno-technologies), new methods of analytical verification of digital ecosystems on the basis of similarity invariants and dimensions, and “computational cognitivism,” involving a number of existing models and methods. In practice, this successfully allowed the creation of new entities - the required safe and trusted digital ecosystems - on the basis of the development of digital and cyber security technologies, and the resulting changes in their behavioral preferences. Here, the ecosystem is understood as a certain system of organizations, created around a certain Technological Platform that use its services to make the best offers to customers and access to them to meet the ultimate needs of clients - legal entities and individuals. The basis of such ecosystems is a certain technological platform, created on advanced innovative developments, including the open interfaces and code, machine learning, cloud technologies, Big Data collection and processing, artificial intelligence technologies, etc. The mentioned Technological Platform allows creating the best offer for the client both from own goods and services and from the offers of external service providers in real time. This book contains four chapters devoted to the following subjects: • Relevance of the given scientific-technical problems in the cybersecurity of Digital Economy • Determination of the limiting capabilities • Possible scientific and technical solutions • Organization of perspective research studies in the area of Digital Economy cyber security in Russia.","","9788770220217","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226822.pdf&bkn=9218856&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Index","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","183","184","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226878.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Yadav",NA; NA; NA,"Basics of CNC Programming","","2018","","","377","400","Before the introduction of automatic machines and automation, industrial manufacturing of machines and their parts for the key industries were made though manually operated machines. Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy. As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time. Industry was boosted by the introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy. Thereafter, in the 1970’s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the CNC machine (Computer Numerical Control). Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defence, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry. Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program. The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC. The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc. In so doing, the authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format.

"8 IUCN's Role for Conservation of Nature in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan","M. P. Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","155","203","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226765.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods.

"About the Editors","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","231","232","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies. All parts of the system are generated automatically based on the neuron interconnection scheme in use. The simulator allows exploration of different system configurations, e.g. the interconnection scheme between the neurons, the intracellular concentration of different chemical compounds (ions), which affect how action potentials are initiated and propagate.","","9788770220330","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226827.pdf&bkn=9218606&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Martinov",NA,"Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections","","2018","","","281","308","Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular microorganisms with a homogeneous group-specific antigenic structure, and a unique mode of development. The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and antigenic properties of Chlamydia spp • Genes, genomic structure and genetic regulations • Conventional diagnostic methods and examinations • Detection and differentiation of Chlamydia organisms by DNA detection systems • Clinical forms and manifestations and drug therapy • Pathology • Epidemiological peculiarities of Chlamydia? induced diseases in animals and humans • Immunity and vaccines","","9788793609501","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228370.pdf&bkn=9218814&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"7 Approximate Inference","F.

Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods.

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips.

Rao",NA; NA,"Versatile Video Coding: Latest Advances in Video Coding Standards","","2018","","","19","138","Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 per cent of consumer Internet traffic. Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications, it is necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks. The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG. The MPEG family of video coding standards begun on the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video. MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video. MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground. Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks. However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video. Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known and H.265, was released, with a structure similar to H.264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks. HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and de blocking filters. In 2006 the VC-1 was released. VC-1 is a video codec implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360° Video. The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020. This book presents the new VVC, and updates on the HEVC. The book discusses the advances in lossless coding and covers the topic of screen content coding. Technical topics discussed include: • Beyond the High Efficiency Video Coding • High Efficiency Video Coding encoder • Screen content • Lossless and visually lossless coding algorithms • Fast coding algorithms • Visual quality assessment • Other screen content coding algorithms Overview of JPEG Series","","9788770220460","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226833.pdf&bkn=9218840&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Elayyan",NA; NA,"Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence in Higher Education","","2018","","","249","276","Quality Assurance is not a new concept in the education sector in general, and higher education in particular, though it is becoming increasingly more relevant and important. Higher education helps to improve an individual's quality of life by enabling them to inflate their knowledge and expertise, to grasp abstract concepts and theories, and to raise their awareness of the world and their community, and as such the assurance of quality is becoming more pivotal in the whole education process. There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education. The model integrates four main facets: the Educational System, Quality Assurance Managing and Control, Strategic Planning and Globalization. Also presented are international “best-practices” in quality assurance in higher education, from Japan and Finland.","","9788793609549","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228351.pdf&bkn=9218907&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"6 TOA Positioning in Multipath","K.

Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226939.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"1 IoT Security: An Introduction","",,"Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications","","2018","","","1","18","Internet of Things (IoT) security deals with safeguarding the devices and communications of IoT systems, by implementing protective measures and avoiding procedures which can lead to intrusions and attacks. However, security was never the prime focus during the development of the IoT, hence vendors have sold IoT solutions without thorough preventive measures. The idea of incorporating networking appliances in IoT systems is relatively new, and hence IoT security has not always been considered in the product design. To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet should be segmented into its own network, and have general network access restricted. The network segment should be monitored to identify potential anomalous traffic, and action should be taken if a problem arises. This has generated an altogether new area of research, which seeks possible solutions for securing the devices, and communication amongst them. Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications provides a comprehensive overview of the overall scenario of IoT Security whilst highlighting recent research and applications in the field.

Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228830.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"1 Preliminaries","F. Riguzzi",NA,"Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming: Languages, Semantics, Inference and Learning","","2018","","","1","40","Probabilistic Logic Programming extends Logic Programming by enabling the representation of uncertain information by means of probability theory. Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods. Many examples of the book include a link to a page of the web application http://cplint.eu where the code can be run online.","","9788770220170","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226764.pdf&bkn=9218850&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"About the Editor","",,"MEMS Silicon Oscillating Accelerometers and Readout Circuits","","2018","","","263","264","Most MEMS accelerometers on the market today are capacitive accelerometers that are based on the displacement sensing mechanism. This book is intended to cover recent developments of MEMS silicon oscillating accelerometers (SOA), also referred to as MEMS resonant accelerometer. As contrast to the capacitive accelerometer, the MEMS SOA is based on the force sensing mechanism, where the input acceleration is converted to a frequency output. MEMS Silicon Oscillating Accelerometers and Readout Circuits consists of six chapters and covers both MEMS sensor and readout circuit, and provides an in-depth coverage on the design and modelling of the MEMS SOA with several recently reported prototypes. The book is not only useful to researchers and engineers who are familiar with the topic, but also appeals to those who have general interests in MEMS inertial sensors. The book includes extensive references that provide further information on this topic.","","9788770220446","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226837.pdf&bkn=9218867&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In this sense, and increasingly, entrepreneurship courses have arisen in several universities and many of the courses in the management, administration and engineering areas already offer entrepreneurship curricular units. Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan. It is also relevant to mention the inclusion of “Chapter V – Prototype description” which is innovative and intends to take into account the application of this business plan template to the information technology sector.","","9788770220385","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226879.pdf&bkn=9218898&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education.

Chakrabarty",NA; NA; NA,"Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip","","2018","","","157","158","Recent microfluidic technologies have brought a complete paradigm shift in automating biochemical processing on a tiny lab-on-chip (a.k.a. biochip) that replaces expensive and bulky instruments traditionally used in implementing bench-top laboratory protocols. Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Basics of digital and flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip • Comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sample preparation algorithms • Sample-preparation algorithms for digital microfluidic lab-on-chip • Sample-preparation algorithms for flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip","","9788770220545","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227013.pdf&bkn=9218912&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"7 Introduction to Positioning Algorithms","K. Pahlavan",NA,"Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology At the Emergence of Smart World and IoT","","2018","","","235","268","Precise and accurate localization is one of the fundamental scientific and engineering technologies needed for the applications enabling the emergence of the Smart World and the Internet of Things (IoT). Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226942.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"About the Editors","",,"Atlas of Cilia Bioengineering and Biocomputing","","2018","","","185","186","Cilia are microscopic finger-like cell-surface organelles possessed by a great many eukaryotic organisms, including humans, whose purposes include generating local fluid movements via rhythmic whip-like beating and environmental sensing. Despite intense research efforts since their discovery by van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670's, several key questions regarding ciliary functions, experimental manipulation and in silico imitation remain unanswered. Major justifications for cilia research lie in their involvement in various forms of human disease (ciliopathies) and their ability to instantiate decentralised, asynchronous sensorial-actuation of adjacent matter through modulation of beating characteristics. Further elucidation of these characteristics, which is a problem requiring the combined expertise of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and life scientists, will lead to novel biomedical therapies, creation of 'smart' actuating surfaces for microfluidics/lab-on-chip applications and a greater understanding of fluid mechanics in real-world scenarios. This lavishly-illustrated anthology presents recent advances in the fields of ciliary investigation, manipulation, emulation, mimesis and modelling from key researchers in their fields: its goal is to explain the state-of-the-art in cilia bioengineering and bio-computation in a uniquely creative, accessible manner, towards encouraging further transdisciplinary work in the field as well as educating a broad spectrum of scientists and lay people. The volume is split into three distinct but interwoven themes: 1. Biology: Biological preliminaries for the study of cilia; the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering of ciliated cells for biomedical purposes; reprogramming of cilia dynamics in live cells. 2. Engineering: Creation of macro cilia robots for object sorting applications; pneumatic cilia for the optimization of fluid motion; electrostatic, magnetic and MEMS cilia for microfluidic mixing; reviews in artificial cilia fabrication, actuation and flow induction methods. 3. Numerical and computational modelling. Analyses of thin film cilia for `lab on chip' microfluidic mixing applications; modelling of gel-based artificial cilia towards simulating dynamic behaviors of responsive cilia layers in complex fluids across a wide range of potential applications.","","9788770220033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226781.pdf&bkn=9218773&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods.

HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements.

In this sense, and increasingly, entrepreneurship courses have arisen in several universities and many of the courses in the management, administration and engineering areas already offer entrepreneurship curricular units. Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan. It is also relevant to mention the inclusion of “Chapter V – Prototype description” which is innovative and intends to take into account the application of this business plan template to the information technology sector.","","9788770220385","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226882.pdf&bkn=9218898&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This superlative growth of data consumption has come about due to several reasons, such as evolution of the consumer devices, the types of telephone and smartphone being used, convergence of services, digitisation of economic transactions, tele-education, telemedicine, m-commerce, virtual reality office, social media, e-governance, e-security, to name but a few. Not only has the society transformed to a digital world, but also the expectations from the services provided have increased many folds. The last mile/meters of delivery of all e-services is now required to be wireless. It has always been known that wireless links are the bottleneck to providing high data rates and high quality of service. Several wireless signalling and performance analysis techniques to overcome the hurdles of wireless channels have been developed over the last decade, and these are fuelling the evolution of 4G towards 5G.

Bhandari",NA,"Green Web-II: Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN","","2018","","","99","124","In dealing with the IUCN, one must bear in mind that there never has been, and undoubtedly never will be, any other organization even remotely resembling it. Its peculiarities, subtleties and complexities are sometimes mind-boggling (Nicholson 1990 in Holdgate 1999: ix). Green Web-II investigates IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, an international organization, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states with different capacities of South Asia. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in bio-diversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at global, regional and country level. This study is the first detailed scholarly study on the IUCN as an organization as well as on its efforts in biodiversity conservation. This book adds to our knowledge, firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. IOs, especially International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have long been the subject of mostly political science. Secondly, it applies a fuller sociological imagination to the study of IOs by critically exploring one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how the IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Additionally, the book explores the recent development of the green economy (GE) concepts into IUCN's program planning today. The green economy initiative applies a people-first approach. Although the concept is relatively new, this research explores the theoretical development of a green economy and illustrates how this theory is applied in IUCN's program planning to program implementation. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Motivation of Environment Conservation - How personal efforts make difference • Role of International Environment Conservation Organizations • Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theory • Governance performances and Competitiveness • Popularity indices • Knowledge creation and diffusion • Conservation commons","","9788770220118","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226714.pdf&bkn=9218826&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The idea of incorporating networking appliances in IoT systems is relatively new, and hence IoT security has not always been considered in the product design. To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet should be segmented into its own network, and have general network access restricted. The network segment should be monitored to identify potential anomalous traffic, and action should be taken if a problem arises. This has generated an altogether new area of research, which seeks possible solutions for securing the devices, and communication amongst them. Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications provides a comprehensive overview of the overall scenario of IoT Security whilst highlighting recent research and applications in the field.

"6 Quality Assurance Piloting the E-Learning Sector","A. O. A. Jaber; H. O. Elayyan",NA; NA,"Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence in Higher Education","","2018","","","153","190","Quality Assurance is not a new concept in the education sector in general, and higher education in particular, though it is becoming increasingly more relevant and important. Higher education helps to improve an individual's quality of life by enabling them to inflate their knowledge and expertise, to grasp abstract concepts and theories, and to raise their awareness of the world and their community, and as such the assurance of quality is becoming more pivotal in the whole education process. There is no simple definition of the concept of quality in education, though numerous models and theories have been devised. Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence of Higher Education is a new episode of the Quality Assurance perception in higher education, which identifies the quality culture and orientation from the beginning, integrating crucial factors to build a “pyramid” of higher education excellence. The book compares concepts from the main theories of Quality Assurance, management and control when they are applied to educational systems in higher education. The book also presents a new model of excellence in higher education. Excellence is an architecture of building blocks that comes with process performance, effectiveness, harmony and collaboration which should be incorporated in a quality-oriented concept of a sustainable excellence of higher education. The model integrates four main facets: the Educational System, Quality Assurance Managing and Control, Strategic Planning and Globalization. Also presented are international “best-practices” in quality assurance in higher education, from Japan and Finland.","","9788793609549","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228299.pdf&bkn=9218907&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others. They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip. In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios. However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design. Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip attempts to bridge the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation with digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips.

The solutions proposed are based on the results of exploratory studies conducted by the author in the areas of Big Data acquisition, cognitive information technologies (cogno-technologies), new methods of analytical verification of digital ecosystems on the basis of similarity invariants and dimensions, and “computational cognitivism,” involving a number of existing models and methods. In practice, this successfully allowed the creation of new entities - the required safe and trusted digital ecosystems - on the basis of the development of digital and cyber security technologies, and the resulting changes in their behavioral preferences. Here, the ecosystem is understood as a certain system of organizations, created around a certain Technological Platform that use its services to make the best offers to customers and access to them to meet the ultimate needs of clients - legal entities and individuals. The basis of such ecosystems is a certain technological platform, created on advanced innovative developments, including the open interfaces and code, machine learning, cloud technologies, Big Data collection and processing, artificial intelligence technologies, etc. The mentioned Technological Platform allows creating the best offer for the client both from own goods and services and from the offers of external service providers in real time.

HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services. They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure. An important requirement that the book focusses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting. Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system. Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups. From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements. High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan. Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i.e. receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements.

"3 A Real-Time Hybrid Neuron Network for Highly Parallel Cognitive Systems","",,"Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems","","2018","","","49","80","Simulation of brain neurons in real-time using biophysically-meaningful models is a pre-requisite for comprehensive understanding of how neurons process information and communicate with each other, in effect efficiently complementing in-vivo experiments. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), propagated information is not just encoded by the firing rate of each neuron in the network, as in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but, in addition, by amplitude, spike-train patterns, and the transfer rate. The high level of realism of SNNs and more significant computational and analytic capabilities in comparison with ANNs, however, limit the size of the realized networks. Consequently, the main challenge in building complex and biophysically-accurate SNNs is largely posed by the high computational and data transfer demands. Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems presents novel real-time, reconfigurable, multi-chip SNN system architecture based on localized communication, which effectively reduces the communication cost to a linear growth. The system use double floating-point arithmetic for the most biologically accurate cell behavior simulation, and is flexible enough to offer an easy implementation of various neuron network topologies, cell communication schemes, as well as models and kinds of cells. The system offers a high run-time configurability, which reduces the need for resynthesizing the system. In addition, the simulator features configurable on- and off-chip communication latencies as well as neuron calculation latencies. All parts of the system are generated automatically based on the neuron interconnection scheme in use. The simulator allows exploration of different system configurations, e.g. the interconnection scheme between the neurons, the intracellular concentration of different chemical compounds (ions), which affect how action potentials are initiated and propagate.","","9788770220330","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226892.pdf&bkn=9218606&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In this sense, and increasingly, entrepreneurship courses have arisen in several universities and many of the courses in the management, administration and engineering areas already offer entrepreneurship curricular units. Throughout those programs, the teams develop key integrated competencies in innovation, entrepreneurship and technology that will ultimately enable the students to create and develop new technology-based businesses. The Business Plan Reference Manual for IT Businesses provides a reference manual for undergraduate and graduate students that intend to launch their start-up business in the IT field. It helps them to create and model the business plan of their business. Therefore, this manual is mainly aimed at instructors who want to offer a practical view of the process of modeling, designing and developing an IT start-up. Additionally, it can be individually used by entrepreneurs who wish to launch their start-up businesses in IT field. The structure of the book was defined taking into account different approaches to the construction of the business plan, which basically consider a disaggregation of some of these chapters in others smaller (e.g., marketing plan into products/services and market, financial plan into investment plan and economic-financial projections). We chose to aggregate these dimensions into a single chapter, which in our view facilitates the process of analyzing a business plan. It is also relevant to mention the inclusion of “Chapter V – Prototype description” which is innovative and intends to take into account the application of this business plan template to the information technology sector.","","9788770220385","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226864.pdf&bkn=9218898&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Probabilistic Logic Programming is at the intersection of two wider research fields: the integration of logic and probability and Probabilistic Programming. Logic enables the representation of complex relations among entities while probability theory is useful for model uncertainty over attributes and relations. Combining the two is a very active field of study. Probabilistic Programming extends programming languages with probabilistic primitives that can be used to write complex probabilistic models. Algorithms for the inference and learning tasks are then provided automatically by the system. Probabilistic Logic programming is at the same time a logic language, with its knowledge representation capabilities, and a Turing complete language, with its computation capabilities, thus providing the best of both worlds. Since its birth, the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming has seen a steady increase of activity, with many proposals for languages and algorithms for inference and learning. Foundations of Probabilistic Logic Programming aims at providing an overview of the field with a special emphasis on languages under the Distribution Semantics, one of the most influential approaches. The book presents the main ideas for semantics, inference, and learning and highlights connections between the methods.

Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990's. Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990's. Because of complexity and diversity of science and technology involved in indoor Geolocation, this area has emerged as its own discipline over the past two decades. At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology. Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices. Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation. To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques. Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization. Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems. Material presented in the book are beneficial for the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects. The book provides examples with supporting MATLAB codes and hands-on projects throughout to improve the ability of the readers to understand and implement variety of algorithms. It can be used for both academic education, as a textbook with problem sets and projects, and the industrial training, as a practical reference book for professionals involved in design and performance evaluation. The author of this book has pioneering research experience and industrial exposure in design and performance evaluation of indoor geolocation based on empirical measurement and modeling of the behavior of the radio propagation in indoor areas and inside the human body. The presentation of the material is based on examples of research and development that his students have performed in his laboratory, his teaching experiences as a professor, and his experiences as a technical consultant to successful startup companies.","","9788770220507","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9226834.pdf&bkn=9218820&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The infections caused by them are unprecedented and wide-spread throughout the world, including a broad range of hosts among domestic and animal species and humans, and a variety of clinical manifestations. The uniqueness of chlamydia pathology consists mainly in the fact that the agents of the individual diseases are so close in their biological properties that they are represented only by the single genus Chlamydia, which includes all currently recognized species. Although chlamydiae and chlamydial infections were discovered a long time ago, they are still under-researched and relatively unknown to broad circles of microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians. A number of issues relating to molecular biology, pathogenesis, mechanisms of Chlamydia development and their interactions with cells, as well as their genetic conditioning and regulation, remain unclear. The same is true for ambiguities, problems and contradictions related to epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, immunity and vaccines. Based on scientific facts and the analysis of literature, and the experience of the author, Chlamydiae and Chlamydial Infections attempts to shed light on the cited problems, in terms of modern microbiology, cell biology and molecular biology.

Modulation Theory is intended to serve as a complementary textbook for courses dealing with Modulation Theory or Communication Systems, but also as a professional book, for engineers who need to update their knowledge in the communications area. The modulation aspects presented in the book use modern concepts of stochastic processes, such as autocorrelation and power spectrum density, which are novel for undergraduate texts or professional books, and provides a general approach for the theory, with real life results, applied to professional design. This text is suitable for the undergraduate as well as the initial graduate levels of Electrical Engineering courses, and is useful for the professional who wants to review or get acquainted with the a modern exposition of the modulation theory. The books covers signal representations for most known waveforms, Fourier analysis, and presents an introduction to Fourier transform and signal spectrum, including the concepts of convolution, autocorrelation and power spectral density, for deterministic signals. It introduces the concepts of probability, random variables and stochastic processes, including autocorrelation, cross-correlation, power spectral and cross-spectral densities, for random signals, and their applications to the analysis of linear systems. This chapter also includes the response of specific non-linear systems, such as power amplifiers. The book presents amplitude modulation with random signals, including analog and digital signals, and discusses performance evaluation methods, presents quadrature amplitude modulation using random signals. Several modulation schemes are discussed, including SSB, QAM, ISB, C-QUAM, QPSK and MSK. Their autocorrelation and power spectrum densities are computed. A thorough discussion on angle modulation with random modulating signals, along with frequency and phase modulation, and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is provided. Their power spectrum densities are computed using the Wiener-Khintchin theorem.","","9788793609358","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228229.pdf&bkn=9218890&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The examined power system models are composed of a main study area of interest, an influential buffer area, and a remote external area that can be reduced. The proposed strategy consists in partitioning the external area into coherent clusters and simplifying each of them distinctively. During the reduction of a given cluster, the presence of the system surrounding this cluster is reproduced by building an equivalent system. This equivalent system is made up of the adjacent clusters only; it accounts for the coherent nature of the neglected clusters, and it recognizes the prominent role of voltage phase angle inputs after an electrical fault. The reduction rate of the various clusters is a function of a maximum tolerated deviation for the interconnected system defined in the H-infinity norm.

Like other complex scientific domains, developmental biology can greatly benefit from real-time interactive systems (RIS). In addition to utilizing various innovative RIS technologies, highly efficient domain models have to be provided as well. In this paper, we present a prototypical RIS for developmental biology research that achieves this goal by adapting an existing, GPU-driven, position-based physics engine called FleX to support the required biological interaction mechanisms. The adapted cell model is further augmented by a GPU-based substance diffusion system that simulates biochemical signals that allow cells to communicate and react to their environment. We present model specifics with an emphasis on their efficient integration in an existing game engine, and we elaborate on future improvements.","","978-1-5386-6272-4","10.1109/SEARIS44442.2018.9180233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180233","Computing methodologies—Interactive simulation;Computing methodologies—Agent/discrete models;Computing methodologies—Real-time simulation","Biological system modeling;Solid modeling;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Physics;Engines","biological tissues;biology computing;biomechanics;cellular biophysics;computer games;graphics processing units;interactive systems;molecular biophysics","developmental biology research;position-based physics engine;biological interaction mechanisms;cell model;GPU-based substance diffusion system;GPU-driven physics;biology research RIS;real-time interactive systems;RIS technologies;FleX engine","","","","24","IEEE","31 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, most VR applications targeted towards large scale 3D displays or projection systems, are standalone solutions built for a particular use case, such as CAD review or ergonomic analysis. Where required, 2D information is integrated into these 3D environments on a casual basis only, which leads to significant constraints on the possible workflows with these applications. A more tight integration of common 2D applications with VR in a common interaction environment could greatly widen the range of use cases for 3D/VR applications, as users would no longer be required to explicitly switch from a 2D (GUI-like) to a VR user interface and vice-versa. Instead, 2D and VR applications would both reside in one single interaction space, in which users work with 2D and 3D information and the associated application software in a seamless way.In this paper, we describe the Virtual Desktop One (VD1) system, our concept and implementation of a seamless 2D/3D interaction environment that integrates existing, unmodified GUI-based and 3D/VR applications into a common visualization and interaction space, which supports different interaction devices and modes. We propose a highly flexible and efficient method of VR application integration, which requires only minor modifications to existing VR application software. We describe the architecture of VD1, along with relevant implementation aspects. We further describe the evaluation by an example of VR application integration, and discuss the benchmark and usability results we have obtained so far.","","978-1-5386-6272-4","10.1109/SEARIS44442.2018.9180231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180231","Graphical User Interfaces;3D Interfaces;2D-3D User Interface;Hybrid Desktop Environment2D-3D Integration","Two dimensional displays;Three-dimensional displays;Microsoft Windows;Graphical user interfaces;Windows;Input devices","data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;three-dimensional displays;virtual reality","Virtual Desktop One system;visualization;VR application integration;VR application software;hybrid 2D and 3D desktop environment;large scale 3D displays;3D interaction environment;2D interaction environment;interaction device;usability;VR user interface;interaction environment;projection systems;immersive virtual reality;GUI desktop;VD1","","2","","25","IEEE","31 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These devices deliver various types of tracking information such as a simple full body skeleton (e.g. Microsoft Kinect v2) or a detailed hand skeleton (e.g. Leap Motion). Various device abstraction layers exist, making it easy to connect to such diverse input devices. However, when an application is connected to two or more individual input devices, these devices often provide complementary or multiple, but inconsistent tracking information. To make best use of the available data, and by that, achieving the best tracking quality, proper fusion of the information is required. Hence, we present the design and architecture of the ALVR system (Abstraction Layer for Virtual Reality). On the one hand, ALVR decouples vendor-specific interfaces from the application. On the other hand, it builds and maintains a data model representing a human skeleton. ALVR may receive data from various tracking devices. It then merges redundant tracking data and integrates unique tracking data into this data model. Thereby, application developers gain access to holistic tracking information. This integrated approach - data fusion with device abstraction - allows application developers to maximize the usage of their tracking devices while optimizing the information provided by them, e.g. for gesture recognition.","","978-1-5386-6272-4","10.1109/SEARIS44442.2018.9180232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180232","H.5.2 [User Interfaces]: User Interfaces—Graphical user interfaces (GUI);H.5.m [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Miscellaneous","Data models;Data integration;Virtual reality;Tracking;Skeleton;Input devices","data models;gesture recognition;human computer interaction;sensor fusion;virtual reality","data model;human skeleton;redundant tracking data;holistic tracking information;data fusion;composite body-tracking;device abstraction layer;virtual reality applications;body tracking hardware;simple full body skeleton;hand skeleton;tracking information;tracking quality;vendor-specific interface","","","","18","IEEE","31 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This can further be extended to the broader class of non-linear nodal reconfigurations at substations. In this paper, we present an expert system to automatically discover such topological remedial actions on congested grid states. It comes with a new adapted grid representation, conditional to the congestions of interest, which can be interpreted by operators. To test our expert system, we independently run it on thousands of realistic congested French grid states from 2012 to 2014 with a remedial action discovery success rate of 75%.

Among the various control methods, Hysteresis Current Controllers (HCC) are still quite popular due to their simple implementation, fast transient response and robustness. On the downside, power converters with HCC are compromised by stochastic variable switching frequencies. While low order frequency components lead to resonance oscillations, those of higher order are equally undesired due to significant thermal loading. Especially in high-power applications, control over the switching frequency is desired. In this work, a novel control approach based on a variable hysteresis bandwidth is proposed to achieve a nearly constant average switching frequency. Additional state feedback controller are implemented for active resonance damping.

"Novel 2-D bifacial solar cell using large built-in internal electric fields: A p-i-n structure simulation","G.

The mainstream manufacturing approach is to process the cells from Si wafers, and then assemble these cells into photovoltaic (PV) modules. However, the direct conversion of solar energy into electricity using the photovoltaic effect suffers from low efficiency. Thus, increasing the conversion efficiency at low production costs becomes the main goal of solar cells manufacturers. One way to increase the efficiency of a solar cell is to use an ultra-wide layer of intrinsic semiconductor as the depletion region of a P-N junction. Computer simulation shows that an intrinsic layer of 1 μm thickness results in an increase of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency by 4.85% for conventional single-crystalline silicon P-N junction. In our work, we present a novel geometrical concept of a PIN structure for PV applications. The width of the intrinsic layer in our construction is 5–20 mm. Moreover, in our novel structure, the light irradiation acts directly on the active region of the PV cell, which enables bi-facial irradiation and results in ∼28% conversion efficiency. A low-cost fabrication is ensured in our design due to a new manufacturing technology by eliminating some expensive processes, such as photolithography. The feasibility proof of the novel concept in mono-crystalline silicon solar cells is presented. We demonstrate simulation results and preliminary experimental results confirming our approach. Detailed computer simulations show that the voltage drop and accordingly the high and constant electric field within the intrinsic region of the structure take place for sufficiently small sizes of the region (up to 200–300 nm). With extension of the intrinsic region length the field becomes extremely uneven with peak values at the p-i and i-n junctions. The field strength falls from tens of thousands Volts per centimeter to hundreds of Volts per centimeter for 5 μm intrinsic zone and after 10 μm the field practically disappears. Analysis of the simulation results, electrons and holes concentration profiles, space charge and electric field distributions, brings the idea that the uncompensated charges of the donors and acceptors at the n-i and p-i junctions are the source of the built-in field in the intrinsic region. The simulation of the p-i-n structure equilibrium state was done by the Silvaco's ATLAS silicon device simulator.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128203","LATERAL SOLAR CELLS;BUILT-IN FIELD;PIN STRUCTURE","","","","","","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In the first stage, an optimal reactive powerflow optimizes the reactive power dispatch iteratively for the considered period using successive linear programming with an embedded discretization process. The second stage determines the optimal switching times based on the grid losses of individually optimized time-coupled periods. For deriving reactive power schedules, the time intervals between switching operations as well as the utilization of certain reactive power compensators by a closed-loop are investigated. By investigating sensitivities, it becomes apparent that the automation of flexible devices like STATCOMs enables a reduction of switching actions for the remaining devices.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128175","","","","","","3","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This high voltage interstate tie line continues its no-load operating regime due to non-engineering reasons. This condition is due to mutually contested power system infrastructure claims relating to the wider Kosovo-Serbia dispute and it causes the non-implementation of the already signed connection agreement between the TSO of Kosovo (KOSTT) and the ENTSO-E. This is a unique case of such a high-capacity and costly inter-state tie-line operating idly for over two years. Continuing the no-load operating regime of this tie line causes considerable amount of energy losses due to high capacitive generation of the line, leakage and corona losses. The voltage rise at the receiving end of this long high-voltage tie-line additionally increases its no-load losses as well as causing higher operating/over/voltage profiles in the regional high-voltage network. Hence the paper makes a comparative analysis of the calculated no-load energy losses vs the measured on-site tie-line losses. Calculations are carried out by the PSS/E power system software as well as by the Matlab one. Multiple series connected pi-sections line model are used for calculations of the no-load tie-line losses.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128213","HIGH-VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION LINE NO-LOAD LOSSES;CAPACITIVE LINE GENERATION;HIGH VOLTAGE LINE LEAKAGE CURRENTS;KOSOVO-ALBANIA POWER SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION","","","","","","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Especially oscillating loads at mechanical components induced through aerodynamics of the wind rotor cause additional expenses for maintenance. Real-time simulations of WECSs which include models of the wind rotor to simulate transients, facilitate the analysis of these oscillating loads and the development of advanced control algorithms for oscillation damping. Therefore, this paper presents a model of the wind rotor with adjustable accuracy and examines its influence on simulation results. Different wind effects that cause oscillating loads are analyzed using wind rotor models with varying accuracy.

Isolated systems are an effective solution to address the energy poverty issue. Hybrid microgrids, integrating conventional units and RES (Renewable Energy Sources) generators, are the most suitable option because they exploit resources which are locally available, clean, free and usually abundant. Both the planning and the operation phase are made particularly challenging by the intermittent nature of RES production and by the unpredictability of the demand behaviour and evolution in developing contexts. This work tackles this issue by developing a robust scheduling algorithm and providing a solution which guarantees the requested energy even in the worst possible condition, i.e. maximum demand and minimum RES production. A complete analysis of the reformulation procedure has been performed, in order to describe how to get a tractable counterpart by exploiting the strong duality theorem. The model has been applied to the case study of a missionary centre in Wau, South Sudan. It has been implemented in GAMS and the results have been compared with the output of the deterministic version of the algorithm.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128188","ROBUST OPTIMIZATION;SCHEDULING;REFORMULATION;MICROGRID;ELECTRIFICATION","","","","","","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To overcome this problem a large number of households are using diesel generators, either private or shared installed at the neighborhood location. If the existing diesel generators are best placed could provide benefits to the grid by providing flexibility in localized areas and help to avoid or reduce the number of blackouts. This paper is proposing a methodology to find the best placement and the right size of the diesel generators in the Baghdad area. The optimization of these two parameters will reduce the real power losses, stabilize the grid voltage, and increase the network performance. This optimization approach will also contribute to minimizing the level of acoustical noise for existing diesel generators which they are installed at the neighborhood location. The objective function is looking to minimize the real power losses of the network and keeping the voltage within the permissible levels.

In sensitive areas, such as machinery diagnostics, such uncertainties could also have a negative impact on decision-making processes. For that reason, any additional confirmation that yields a better understanding of BSS algorithm capabilities and the issues that may arise from using this method in solving audio-based diagnostic problems is desirable. In this paper, the focus is placed on On Load Tap Changer (OLTC) audio-based diagnostics. The dominant audio signals that mix with the carrier of the useful diagnostic material, in this case, express stationary character. Given the fact that the targeted OLTC audio fingerprint usually represents a highly non-stationary signal that appears only in a certain period when compared to these interferences, it is possible to develop a source separation method based on a simple modeling approach. For that purpose, in this paper, a non-linear latest square curve fitting method was used for the extraction of the OLTC audio fingerprint, which was then used as a reference for testing the source separation efficiency of several different ICA algorithms.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128205","OLTC;AUDIO-BASED DIAGNOSTICS;BSS;ICA","","","","","1","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The failure rates of transmission lines are often estimated based on aggregated statistics given in failure rate per unit length of transmission line. These failure rates are key input parameters to power system reliability assessments. When length data are not available, such data need to be estimated to carry out reliability assessments. A simple and practical method is proposed for estimating transmission line lengths from the electrical parameters inductance and capacitance (which normally are available in grid data sets). The validity of the method is corroborated by testing it on a grid data set of the Danish transmission system that contains length information. The average error was 3.7% for calculating the length of overhead lines and 27.3% for estimating the length of all transmission lines (overhead, cable and combinations of these). The value of the method is illustrated by applying it in a case study on the reliability assessment of a part of the Norwegian transmission system, where length information was not available.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128181","","","","","","","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Currently, distribution network planning is rather inefficient as network assets are oversized to meet the peak demand of a worst case scenario which is unlikely to occur. In addition, flexibility provided by controllable loads is not taken into account at all. This paper presents an innovative approach that integrates the potential flexibility of distributed energy resources in the planning exercise. It incorporates two optimization problems: a low-level one to optimize the operation of controllable resources; and a high-level one based on an OPF that uses the available flexibility to solve network problems. The proposed method allows obtaining cost-effective solutions that make a better use of the flexible resources available, avoiding high capital investments in network reinforcement.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128139","Demand Side Management;Distribution Reinforcement Planning;Resources Flexibility;Shiftable Loads","","","","","1","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To this end, the paper explores the integration to TSO operations of the flexibility options provided by DSOs at the TSO-DSO interfaces, focusing specifically on short-term (real-time) active power balance satisfaction. The flexibility at a TSO-DSO interface is roughly modeled, after aggregation by the DSO, as active/reactive power box constraints inside which the DSO constraints are met. The paper develops a tailored AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem, supporting the TSO to cover active power deficit at least cost by the adjustment of conventional generators and flexibility options from ADSs, while integrating flexibility constraints at TSO-DSOs interface besides classical constraints.

The base load generating units of island systems are usually cheap, yet inflexible heavy fuel oil fired generators with large installed capacity and high technical minimum loading (TML) levels (in many cases up to 60% of the installed capacity). The higher TML of low-cost units renders them inflexible, particularly in low demand hours, where in some cases is necessary to dispatch flexible but costly peaking units (e.g. gas turbines), in order for the technical and security constraints of the unit commitment and economic dispatch (UC-ED) problem to be satisfied. This paper proposes a new UC ED method, solely based on the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach, incorporating a bi-level TML technique for the conventional units of isolated island power systems aiming at avoiding the commitment of costly generation during low demand days.

This paper explores the application of image processing tools to distinguish grid-expansion from off-grid consumer clusters spatially, considering peak-load surfaces. Instead of point-based cluster analysis, the proposed model induces morphological pixel changes in the image through filtering and segmentation techniques. This way, load clusters can be isolated based on texture and coherence in an unprecedented way. Various single and sequential image processing techniques are compared, together with a rough grid expansion-ratio estimate for each case.

Improving building energy consumption is one of the most used strategies intending to balance this trade off. Recently used techniques to improve consumption mainly focus on data-mining and time series prediction approaches. Mentioned methods are known as Machine Learning approaches, have shown a rapid growth also due to increase of gathered sensor data. Mainly, these approaches improve consumption by fitting a regression model to measured data in order to give anticipatory information for load demand. Also, there is a necessity of applying data mining techniques to improve regression model performance. Clustering techniques are used in this work to group similar daily load patterns. Clustering approaches are widely used to identify daily patterns in time series like wind power and electricity consumption. Here, we apply K-means clustering to classify daily load profiles for a commercial building. The following steps are done: first, raw data are transformed to reduce time series dimensionality by applying different representations. Then best performing cluster separation, is estimated and then daily patterns are classified into k-selected similar clusters. This work serves as an improving tool for energy consumption machine learning predictor model. Grouping similar building energy demand patterns into subgroups, will help for training different learning models on these subset of data and then predicting short term building energy consumption.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128135","","","","","","","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Co-simulation environments can be centrally orchestrated or decentrally orchestrated, each having its own set of advantages and challenges. In this paper we analyse the merits and challenges of co-simulation for collaborative simulation between institutions through two simple co-simulation environments, one centralized and the other decentralized. We argue that a co-simulation environment for collaboration between institutions should provide functionality like standard co-simulation interfaces for a variety of simulation tools, remote management and configuration, model compatibility checks, and failure detection and recovery. An environment with these characteristics can be easily adopted by a wide range of institutions, which would greatly aid in tackling the complexity of modern electrical power systems.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128160","","","","","","","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Solar forecasting, in short spatial and time scales, such as 0–1000 m and 0–30 min. is a challenging task for numerical weather predictions using satellite images due to technical restrictions (long intervals and low-resolution satellite images). Hence, in recent time, images from ground-based sky cameras are more and more used. Therefore, methods utilizing ground-based sky images successfully deal with considerable cloud spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, an overview of existing methods for short-term solar forecast will be presented following with research on how to improve them in terms of forecast system equipment cost and accuracy.

Together, ambient and ringdown analysis provide accurate, near real-time awareness of electromechanical oscillations. Postprocessing logic is an issue for parametric methods, as higher model orders often are chosen to improve the estimation process.

However, for High-Temperature Low-Sag (HTLS) conductors that can operate at “high” temperature, this simplified characterization may not be sufficient due to high dissipated heat released from the upstream conductor to the nearby conductors located at the downstream position. COMSOL is used to further evaluate and provide initial insight on the thermal state of each conductors within bundle system. The results indicate that the use of simplified current-temperature relationship for bundled conductor (Joree, 47.75 mm) could overload the downstream conductor up to 4.5°C (2.25%) when is rated at I200°C.

There is a general consensus in Literature that time series of consumption and generation are necessary to properly represent the impact of demand coincidence and of generation-load homotheticity. Thus, accurate modelling of production and demand becomes crucial to make rational hypotheses for network development and management, both at MV and LV level. Worldwide TSOs and DSOs use typical daily profiles for representing the consumption of the end-users. Updating these typical load profiles to the new behavior of current customers is often disregarded, and the used profiles refer to out-of-date and limited measurement campaigns.

The possibility to connect a storage device in the DC link, provided by a three-stage configuration (AC/DC/AC), fully decouples the control possibilities between Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltages (LV) grid sides. Even though energy storage cannot be considered, the frequency control of the LV grid can be also decoupled from the MV grid.

This paper aims to present and evaluate common tuning methods for PI and state space control structures in elastically coupled drive systems with a very small inertia ratio. The mathematical model of a two-inertia system is used to establish the controller design. For the PI control, the symmetric optimum and the pole placement method are considered. Better oscillation damping can be achieved with the state space control. It produces lower settling times by using all system states for control purposes. Here, an appropriate controller design is necessary to avoid excess levels of the required plant input.

Its relevant standard experimentations have resulted in introducing the Energy Balance Method (EBM) which is the most commonly implemented method in the industry. Besides conductor properties, aerodynamic forces (Lift and Drag forces) acting on the conductor are the main input data for the EBM. The existing models frequently use experimental data of Lift and Drag forces for a cylinder. To further investigate the capabilities of wind-conductor interaction numerical modelling, it is useful to take advantage of Finite Element Modelling techniques. This paper simulates the wind flow around single OHL conductors with different outer layer stranding shapes and sizes utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software. The simulations are based on solving the Navier-Stokes equation to compute the aerodynamic forces by integration of the pressure and shear forces within the boundaries of the conductor geometry. The numerical model computes the aerodynamic forces for three conductor geometries including smooth-surface, round-stranded, and trapezoidal stranding shapes. The numerically obtained solutions show that less aerodynamic forces are experienced by rounds and trapezoids compared to the cylinder geometry. This observation is true for high Reynolds numbers.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128176","CONDUCTORS;AEOLIAN VIBRATIONS;FEM;COMSOL;STRANDING SHAPE","","","","","1","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Stability analysis based on direct methods is a potential approach to assess the instabilities of complex power systems. Computer program-based analysis of computationally efficient and fast converging algorithms under variable and complex operating conditions is discussed in this paper. These computation algorithms determine system's stability along-with the bounds of all possible trajectories. Contrary to the classical stability assessment where time consuming simulations could impact transient performance, this approach is based on pre-disturbance system dynamics and determining stable and unstable equilibrium points with attraction regions.","","978-1-83953-133-0","10.1049/cp.2018.1878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128162","ATTRACTION REGIONS;DIRECT METHOD;EQUILIBRIUM;STABILITY;TRAJECTORIES","","","","","","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Enhanced geothermal systems are artificially made reservoirs while injecting a fluid to make fractures and energy extraction. Some techno-economic issues arise when these enhanced systems are implemented at the particular site (technical, economic, environmental, legal and social impact) and integrated into the heat and electricity grid. This paper gives a short overview of these issues that should be accounted for in the long-term techno-economic modelling.

In vivo measurements included subcutaneous fat thickness (FTh), longissimus dorsi muscle depth (MTh), muscle area (MAr) and muscle circumference (MCir) between the 12th and 13th ribs and the fat tail thickness (FTTV) using real time ultrasound “falco vet” with a 3.5-MHz probe. The same measurements were also taken on carcasses. The carcasses were weighted (CW), then dissected on bone, fat and muscle. Predicting models of muscle and fat content were established using BW and in vivo measurements or CW and carcass ultrasonic measurements. The BW was the most important in vivo indicator to predict carcass composition (54 and 70% for muscle and fat, respectively). These accuracies increased by 11 and 8%, respectively with CW. The in vivo prediction of muscle weight was improved by FTV rather than FTTV (5 vs. 0%). The muscle optimal prediction accuracy (75%) was attended by whole carcass ultrasonic measurements in dorsal and tail sites added to CW. The carcass fat was estimated with the same accuracy (72%) when FTh or FTTh was added to BW. A higher in vivo fat prediction accuracy was obtained when The FTTh was used as independent variable in addition to BW, MAV, MCV and MDV in the multiple regression equations in comparison with the same predicting model containing FTh (79 vs. 77%).

Many statistical, structural and geometric features have been proposed by researchers, for OCRs of different languages. The combination of these features with certain classifier give fairly good accuracy. However, it is still a challenge for recognition of regional language such as Odia. The features that can depict a human way of observation is needed; to enhance the classification methods. This paper is focused on developing a non-handcrafted feature extraction method using convolution, multiplication, and addition with weight filter that can correlate to human perceived features. The weight masks are optimized by JAYA optimization algorithm based on the formulated objective function. Once the optimized weights are obtained, a classifier can be used to classify the character images to its corresponding class. We have used IITBBS handwritten Odia numeral dataset; for validating our model. The recognition accuracy for Odia numeral is found to be 98.25% with Random Forest classifier.","","978-1-5386-7796-4","10.1109/ICINPRO43533.2018.9096757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096757","Convolution Model;Feature Extraction;JAYA Optimization;Non-handcrafted Feature;Optical Character Recognition","Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Optimization;Optical character recognition software;Mathematical model;Convolution;Character recognition","feature extraction;handwritten character recognition;image classification;optical character recognition;optimisation","handwritten Odia-numeral recognition;optimization based feature generation;optical character recognition application;feature extraction method;classification methods;regional language;geometric features;structural features;statistical features;OCR;unconstrained handwritten character recognition;Random Forest classifier;recognition accuracy;IITBBS handwritten Odia numeral dataset;character images;optimized weights;JAYA optimization algorithm;weight masks;human perceived features;weight filter","","5","","16","IEEE","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Still, templates in biometric recognition systems undergo passive issues like security and privacy invasion. To avert the breach of biometric patterns, there is need to alter the actual biometric pattern before accumulating in the database through irreversible or non-invertible operation. The altered template is termed as Cancelable template which perhaps be reissued or replaced in the event of compromise. Although various cancelable biometric schemes were suggested but with extensively diminishing accuracy. In this paper, we come up with novel cancelable iris technique stationed on arbitrary binary filter. Feature vector of iris is formed by utilizing 1-D Log Gabor Filter which is enforced on iris image. Pre-alignment is done to overwhelm rotational invariance and row vector is created from it. A decimal vector is generated after xoring a random vector with the row vector. Cancelable iris template is formed by mapping the decimal values to corresponding indices of binary filter. To affirm the accuracy of our suggested approach, experimentation is done on distinct iris datasets. After employing the approach, we attained Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.98% for CASIA-V 1.0 and 2.6% for CASIA-V3-Interval iris datasets respectively. Furthermore, the technique sustain the revocability, unlinkability and unlinkability attributes of cancelable template.","","978-1-5386-7796-4","10.1109/ICINPRO43533.2018.9096671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096671","Cancelable template;Decimal Vector;Iris;look-up table;Row-vector.","Iris recognition;Iris;Cryptography;Privacy;Authentication;Databases","data privacy;feature extraction;Gabor filters;iris recognition","Cancelable iris template;traditional human authentication systems;passive issues;biometric-based recognition systems;privacy invasion;actual biometric pattern;noninvertible operation;altered template;cancelable template;cancelable biometric schemes;cancelable iris technique;arbitrary binary filter;1-D Log Gabor Filter;iris image;row vector;decimal vector;random vector;distinct iris datasets;CASIA-V3-Interval iris datasets;rotational invariance","","","","27","IEEE","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As there is always a need for fast and robust encryption techniques in image processing, it becomes necessary to compare the different chaotic map techniques based on complexity, execution time and sensitivity to small changes in the plain image. The algorithms for Line map, Cat map and Baker's map were coded in MATLAB and the execution time and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) values were compared. From the simulation results, the best encryption technique has been selected for image processing and that technique will also be faster, more secure, less affected by noise and more sensitive to changes in the encryption key. We have also analyzed the extent of diffusion in these techniques, which is the resolution of the decrypted image in comparison with the original image.

It is imperative to identify such fake profiles at the earliest since such malevolent accounts are often exploited to perpetrate fraud activities, retrieve personal or confidential information from victims, spread false propaganda online or to threaten and bully victims, ensuring that their original identities remain camouflaged. Though such profiles often look realistically convincing, there exist patterns in their behavioural tendencies. In order to curb the existence of such online frauds and help users distinguish between real or possibly fake profiles on Twitter, this paper proposes the extraction of key features such as number of friends, followers, statuses, that these behavioural trends of fake and legitimate users, learnt by various machine learning algorithms can be used in predicting the nature of any Twitter accounts.

Information proprietor computes the signatures for every chunk and deploys in the distributed server in order to allow the public verifier to perform public integrity verification on the information stored on the cloud server. In Panda scheme [1], by using the proxy re-signatures, Cloud Service Provider (CSP) verifies and re-signs the revoked customer chunks in favor of the existing customers. The malicious CSP might use the Resign key deliberately to transform the signature of one customer to another. Apart from this, conspiracy amidst the mischievous cloud server and the repudiated customer reveals the private key information of the customers present in the cluster.

Different routing algorithms have been proposed to solve routing problems of DTNs. One such routing algorithm is MaxProp, which specifies both, packet transmission protocol and buffer management scheme for each node. However, MaxProp possesses a drawback in the step of updating delivery probabilities. While establishing the likeliness of meeting a recently met node, again, the algorithm brings about drastic changes in the delivery probabilities of nodes. This makes the algorithm susceptible to make non-optimal routing decisions. To battle this drastic change, this paper proposes subtle changes in the step concerning updating of delivery probabilities of the nodes which results in optimal routing decision making by the algorithm. Finally, the simulations, done in ONE simulator, elucidate that the proposed routing algorithms outperform the original MaxProp.","","978-1-5386-7796-4","10.1109/ICINPRO43533.2018.9096784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096784","Delay-tolerant networks;MaxProp Routing;ONE simulator;Routing Protocol;Softmax Function","","decision making;delay tolerant networks;mobile radio;probability;routing protocols;telecommunication network management","MaxProp routing protocol;delay-tolerant Networks;DTN;end-to-end links;routing algorithm;packet transmission protocol;buffer management scheme;delivery probabilities;nonoptimal routing decisions;optimal routing decision making;ONE simulator","","2","","24","IEEE","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) databases address the challenges imposed by big data and containerization technologies makes it easy for businesses to get them on-demand as platform-as-a-service. The use of container as base technology for large-scale distributed systems opens many challenges in the area of resource management at run-time such as, auto-scaling, optimal deployment and monitoring. Monitoring is at the heart of many cloud resource management solutions such as, measuring and optimizing performance, budget planning and management. Measuring Workload Skew and resource utilization of MPP databases and analytic engines is the focus of our work. This paper explores the tools available to measure the performance of MPP Docker and Kubernetes environments from the perspective of a Database Administrator using such systems in a virtualized environment. Proposed approach provides a detailed characterization of CPU, memory and network IO, while complex long duration analytic SQL queries are loading compute resources in containerized systems.","","978-1-5386-7796-4","10.1109/ICINPRO43533.2018.9096695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096695","Big Data;Data Analytics;Docker;Kubernetes;Massively Parallel Processing (MPP);Monitoring and Workload Skew","Containers;Engines;Resource management;Monitoring;Databases;Parallel processing;Cloud computing","Big Data;business data processing;cloud computing;data analysis;data mining;parallel databases;query processing;resource allocation;SQL;storage management","budget planning;resource utilization;MPP databases;analytic engines;Database Administrator;complex long duration analytic SQL queries;containerized systems;microservice MPP analytic query engine;Big Data analytics;business domains;complex analytical workloads;Parallel Processing databases;containerization technologies;platform-as-a-service;base technology;large-scale distributed systems;cloud resource management solutions;workload skew measurement","","","","22","IEEE","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As pooling layer helps in reducing high dimensional convolutional features, our main focus is to develop an efficient pooling method which retains the most distinguishable features. In this work, we proposed a pooling approach called cascaded pooling which consists of two pooling methods: max-max pooling and max-average pooling. We evaluated our approach on InceptionV3 architecture of DCNN where the first two max pooling layers are replaced by max-max pooling and the last average pooling layer by max-average pooling and obtained improved classification results on two aerial scene datasets.","","978-1-5386-7796-4","10.1109/ICINPRO43533.2018.9096860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096860","Convolutional Layers;Deep Convolutional Neural Network;Dropout;Fully Connected Layers;Pooling","Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Computer architecture;Biological neural networks;Kernel;Training;Neurons","convolutional neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","aerial scene datasets;average pooling layer;max pooling layers;max-average pooling;max-max pooling;efficient pooling method;high dimensional convolutional features;fully connected layers;training data;overfitting problem;accurate image classification results;DCNN;Deep Convolutional Neural Network;Convolutional Neural networks;cascaded pooling","","2","","12","IEEE","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent times, machine learning research has focused on diagnosing diseases like diabetic retinopathy by extracting features and then classifying the image. In this research our goal is to automatically classify images with retinal problems from those of the healthy ones without performing any explicit segmentation or feature extraction. Rather, we use a deep learning model to automatically classify any retinal fundus image as healthy or diseased. The architecture of the network is both simple and fast. The model has been tested on two datasets, including real patient retinal fundus images obtained from a local hospital. The accuracy of this model has been found to be in the range 96.5 % to 99.7%.","","978-1-5386-7796-4","10.1109/ICINPRO43533.2018.9096838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096838","Retinal Diagnosis;CNN;Deep Learning;Machine Learning;Automated Diagnosis","Retina;Diabetes;Feature extraction;Retinopathy;Machine learning;Biomedical imaging","biomedical optical imaging;diseases;eye;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","diabetic retinopathy;deep learning model;patient retinal fundus images;retinal eye disease detection;retinitis pigmentosa","","7","","14","IEEE","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, today the AI is still done mainly as a way to keep up with a real facial image rather than researching how to discriminate the generated image. As the world that is no longer able to distinguish between real and fake facial images is coming, the need for radical AI technology to detect generated images arises. In this paper, we introduce an approach that addresses these issues, describing in feasible detail the discriminative models based on various machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we show that the model with the highest accuracy in supervised learning achieved a 92.5% detection rate at 7.5% false positive rate (FPR), out of 400 images. And we have also achieved positive results in unsupervised learning. Our results demonstrate that the fake facial images generated by the GAN can be discriminated by the machine learning algorithms. Since GAN models tend to improve rapidly, we foresee new neural network discrimination models gaining in importance as part of a generated image detection strategy in coming years.","","978-1-5386-9210-3","10.1109/ICSSA45270.2018.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092321","AI;GAN;CNN;Clustering;Discrimination","Unsupervised learning;Supervised learning;Gallium nitride;Training;Data models;Solid modeling","face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;unsupervised learning","unsupervised learning;FPR;radical AI technology;generated fake facial images;generated image detection strategy;neural network discrimination models;GAN models;false positive rate;detection rate;machine learning algorithms;discriminative models","","","","13","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in the SOHO (Small Office Home Office) company case, the password for the MS-Office document file could be the affordable and solitary solution for the document security. By setting the password of the document, the owner of the file can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the content of the document file. However, there are issues in this simple security mechanism such as the dependency of the strength of passwords and the difficulty of the password management. In this work, we propose two mechanisms for overcoming these two issues by adding simple but effective mechanisms named the SPT (Secure Password Translation) and the chain of trust. The SPT generates passwords for the MS-Office document files and the generated password has enough strength that the government regulation requires. For the preserving the integrity of the passwords and software components, we propose the chain of trust. By using these mechanisms, SOHO companies can preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the document files. In addition, the implementation of the trust-chain based SPT is easy and affordable to deploy. The contribution of this work is in proposing the design of software for managing passwords of the MS-Office document using SPT and the chain of trust.","","978-1-5386-9210-3","10.1109/ICSSA45270.2018.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092231","Secure Password Translator, Document Security Management, Chain of Trust, SOHO","Password;Companies;Software;Public key;Encryption","authorisation;business data processing;document handling;trusted computing","trust-chain based SPT;password setting;MS-Office document file;SOHO company case;document security;simple security mechanism;generated password;secure password translation;small office home office;document password management","","","","8","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The IoT is a series of interconnected devices capable of sending and receiving data over existing network infrastructure, but why does this matter? Technology is becoming a conventional commodity, while the uses are endless, technological advancement constitutes a very serious risk. Any device that is connected to the Internet poses a heightened security risk. These risks have the potential of compromising the device and its users. Therefore, the understanding of device-level security is critical to protect the users from various security threats. To provide a holistic view of IoT security, the investigated devices are broken down with respect to different domains (e.g., healthcare, commerce, and home). Specifically, this paper presents a survey of frequently used devices with a common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) for each investigated IoT domain.

The more SaaS adoption evolves, the more software service providers compete for fast development to cope with the market pace. This trend pushes security after functionality-needs in the priority list. This, in turn, results in delivering applications with potential security risk. The risk is further elevated due to the lack of visibility, control, and regulatory enforcements over consumers' data associated with such applications. Motivated by the raised necessity to consider security-needs at the same priority as functionality-needs, this paper proposes a comprehensive platform to interweave security activities and services from inception through deployment and beyond. Such activities and services are based on information flow control. The platform specifically envisions these activities to devote security into every phase of the development lifecycle of SaaS applications and offer different style of defenses as security services. It promotes for shared security responsibility to gain twofold benefits: a) it helps service providers to protect their SaaS applications from prevalent security threats; b) it enables SaaS consumers to choose a protected application to process their sensitive data with a trust in its security.","","978-1-5386-9210-3","10.1109/ICSSA45270.2018.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092089","Cloud applications, SaaS Development Lifecycle, Security as a Service, Information Flow Control","Security;Software as a service;Cloud computing;Business;Computer architecture;Monitoring","cloud computing;law;risk management;security of data;software architecture","software capabilities;SaaS adoption;software service providers;market pace;priority list;potential security risk;regulatory enforcements;comprehensive platform;security activities;information flow control;development lifecycle;SaaS applications;security services;shared security responsibility;prevalent security threats;SaaS consumers;protected application;cloud application development cycle;business;individuals tune;software-as-a-service applications","","1","","18","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, a user's voice commands can be canceled by a jamming attack by broadcasting carefully crafted audio signals. When these signals are generated with a frequency that matches the inherent frequency of the target MEMS microphone, the microphone's membrane will resonant at a significantly large amplitude which prevents the device from receiving the victim's command.","","978-1-5386-9210-3","10.1109/ICSSA45270.2018.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092296","sensor-systems;Denial-of-service-attack;Audio-systems;Microelectromechanical-systems","Micromechanical devices;Resonant frequency;Microphones;Jamming;Sensors;Speech recognition;Acoustics","audio signals;jamming;micromechanical devices;microphones;vibrations","voice commands;resonance effect;microelectromechanical systems;portable devices;jamming attack;MEMS devices;MEMS microphone;Hey Siri;MEMS microphones;audio signals;microphone membrane","","1","","10","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All transactions in bit coin recorded in the block-chain and the transactions are validated through mining. When mining, honest miners are rewarded in proportion to their computing power. However, it has been proven that selfish mining can get more mining rewards beyond computing power. Selfish mining intentionally makes block fork of the block-chain and wastes the computing power of honest miners. In this paper, we analyze selfish mining and existing countermeasures, and propose a new method to prevent selfish mining by adding the transaction creation time to the transaction data structure. The proposed method is the highest threshold compared to existing methods, which is 33% threshold required for successful selfish mining. The threshold is also the most optimized result with the probability of an honest miner mining in selfish mining pools to zero.","","978-1-5386-9210-3","10.1109/ICSSA45270.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092106","bitcoin;blockchain;selfish mining","Bitcoin;Data mining;Protocols;Data structures;Standards","cryptocurrencies;data mining;data structures;financial data processing;probability","bitcoin selfish mining prevention;transaction creation time;block-chain technology;computing power;mining rewards;transaction data structure;honest miner mining;selfish mining pools;probability;crypto-currency","","5","","11","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Evaluating these systems is a crucial part of malware prevention research. However, recent datasets that cover different kinds of benign and malicious applications to evaluate the malware detection techniques are often not available. With thousands of newly released applications every day and different new malicious activities discovered, it is difficult to keep malicious application datasets up to date. This paper introduces a recent and adaptive dataset that includes 5,000 applications from different malware categories that can be used by the research community. The applications are selected from more than 5 million applications. To show how the dataset can be used, we deploy a popular malware analysis platform and generate detailed reports on all the applications in an automated way. We also provide the steps to update the dataset and perform the analysis automatically on the updated set of samples.

Especially cryptographic routines as part of an executable are of interest to an analyst. There are already several automated techniques for finding cryptography within a binary available, ranging from static signatures detection to dynamic behavioural observation. This paper presents a novel approach for functionality detection through the disassembly of binaries, lifted into an intermediate representation (IR). A visualization of the IR then aids an human analyst to find functionality. We evaluate the approach with a binary containing the libgcrypt cryptographic library. The results suggest this to be another useful method for visual binary analysis.","","978-1-5386-9210-3","10.1109/ICSSA45270.2018.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092105","Cryptography Detection;Visualization;Intermediate Representation;Intermediate Language","Tools;Encryption;Libraries;Ransomware","cryptography;invasive software;reverse engineering","IR visualization;reverse engineering;malware analysis;cryptographic routines;automated techniques;static signatures detection;dynamic behavioural observation;functionality detection;intermediate representation;human analyst;libgcrypt cryptographic library;visual binary analysis","","","","30","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are constantly connected to internet and the mobile devices in our hands, in some way, make us like sensors capable of acquiring, storing and exchanging information [1]. How do we exploit this potential by making a significant contribution to our history? Can we use these devices to make the cataloguing of historical documents smart, combining future and past? The purpose of this article is to propose a methodology that could support the automatic creation of an historical documents archive, even for non-expert users.

Until the year 312 B.C. the Romans were satisfied to use the water that drew from the Tiber, from wells and springs. Subsequently, with the increase of the city, it became more and more urgent the problem of water supply and, especially following the diffusion of the baths (Fig. 1), the wells and springs were no longer sufficient. The Romans then began to build numerous aqueducts to bring water from distant sources in their cities, supplying thermal baths, fountains and private homes. The aqueducts moved water only by gravity, being constructed with a slight downward slope, within conduits of stone, brick or concrete. All along valleys or plains, the conduit was supported by buildings with arches, or its contents were placed to pressure in lead, ceramic or stone pipes. Most of the systems of aqueducts included sedimentation tanks, sluice gates and distribution tanks to adjust the supply according to the needs. In the present work a 1917 survey of a part of the roman aqueducts was repeated (where possible), and widened to study a model to better estimate their flows.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089735","Acqueducts;Ancient Rome;Leveling;water flow","Urban areas;Benchmark testing;Buildings;Geophysical measurements;Springs;Cultural differences;Global navigation satellite system","building materials;buildings (structures);canals;construction;pipes;rivers;sedimentation;sediments;structural engineering;tanks (containers);water supply","ancient Rome;springs;water supply;baths;aqueducts;distant sources;fountains;private homes;slight downward slope;conduit;buildings;stone pipes;Roman aqueducts","","2","","14","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems suffer from the lack of precise indoor geolocation of visitors within the cultural heritage site. This issue can be resolved by using smartphone (and tablets) embedded sensors, which can catch a huge number of data on visitor behaviour (acceleration, orientation, etc.). This data can be fused using dedicated methods (Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Particle Filter, etc.) in order to estimate visitor position. However, such algorithms are highly dependent on: sampling time, sensors technologies, number of used sensors, etc. With this kind of solution the error in position estimation growth with the covered distance. In this paper, we present an hybrid solution for reducing error in time without additional infrastructure such Wifi, etc. For this, we present an indoor geolocation solution based on smartphone inertial sensors and earth magnetic field. The proposed method is divided into three phases: heading estimation using 3 sensors (accelerometer, compass and gyroscope) with an Extended Kalman Filter, steps detection and step length estimation, error correction using fingerprinting. The proposed solution is implemented on a smartphone (Samsung-Galaxy S7 based on Android OS) and maintain the error under of 1.5m.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089733","Iindoor positioning;Smartphone sensors;Magnetic field;Dead reckoning;Fingerprinting","Magnetometers;Smart phones;Geology;Estimation;Magnetic sensors;Earth","accelerometers;augmented reality;geomagnetic navigation;geomagnetic variations;geophysics computing;gyroscopes;indoor navigation;indoor radio;intelligent sensors;Kalman filters;mobile computing;nonlinear filters;particle filtering (numerical methods);smart phones","Android OS;Samsung-Galaxy S7;smartphone;extended Kalman filter;Wifi infrastructure;virtual reality technology;augmented reality technology;error correction;smartphone inertial sensors;sensors technologies;position estimation;visitor position;particle filter;smartphone embedded sensors;indoor geolocation;virtual tour guide;Earth magnetic field","","1","","25","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

GTG casts the classification problem as a non-cooperative game where the players (the coin images) decide their strategies (class labels) according to the choices made by the others, which results with a global consensus at the final labeling. Experiments are conducted on the only publicly available dataset which is composed of 180 images of 60 types of Roman coins.

The use of H as a consolidated estimator of the frequency response function (FRF) of the studied structure, can take advantage of its application also to other approaches, such as the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) approach. In fact, in the case of ancient masonry and ruined buildings, characterized by high heterogeneities and complexities, modal estimators computed from on-the-field data are typically quite noisy, so that accurate identification of the analyzed structure is sometimes challenging. Through a mutual validation of the results by several methods useful indications on the reliability of findings can be provided. To such purpose, also operational modal analysis (OMA) was performed and compared to modal identification by H function.

This topographical grid, realized in only 3 weeks of work on field, has been used to geo-reference and scale the images taken during an accurate photographical campaign of the painted and decorated walls of the Insula. A traditional survey approach, done using a total station to rectify the images, would have required a long time-consuming process to capture points data for the whole area of the Insula. The integration of the scans with the high-resolution images made possible to document and evaluate quickly the state of art and conservation of the decorated walls. In the future it will be possible to update this archive by adding geo-referenced maps, drawings and photos related to the Insula.

In the archaeological and anthropological sciences, in particular, photogrammetry offers some advantages in the analyses and investigations due to non-contact measurements, high accuracy of their values, possibility of precise photorealistic texture mapping. Photorealistic three-dimensional models of archaeological and anthropological objects and findings can be easily shared and used for public virtual reality and/or for studies in morphometry. Among the mentioned aspects, accuracy and feasibility of the measuring methods are highly relevant; for this reasons the paper presents an approach based on digital photogrammetry providing technological and methodological developments in anthropology and archeology. Objects and human findings unearthed from the ruins of a medieval church in Aquino have been reconstructed through elaboration of close-range photogrammetric imagery. The measurements of 2D and 3D models have been compared with micro-mechanical measurements carried out in a specialized laboratory by using micro-meters and centesimal analogical calipers.

The general aim of the experimental project is to correlate the resonant frequency of the planar sensor, for the different pressures applied to the resonator, with the different levels of water content θv of the tested stone material. In fact, in previous works, it has been demonstrated that by placing a planar resonator in contact with the considered stone sample, it is possible to associate the resonant frequency of the resonator with the moisture content of the stone sample, through reflection scattering parameter measurements. In previous studies, however, the level of applied pressure is not standardized and controlled. An application of an external force could improve the repeatability and increase the detectability of the first resonance peak. The current study shows a negligible resonant frequency shift among measurements with different applied pressures at the same water content θv level, but a significant change regarding Q factor. Moreover, applying an external force on the patch, the first resonance peak can be identified more easily, thanks to an increase in the Q factor.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089732","Cultural Heritage;Dielectric permittivity;Moisture content measurements;Patch resonator;Stones","Resonant frequency;Frequency measurement;Moisture;Force;Q-factor;Permittivity;Moisture measurement","history;materials testing;moisture measurement;pressure measurement;pressure sensors;resonators;S-parameters","cultural heritage stone materials;reflection scattering parameter measurements;reflection coefficient;moisture level measurements;planar patch resonator-based measurements;stone material testing","","2","","22","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The relative simplicity of the measurement principle and the inherent adaptability to diverse operating conditions are two of the most notable features of these techniques. In spite of these specific advantages, however, there are still some aspects that hinder the widespread use of permittivity-based moisture content measurement systems, and make their standardization difficult. In particular, the density of the sample under test may affect the estimation of permittivity, thus possibly leading to inaccurate moisture content measurements. As a result, the measurement system should be re-calibrated even when the same type of material is being investigated (e.g., two samples of the same type of stone, but extracted from different quarries).To circumvent this problem and to fully exploit the potential of permittivity-based moisture content measurements, in this work, a strategy for compensating for the effect of density is addressed. In order to verify the suitability of this strategy, moisture content measurements were carried out on samples of two type of stones typical of historic masonry, namely gentile stone and red-clay brick.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.9089804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089804","Cultural Heritage;dielectric permittivity;historic masonry materials;moisture content measurements;scattering parameters;stones;vector network analyzer","Moisture;Permittivity measurement;Moisture measurement;Calibration;Permittivity;Dielectrics","building materials;calibration;measurement standards;moisture measurement;permittivity measurement","historic masonry materials;density effect compensation;dielectric permittivity-based moisture content measurement techniques;calibration;gentile stone;red-clay brick","","","","18","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The experimental results showed that both devices have significant problems. Perception neuron had position errors and accumulated errors though it was calibrated before measurements. The frame rate and the resolution for depth sensing of Kinect v2 could not sufficient record the sword motions. On the other hand, a visible camera that can capture 240 frames per a second reduced the number of missing frames by recording sword motions.

Five 3D models of the point were taken over the period of ten years, two before and three after the conservation process. The comparison of the 3D models serves two purposes. The primary goal is to evaluate the changes of the artifact that occurred during this period and, specifically, to compare its shape before and after the treatment. Conservation of waterlogged wood is still a delicate and somewhat uncertain process in regards to the long term survivability of such artifacts.

The primary objectives of the study were to provide a valid and high-resolution mapping of the root systems belonging to different species of matured trees, as well as to investigate areas of roots interconnection. To this effect, a data processing methodology based on three main stages was developed. A pre-processing algorithm was first proposed to remove noise-related information from the raw data and to improve deep reflections from attenuated targets. Afterwards, an algorithm was developed for target identification (i.e. the vertices of the reflection hyperbolas) and their automatic tracking in a three-dimensional environment. A third stage was focused on estimating tree root density with emphasis on the interconnection area. To test the feasibility of the proposed method, the soil around two different tree species (i.e. maple and ash trees) was surveyed using a ground-coupled GPR system equipped with a 700 MHz central frequency antenna. The approach has proven to identify peculiar characteristics of both trees, in terms of surface (i.e. within the first 25 cm from the soil surface) and deep (i.e. deeper than 25 cm from the soil surface) root systems. In addition, results have allowed to assess how different root systems interact with each other.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089763","ground penetrating radar (GPR);tree health monitoring;tree roots detection;tree roots interconnection;data processing methodology","Vegetation;Ground penetrating radar;Signal processing algorithms;Soil;Data processing;Reflection;Distance measurement","geophysical image processing;ground penetrating radar;radar antennas;radar imaging;radar tracking;soil;UHF antennas;vegetation","ground penetrating radar;tree root systems;high-resolution mapping;matured trees;roots interconnection;data processing methodology;preprocessing algorithm;noise-related information;deep reflections;attenuated targets;target identification;reflection hyperbolas;interconnection area;ash trees;ground-coupled GPR system;soil surface;maple trees;tree root density estimation;matured tree species;automatic tracking;three-dimensional environment;UHF antenna;frequency 700.0 MHz","","4","","22","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we present the preliminary results of a recent application of micro-geophysical (both by contact and remote sensing) techniques to typical architectural targets such as paint surfaces and stone walls. First, a multispectral survey test has been carried on looking at sample areas of a paint vault with low-cost tools to recognize possible painting layering and pigments gathering. The second target was a vertical profile of a stone pillar, studied by means of very high-resolution and miniaturized geophysical techniques, such as monostatic and bistatic high-frequency georadar (GPR) prospecting and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT, surface and cross-wall configurations). Cross-wall acquisitions (ERT and GPR) were carried out to validate the potential of simpler acquisitions performed from only one side of the investigated wall. This was done in order to check the applicability of the overall procedure to even higher value and sensitive surfaces of historical architectural assets. By means of these micro-geophysical methods we were able to recognize possible discontinuities due to masonry layout and changes in physical properties probably due to moisture presence inside the stonework.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089753","Historical architecture;cultural heritage diagnostics;geophysics;GPR;ERT;multispectral remote sensing","Electrodes;Cultural differences;Ground penetrating radar;Tomography;Remote sensing;Geophysical measurements;Two dimensional displays","building materials;design engineering;ground penetrating radar;nondestructive testing;structural engineering;walls","nondestructive diagnostics;architectonic elements;artefact knowledge;historical built heritage;low-invasive diagnostics;remote sensing;paint surfaces;stone walls;multispectral survey test;paint vault;stone pillar;miniaturized geophysical techniques;electrical resistivity tomography;cross-wall configurations;cross-wall acquisitions;historical architectural assets;painting layering","","8","","29","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of this study is to realize a small-size and low-cost sensor system able to evaluate and classify the effects of different factors in an original way: through a global Risk Index. The proposed and projected system allows monitoring: (a) daily thermal variations; (b) the vibrations that occur on the structure and (c) pollutant - both reductant, oxidant and depositing agents. In this paper, the structure (hardware and software) of the environmental monitoring device is presented and expounded in detail. A Risk Analysis Algorithm is proposed and evaluated.

The analysis allowed us to not only identify the materials constituting the coffin, and its state of conservation, but also to correctly plan the conservation treatment. The results of C14 analysis confirmed the dating of the coffin to the Ptolemaic period, while the optical microscope and SEM identified both the genus and the species of wood used for the boards and the joints. We also determined the components of the ground layer and the painted layer through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis; in particular we observed that the wig of the coffin wasn’t black, as reported in the catalogue [1], but it was actually painted with Egyptian blue. We also analyzed the thicknesses of the different layers through stratigraphic analysis and Dino-lite photos. The UV light allowed us to highlight the lack of varnish, and to reveal traces of previous restoration works, especially on the gilded mask. Finally, a conservation treatment has been carried out on the coffin: the surface has been disinfestated and consolidated, the wig has been cleaned and the missing parts of the ground layer have been integrated along the joining lines of the boards.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089741","polychrome wooden coffin;pigments;Egyptian Blue;wood identification;archaeometric analysis","Pigments;Scanning electron microscopy;Optical microscopy;Paints;Iron;Fluorescence","","","","","","8","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, especially if the monument to be investigated is a large building, many devices are necessary. In order to face all these difficulties, we propose the recently developed motion magnification methodology. It is based on a processing procedure that plays the role of a microscope for slight motions within a video. In recent years, experimental studies explored this methodology applied to simple geometries, demonstrating its potentialities and reliability thorough comparison with conventional and accurate vibration instruments, such as accelerometers and lasers.

The integration of SHM systems into historical constructions is a very complex problem due to the heterogeneity of the raw materials, the geometric complexity of the building, the need of the simultaneous monitoring of many parts. Because to the complexity of the structures under monitoring, SHM system based on Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm can be a solution. IoT paradigm permits to spread heterogeneous sensors all over and each of them is able to acquire and elaborate data. Further interesting aspect is the managing of such data with genetic algorithm to identify the damage and the variation of the engineering constants. However, in the case of masonry historical constructions such algorithms could fail due to the complexity of the structures. Aim of this work is to overcome this problem by identifying the structural elements introducing high complexity and then causing the fail of the monitoring system and to propose their substitution with low complex equivalent models.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.9089776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089776","Structural Health Monitoring;Intent of Things;Masonry Structures;Finite Element Model","Monitoring;Springs;Sensors;Internet of Things;Complexity theory;Buildings;Finite element analysis","building materials;condition monitoring;Internet of Things;structural engineering computing","structural health monitoring system;SHM system;geometric complexity;simultaneous monitoring;Internet of Things paradigm","","","","38","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This being a somehow recent development, a strong, efficient link between these institutions and the research field still largely needs to be established, as well as a true bi-directional dialogue that aligns the efforts and the focus of these institutions to the needs of research. Equally important is the fact that neither cultural, heritage institutions nor the research field are taking full advantage of information technologies in order to improve the opportunities and the quality for research and for providing access to these collections. These two factors result in a general lack of significant research and experience in intelligent, technology-intensive, and user-engaging solutions designed to foster research on cultural digital collections across Europe.In this paper we adapt and apply a variety of recently developed techniques in the field of computer vision and machine learning in order to enrich historic media content with automatically generated metadata for faster and more efficient search in digital collections and archives.

Over the years, experienced palaeographers have devised many methodological approaches for writer identification. These methodologies are based on traditional palaeographical tools to measure quantities such as letter heights and widths, distances between characters, angles of inclination and number and types of abbreviations. Even if there has been a growing interest in the use of computer science techniques in palaeographic research, there is no general consensus about the effectiveness of such techniques and the main problems in this research field are very far to be solved in the general case. In the context of highly standardized handwriting, the use of some basic features related to the page layout can be very helpful for automatically distinguishing different scribal hands. These features have the advantage of being easily extracted using standard image processing algorithms. In this paper we present a classification tool for helping the palaeographer's work, based on basic layout measures taking into account some general properties related to the organization of the whole page (such as margins, distance between columns, etc.), and some specific properties characterizing the ability of the writer to exploit the available space and to distribute the text in each row. The experimental results, performed on two sets of digital images of two whole Bibles of the XII century, show that using only few pages of these ancient documents for the training phase of the classifier, it is possible to automatically identify the writers on the remaining pages.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089802","Digital Palaeography;Classification Algorithms;Writer Identification","Feature extraction;Training;Layout;Writing;Tools;Task analysis;Computer science","document image processing;feature extraction;handwriting recognition;handwritten character recognition;history;image classification;text analysis","classification tool;basic layout measures;ancient documents;automatic writer identification;medieval books;palaeography;experienced palaeographers;computer science techniques;palaeographic research;general consensus;highly standardized handwriting;page layout;scribal hands;standard image processing algorithms;palaeographical tools;digital images;writer hand identification","","","","28","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The procedure is applied in the city of Cagliari, Italy, in the area of the ancient walls between the bastion of Santa Croce and the fourteenth-century Elephant Tower. This sector consists of the curtain of Santa Chiara, designed in 1575 and completed in the years 1576-1578 by the military engineer Giorgio Paleari. The archival documents offer precise indications on the collapses and the reconstructions/expansions that took place in that period, so facilitating a recognition of the events. Compared to the medieval walls, the work of Paleari brought forward the line of defense by means of a robust embankment and incorporated two of the fifteenth-century towers described in the drawings of the military engineers of the time. In the eighteenth century, the front was completed with the construction of a lowered embankment leaning against the southern side of the bastion of Santa Croce and the curtain of Santa Chiara. More recently, both the bastion and the sixteenth century curtain have been reinforced by means of several restoration and consolidation works. The latter changed the profile of the parapet –in the origin it was inclined-and the static balance of the constructive system by means of reinforced concrete piles. The survey methods and techniques used in this study provide interesting information about the current structure of the bastion system, such as the presence of vaulted passages functional to the military work. A further study campaign mainly based on seismic tomography techniques is proposed.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089758","digital survey;geophysical investigations;military architecture;Cagliari","Tomography;Graphics;Documentation;Receivers;Urban areas;Cultural differences;Poles and towers","foundations;geophysical techniques;geotechnical structures;history;poles and towers;reinforced concrete;seismology;structural engineering;walls","military architecture;urban context;digital representations;geophysical surveys;Cagliari;multidisciplinary study;digital surveys;geophysical investigations;ancient walls;Santa Croce;fourteenth-century Elephant Tower;Santa Chiara;military engineer Giorgio Paleari;archival documents;medieval walls;consolidation works;constructive system;reinforced concrete piles;survey methods;bastion system","","6","","8","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, several scholars have found examples of parametric thinking from the origin of the history of Western architecture.

However, this approach is based on the hypothesis that large amount of labeled data are available. To overcome this drawback, transfer learning techniques have been proposed. These techniques use parts of large deep networks, learned by using very large image datasets, as starting points for the learning of networks to solve a more specific classification problem. In this paper, we present a deep transfer learning based tool to help paleographers in identifying the parts of a manuscript that were written by the same writer.

On the other, their knowledge and accurate documentation is urgent. Even if there are several acquisition techniques for each scale of representation, there is not still the winning solution for every condition; the consequence is that most of the surveying projects related to large and complex sites integrate multiple sensors and techniques [1]. Towards this direction, producers are introducing in the market sophisticated tools which integrates multiple sensors in an ”all in one solution” that in the literature are defined as combination of methods. One of them, recently introduced, is the SLAM (Simultaneously Localization and Mapping) technology, that has introduced a new system to acquire millions of 3D points in a short time and with good accuracy also in indoor location. In this light, the work that will be described in the article deals with the comparison of dense point clouds obtained with different acquisition techniques (namely TLS and Mobile Mapping), using as a case study a Roman Amphitheater, since, given its complexity, represents a challenging benchmark for such study. For a more detailed documentation of the site and to cope with the lack of imagery information from these latter techniques, a drone flight was performed. The main contributions of the article are: i) testing in a real case scenario a novel tool which integrates different sensors, assessing its suitability for archaeological settings; ii) validating its accuracy w.r.t. other well established techniques; iii) performing the complete mapping of an important archaeological sites, combining terrestrial and aerial acquisition techniques.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089765","SLAM;UAV;Integration;Archaeology;Fast and Agile acquisition techniques","Three-dimensional displays;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Documentation;Cloud computing;Tools;Cultural differences","archaeology;autonomous aerial vehicles;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;history;image reconstruction;mobile robots;optical scanners;remote sensing;robot vision;sensor fusion;SLAM (robots);solid modelling","slam-based mobile mapping system;3D heritage scene real-time reconstruction;surveying techniques;cultural heritage data;multiple sensors;indoor location;dense point clouds;archaeological sites;terrestrial acquisition techniques;aerial acquisition techniques;simultaneously localization and mapping technology;drone flight;autonomous aerial vehicles","","2","","17","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the first steps to obtain digital mosaics is the segmentation process to separate (identify) tesserae. Then, various tools are necessary to catalog the digitalized scenes, to extract the figures, such as animal or human beings, from the puzzle of small pieces, to geolocalize the segmented objects and to assign a semantic meaning to them. While some mosaic segmentation approaches have already been reported in the literature, currently, mosaic segmentation is still done by human operators, resulting time consuming and error prone. We propose in this paper an automatic approach, based on Deep Learning, to segment the mosaic floor tesserae of the church of S. Stephen in Umm ar Rasas. Our approach allows to obtain automatically and with good reliability the description of the main elements of a mosaic (the tesserae) that are not homogeneous. The experiments performed on the collected tesserae dataset yield high accuracies and demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of our approach.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089746","Segmentation;Cultural Heritage;Mosaic;Feature Extraction;Deep learning;Image processing","Image segmentation;Machine learning;Semantics;Image color analysis;Art;Image restoration;Urban areas","history;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence)","automatic mosaic digitalization;tessera segmentation;coloured tiles;called tesserae;decorative art;digital mosaics;segmentation process;digitalized scenes;semantic meaning;mosaic segmentation approaches;deep learning;mosaic floor tesserae;the tesserae;collected tesserae dataset","","2","","17","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The GIS was born as tool for the knowledge and management of spatial data used in small-scale representation. However, since the first applications it became necessary to use the GIS also in large-scale representation for architectural analysis: in this field, the instrument presented significant limitations especially in the 3D editing processing. Nevertheless, the great potential of GIS, given by an unlimited and continuously updated database suggested to develop a new tool for the architectural approach named BIM. The criterion is the same: both the systems are based on the geo-referencing of the real objects and on the possibility of joining the database with a cartographic or architectural graphic model. Currently, GIS and BIM are being used separately: the first widely deals with to improve the safety and efficiency of urban structures and infrastructures and to analyze the environmental data and the natural risks; the second one is being employed in the design of new buildings and infrastructures. The simultaneous use of both the systems is nowadays fundamental for instance for the management of smart cities or historical towns; the informative digital model of cities, that includes both land and building data, would indeed be very useful. This contribution describes the integration between BIM and GIS exploiting the interoperability of the systems ensured by some software as Autodesk InfraWorks. The paper highlights in fact the importance of such integration especially in the fields of decision making and management of “land” and buildings data.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.13625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089761","GIS;BIM;integration;interoperability;urban heritage","Mechanical engineering;Geographic information systems;Metrology;Cultural differences;Interoperability;Information systems;Buildings","building information modelling;computer graphics;database management systems;decision making;geographic information systems;open systems","architectural graphic model;buildings data;integrated BIM-GIS system;small-scale representation;large-scale representation;database;urban heritage;decision making;Autodesk InfraWorks;interoperability;environmental data;cartographic graphic model;geo-referencing;3D editing processing","","1","","21","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed filtering framework is based on a novel concept of closeness between a sample from a processing block and the local neighborhood (patch) of the pixel, which is being restored. The dissimilarity measure is defined as a sum of squared distances to the most similar pixels of a patch centered at the processed pixel. The filter output is a weighted average of samples from the filtering block and the similarities to the central patch are used as weighting coefficients. To increase the filter robustness, the impulsiveness of pixels in the processing block is also taken into account, which significantly improves the filtering performance.The novel technique has been compared with the widely used filtering methods and the performed experiments proved its satisfying smoothing properties. The new filter is insensitive to outliers introduced by the impulsive noise process, enhances image edges and preserves details, while efficiently suppressing the Gaussian noise component.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.9089837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089837","","Image restoration;Noise reduction;Gaussian noise;Image color analysis;Pollution measurement;Robustness;Roads","edge detection;Gaussian noise;image colour analysis;image denoising;image enhancement;image filtering;impulse noise;smoothing methods","color images;filtering framework;processing block;local neighborhood;dissimilarity measure;sum of squared distances;filter output;filtering block;central patch;weighting coefficients;filter robustness;filtering performance improvement;filtering methods;impulsive noise process;image edge enhancement;Gaussian noise component;robust denoising technique;mixed Gaussian impulsive noise suppression;smoothing properties","","","","32","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding the inscriptions is important in terms of researching world history, character evaluations, and more. This work introduces a state-of-art initiative to recognize oracle bone inscriptions by deep learning. This is the first time an oracle bone inscription dataset featuring real rubbing images has been generated. For training before recognition, we augment the inscription images by means of rotation, Gaussian noise addition, cutting, brightness changing and inversion, which turns one image into 3,072 new images. We change the dropout, layer number, and filter number of every layer, so as to improve recognition ability and achieve a prefect recognition rate. By analyzing the mistaken recognitions, we identify some special characters that should be given special data augmentation. In an experiment using 184 difference characters and a dataset consisting of 2,000 images including 538 test images, parameter tuning and data augmentation resulted in the recognition rate of 92.3%, and the training data was augmented into 9.69 million items.","","978-1-5386-5276-3","10.1109/MetroArchaeo43810.2018.9089769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089769","Deep learning;Data augmentation;Parameter tuning;Oracle bone inscriptions recognition","Image recognition;Machine learning;Bones;Brightness;Training;Gaussian noise;Feature extraction","bone;character recognition;feature extraction;Gaussian noise;image enhancement;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence)","parameter tuning;Gaussian noise addition;real rubbing images;aging process;turtle shells;oracle bone inscription recognition;inscription images;oracle bone inscription dataset;cattle bone;data augmentation;deep learning","","6","","13","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This of course greatly helps the public and the industry in accelerating the process of the SKP by DKP NTT spending for them. Using the waterfall method, registration and recapitulation of SKP application Web-based at DKP NTT is created using the Bootstrap framework that is responsive design so that it allows the web to adjust the screen size of the devices used by web visitors. This helps the public and industry who register using smartphones or tablets owned by them without having to come directly to the DKP NTT office to do the registration and propose of the UPI. The results of the analysis illustrate that there has been a decline in the number of people and industries that come directly to the DKP NTT office in a month, which is around 91.3%, while the number of callers asking about information about UPI and SKP has also decreased by 82%, then for those who communicate and consult via email also decreased by 74%. In addition, the effectiveness of the use of time in the DKP NTT office is also better because there has been a decrease in the estimated time needed. The existence of this website in addition to facilitating DKP NTT employees in conducting recapitulation of all UPI and SKP data, but also accelerating the process of granting certificates to the public and industry. In the registration process, which was previously done through conventional data filling through the registration form provided, it has now decreased the estimated time required for the registration process, which is 84%, then a decrease in time estimation also occurs in the registration and UPI process which is 93.4%.

Most outdoor high voltage insulator installed in Indonesia were made of porcelain with certain electric property such as surface conductivity, Basic Insulation Level (BIL) value, and wet/dry flashover voltage. Therefore, the surface of the insulator must be kept clean during operation period to maintain the electric property. Higher industrial development gives higher environment pollution exposure toward insulator installed nearby the industrial area. This paper described the effect of industrial pollution exposure toward the breakdown of the porcelain insulator through Hardness testing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) testing, and Ambient air quality testing. Also, the recommendation for maintenance insulator in industrial area has been proposed. Ambient air quality result showed that very high Total Suspended Material (TSP) in the environment where the insulator installed. This pollutant is then recognized as iron material and the SEM result showed that this pollutant stick to the surface of the damaged insulator. Iron pollution exposure created conductive layer on the surface of the insulator that decrease the insulation capability of the insulator. Therefore, the insulator would be breakdown due to the flow of power arc under overvoltage stress during lightning strike. For insulator located in industrial area, it's recommended to perform frequent cleaning by using appropriate method as stated in standard.","","978-1-5386-7725-4","10.1109/BICAME45512.2018.1570505929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9084528","Insulators;pollutant;environment;hardness testing;SEM testing;ambient air quality testing;flashover","Insulators;Surface contamination;Sea surface;Scanning electron microscopy;Surface resistance;Surface treatment;Porcelain","air pollution;conductors (electric);earthing;insulator testing;lightning;maintenance engineering;poles and towers;porcelain insulators;scanning electron microscopy","transmission tower;lightning strike;power arc flow;TSP;total suspended material;ambient air quality testing;SEM testing;scanning electron microscopy testing;environment pollution exposure;Indonesia;grounded structure;conductor;power system transmission insulators performance;high voltage equipment insulator;air pollution;maintenance insulator;porcelain insulator;industrial pollution exposure;electric property;voltage 150.0 kV","","","","8","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Humans will never be separated from the needs of electricity in daily activities. Electrical energy is used in household activities, offices, industry, and others. It is well known that there are still many countries that use fossil fuels as their primary energy source, which is non-renewable energy. One hope of the source of electrical energy is alternative energy, such as biofuel, solar, wind, ocean waves, ocean currents, ups and downs, to plants. Therefore, it is expected that the world can apply renewable energy in the form of Plant Microbial Fuel Cell or better known as Plant Microbial Fuel Cell, which utilizes the plant's natural bacteria to produce electricity. Currently the development of Plant Microbial Fuel Cell is still focused on the type of grass and paddy fields that has fiber roots. Research on the type of root plant fibers showed good results so that will be developed into the type of rooted riding plants that have a longer life power such as pucuk merah (Syzygium oleina). Electrodes used there are two types, magnesium-carbon and magnesium-copper. Both electrodes generated the maximum power 1,963.005 mW and 2,953.104 mW respectively, were obtained in the first day by measured current and voltage.

The development of this model is intended to predict the potency of flood peak based on certain rainfall inputs in the watershed system, especially in an unmeasured watershed or measured watersheds with insufficient data. The high deviation that resulted from previous similar models had low performance in the tested watershed, also the reason this SUH model was developed. The main properties of this model are the accommodation of fractal parameters of the watershed, especially in peak time equations and a very simple single curve equation derived from the two-parameter Gamma Distribution. This paper intends to introduce the ITS-2 Model to estimate flood hydrographs in various watersheds in Indonesia. By introducing this model, it is expected to be able to obtain information from various users in Indonesia regarding the performance and validity of the model, so that improvements can be made in the future. Application in one watershed on the Island of Borneo, namely the Upper Telen Watershed in East Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, proves that this model shows a fairly good performance with a relatively low root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (r) above 80%. However, testing on watersheds in various regions in Indonesia needs to be applied continuously to determine the reliability of the model.","","978-1-5386-7725-4","10.1109/BICAME45512.2018.1570489773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9084614","hydrology model;rainfall-runoff;flood prediction;fractal characteristics;tropical watershed","Mathematical model;Floods;Predictive models;Data models;Discharges (electric);Rivers","floods;fractals;hydrological techniques;rain;water resources","Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember;flood peak;watershed system;unmeasured watershed;measured watersheds;tested watershed;peak time equations;simple single curve equation;two-parameter Gamma Distribution;ITS-2 Model;flood hydrographs;Indonesia;Upper Telen Watershed;correlation coefficient;flood forecasting Model;synthetic unit hydrograph model;AD 2017;rainfall inputs;SUH model;fractal parameters;Island of Borneo;east Kalimantan Province","","1","","21","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dimensions of the turbine; inlet diameter D0 = 4 meter and impeller diameter D1 = 1.5 meter and outlet diameter = 2.60 meter. At the speed stated above, hydraulic force obtained reached 324 kW. Optimization of turbine output parameters is carried out through structural modification and cross-view geometrical modification. Turbine meridian cross view section is modified to be streamlined. In this case, cross view modification by adapting ducted-turbine that is carried out without changing the inlet dimension. Flow velocity was measured at three turbine sections, namely at the inlet section, the impeller housing section and the outlet section. Rate of meridian flow is measured at three meridian positions, which are Vo at the inlet, V1 at the impeller and V2 at the outlet. Output parameters are calculated based on the water velocity and the data measured at the three corresponding sections. The maximum power coefficient was found to be 0.593 that occurs at the induction factor value of a = 0.346 and the maximum thrust coefficient of CT = 1 was found at the induction factor value of a = 1.

Various hardware and software design techniques are adopted to guarantee node reliability and availability. This paper exclusively discusses hardware design to increase the availability of a node by using the failover scenario when power loss occurred. The node architecture is modified using additional second processors and uses one shared RF transceiver. The second processor, as a backup of the first processor, wakes up only when the first processor off or fails due to power loss or needs maintenance.

In the military field, one of the AUV applications is a torpedo. A torpedo has a mission to go to a given target, frequently a moving target. To meet this objective, the torpedo must have a detection system to find out the target position. However, it is impossible to be implemented because of the limited space and energy available in a torpedo. Therefore, it requires a reliable system to predict a moving target, to form the path to hit the target, avoid obstacles in the path, and the controller that can follow the path determined by the path planning algorithm. Therefore, this study developed various scenarios to simulate the conditions. The results show that the radial base function network can form a path that is free from obstacles and able to form a path that can intercept a moving target while the state-dependent LQT algorithm is able to perform a path tracking properly so that the AUV can reach a predetermined target. With the speed of 1.4 m/s, the AUV could intercept a moving target with the speed of 0.2 m/s and the face angle of -1.7 radians at t = 75.1 seconds.

With the study of remote sensing technology, it is expected to provide fast and accurate information to the Regional Government regarding the consequences of mining activities and directions for mitigation. Landsat-7 satellite image technology and GIS-based Thematic Maps can provide land cover information on the impact of mining activities quickly, but must be supported by the accuracy and data validation resulting from the field visits.Based on these data it can be seen that the exploitation of limestone mining can affect the area of critical land and cause environmental damage, with illustration in the extent of the negative impact from exploitation that has been done. Using the spatio-temporal (analysis) approach, it can be seen how much the forest changes in limestone mining activities for the period 2012-2017 on Kendeng Mountain, Blora - Rembang Regency in relation to the above mentioned features. Spatio-temporal analysis is a method of combining analysis between spatial and multi-time analysis.","","978-1-5386-7725-4","10.1109/BICAME45512.2018.1570495527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9084608","limestone mining;remote sensing;geographic information system","","geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;minerals;mining;remote sensing","multitime analysis;remote sensing monitoring;limestone mining exploitation;Mountain Kendeng;store natural resources;Kendeng Mountain;mining area;systematic image data;remote sensing technology;environmental conditions;data collection;raster data;textual processing;image analysis;GIS-based Thematic Maps;land cover information;spatio-temporal approach;limestone mining activities;spatio-temporal analysis;Blora-Rembang Regency;Landsat-7 satellite image technology","","","","8","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increasing annual load every year, it is necessary to estimate the demand of electrical energy for a balance exists between the energy required by customers and the distributed electricity to the network to reduce the loss rate and provide customers satisfaction. This paper will discuss the forecasting of electrical energy consumption for each sector (household, business, industrial, and public) based on macroeconomic factors those are population, gross regional domestic product (GRDP), and inflation. Furthermore, based on the required energy consumption, the connected power grid must be calculated on the network. The method is a multiple linear regression method with population, GRDP, and inflation as the independent variables and electrical energy consumption as a dependent variable. The result of this study indicates that in the year of 2018 to 2029, the electrical energy consumption of each sector shows a relatively constant increase with the highest consumption in the household sector. In addition, using the IEEE standard of load factor (0,6-0,8), the total power grid capacity required on the network in 2029 is 414,99 MVA which at the end of 2017 totally power grid connected to the network is only 341,04 MVA.

Furthermore, filters are made using two different types of materials, namely natural and artificial dielectrics. In natural dielectric resonators, distance and thickness measurements are carried out to yield definite data. This data then becomes a reference for making artificial dielectric resonators. The best frequency response for this simulation is at thickness of 3.2 mm and distance of 6 mm. The artificial dielectric resonators are made by adding conductors with certain patch shapes on the natural dielectric surface. The frequency response of the filter is unsatisfactory due to there is a damping. Therefore, the distance of connectors is closer to each other to eliminate the damping.

The measured air quality is determined by the concentration of O2, CO, CO2 and NH3 gases at multiple measuring points in the classroom. The gas sensor is controlled by Arduino as a processor equipped with a wifi module and a real time clock (RTC). Sensor nodes are activated for 2 minutes to measure and send data and then put to sleep for 5 minutes. This operating mode consumes energy of 3,410 mWh or 42% less than full time operating mode. Data acquisition by each sensor node will be sent to the server using the HTTP protocol and displayed on web pages that can be accessed via the internet in real time.

The precise and accurate level of predicting the start of the season will certainly greatly assist various community activities in multiple sectors such as transportation, agriculture, forestry, health, public works, and others. SST controls the ability of the oceans to regulate heating and to regulate water distribution. The condition of local SST can be used as an indicator of the minimum amount of moisture in the atmosphere and is closely related to cloud formation in Indonesia. If the cold SST supply of water vapor in the atmosphere will be reduced, on the contrary, if the SST is warmer than average then the water vapor in the atmosphere will tend to be more. The warmer or hotter the sea surface temperature, the higher the availability of water vapor which causes cloud formation and of course the atmospheric conditions will become more humid. Time series data is a group of observations obtained at different time points with the same time interval, and the data sequence is assumed to be interconnected with each other. In this paper, we analyze the rainfall data in Sulawesi, which begins with the formation of spatial correlation and uses modified generalized regression neural network method to forecast.

The proposed model evaluates the toxic cloud concentrations in terms of probability values and then the exit route of each occupant is computed such that the toxic effect on the occupants is minimized. We integrated A* search algorithm with the toxic cloud model to find the safest routes for occupants to exit through the doors from the current positions of the occupants. To find the best route, the model considers the distance to egress, the obstacles and the probability of toxic concentration. We presented the simulation results of the model to demonstrate the plausibility of the model.

The system described in this paper utilizes a proven fast load shed system and makes it easy to configure larger and more complex load shed schemes. The paper proposes the architecture of a central fast load shed controller interfaced with local feeder protection relays over IEC 61850 GOOSE and additional fast load shed aggregators if total GOOSE is more than 64.

In 2-pole motors there are two main sources of vibration: rotor unbalance and electrical twice-line frequency excitation. Low vibration implies that the natural frequencies of the motor are separated from the corresponding excitation frequencies. Usually, if the site foundation is rigid, the vibration levels repeat the FAT values with minor changes and are well within the initial limits for condition monitoring. However, if the foundation is flexible, the motor vibration may produce unexpected results. The aim of this paper is to introduce a procedure to help ensure low vibration on site conditions in these cases. The procedure relies on the early cooperation between the motor manufacturer and system integrator based on the horizontal and vertical stiffness of the foundation. The most cost-effective solution can be reached by incorporating proper motor design features in conjunction with the design of the mounting base.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080434","Electric motors;Mechanical engineering;Vibrations;Prediction methods;Flexible foundation","","condition monitoring;dynamic testing;electric motors;foundations;rigidity;rotors;vibrations","2-pole motors;flexible foundation;motor vibration;natural frequencies;motor design features;factory acceptance testing;rotor unbalance;electrical twice-line frequency excitation;excitation frequencies;rigidity;FAT values;condition monitoring;horizontal stiffness;vertical stiffness;mounting base design","","","","14","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A path is required for the ground fault current to flow and an understanding of the path is better realized with the use of symmetrical components and the use of the zero sequence plane. Next, the paper will present a brief discussion on the use of a standard six-pulse rectifier which is commonly used on small, low and medium voltage drives. Using the basic understanding of the HRG system and the ASD, the flow of ground current from the load side of the ASD to the power system is shown.

As the latest technology, they are being touted as a better choice than the various forms of passive harmonic mitigation solutions presently available. Is this actually the case? Active solutions incorporate switching strategies using IGBTs in order to make the current drawn by the adjustable speed drive, or other nonlinear load, more sinusoidal. What you will rarely hear from manufacturers is that this switching introduces higher frequency harmonics, normally above the 50th. When measurements are taken up to the 50th. current total harmonic distortion (ITHD) is often quite low but when measured up to the 100th or higher, ITHD almost always exceeds their claimed performance levels which consider only harmonics up to the 50th. This is certainly a concern because higher frequency harmonics are more likely to cause power system problems and issues with other connected loads, than the lower frequency harmonics that they are designed to reduce. Although there are IEEE and IEC industry standards that restrict levels of harmonics in the low frequency and very high frequency ranges, there are no standards presently that address the range between 2 kHz and 150 kHz. Manufacturers therefore, often design active harmonic mitigation equipment that generates relatively high levels of these mid-range frequencies, particularly since switching frequencies of IGBTs typically fall precisely within this range.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080481","Active Power Filters (APF);Active Harmonic Filters (AHF);Active Front End Drives (AFE);Wide Spectrum Harmonic Filter (WSHF);harmonics;variable speed drive;supraharmonics","","harmonic distortion;IEC standards;IEEE standards;insulated gate bipolar transistors;power harmonic filters;power system harmonics;variable speed drives","IEC industry standards;IEEE standards;nonlinear load;IGBT;switching frequencies;active harmonic mitigation equipment;power system problems;ITHD;current total harmonic distortion;frequency harmonics;adjustable speed drive;passive harmonic mitigation solutions;frequency 2.0 kHz to 150.0 kHz","","","","45","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

International and North American requirements for cables and cable glands will be examined and compared. In North America, the National Electrical Code (NEC) and Canadian Electrical Code, Part I (CEC) define the requirements for the types of cable that are permitted to be used in different hazardous (classified) locations. In North America, standards exist for certifying cables for use in hazardous locations. These standards have now evolved to allow for additional cable types beyond metal clad (MC) and TECK 90 cables that are primarily used. In Canada, a new edition (2018) of the Hazardous Location Cable and Cable Gland standard has been published, and this should help to clarify the intended range of cable types that could potentially be approved for hazardous locations in Canada. In the United States (US), the NEC defines the types of cables that can be used in hazardous locations, and UL 2225 provides the means to approve Hazardous Location (HL) cables for the US. The International Electro-Technical Commission (IEC) on the other hand does not require cables to be specifically approved for explosive gas or dust atmospheres and instead only provides guidance within IEC 60079-14 on the selection of cables. In all jurisdictions, cable glands for use in explosive gas atmospheres are required to be approved for the location they are being installed in or with a method of protection suitable for the location that they are being installed in, but there are differences in the various standards and requirements.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080463","hazardous locations;explosive atmospheres;cables;cable glands;hazloc;installation","","cables (electric);certification;electrical safety;explosions;IEC standards;standards","explosive gas atmospheres;North America;TECK 90 cables;hazardous location cable;cable gland standard;International Electro-Technical Commission;certification","","","","22","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a time-correlated PD measurement acquired through an array of radio frequency antennas within medium voltage bus ducting of various designs. The research presented artificially recreates faults experienced in the field, created in laboratory environment under controlled conditions on medium voltage bus duct. A comparison of varying types of PD will be introduced and a technique developed to automatically detect and pinpoint the position based on the time delay of the measured RF signal as measured through tuned antennas.

System development and commissioning was complicated because of the multiple inertia models imposed by dissimilar generators. The primary controls (governor and automatic voltage regulators) are set to frequency-droop and voltage-droop modes under normal operating conditions. However, isochronous load sharing lines are also present between the turbine- and engine-driven generators as a manufacturer backup control strategy in the event of GCS control loss. The GCS needed to be adaptive to operate in parallel with a second control system for the turbine-driven generator. Another challenge was simultaneous regulation of bus voltage and kVAR load sharing between the generators.

There are additional requirements for drives applied to MV induction motors utilized for “down hole” electric submersible pumps applications. The need for these additional requirements is driven by both function and application; motors are separated by distances measured in km from the drive. Drives should be selected to accept feedback from downhole pump measurements and programmed to provide additional protective features such lack of cooling, inferred from undercurrent and “rock start” to facilitate starting when the pump assembly is obstructed. The km distances between the drive and the motor amplify the significance of a variety of issues that may exist in drive/motor systems where the distances are more moderate. Some of these issues include voltage drop, standing waves, voltage reflections, instantaneous rate of voltage change (dv/dt), etc. Drives not only impact the performance and life of motors, experimental results demonstrate the merits of the sine wave filter with power cables of three kilometers between the drive and the pump. Drives influence the network supplying them; the impact of four different configurations for multi-pulse input rectification on the supply network is investigated with simulation and experimental analysis provided in the paper.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080438","Medium Voltage Adjustable Speed Drives;Electrical Submersible Pumps;voltage reflections","","frequency convertors;IEC standards;IEEE standards;induction motor drives;power cables;pumps;rectification","medium voltage frequency converter;ESP applications;medium voltage drives;international standards;MV induction motors;downhole pump measurements;pump assembly;down hole electric submersible pumps applications;drive-motor systems;sine wave filter;power cables;multipulse input rectification;IEC 61800 standards;IEEE 1566 standards","","","","7","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reliability can be broken down into three subcategories; availability, stability, and quality. Availability mainly pertains to the status of the primary equipment. Stability is achieved by having an effective Power Management System (PMS) to regulate voltage and frequency even during abnormal conditions (e.g. the sudden trip of a generator). Quality is a diverse topic, but the fundamental point is that the power delivered must be suitable for the loads and continuously monitored. By optimizing each of these subcategories, the reliability of the electrical power is maximized. This paper will cover technical details related to design and testing of an offshore platform PMS which uses many of the benefits of the IEC 61850 Standard, including Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging between Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and controllers to achieve fast power-based load shedding and load inhibition in a real application.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080441","IEC61850;Power Management System;GOOSE;MMS;Load Shedding;Offshore;FPS;Electrical","","IEC standards;load shedding;power supply quality;power system reliability;power system stability;substations","intelligent electronic devices;generic object oriented substation event messaging;power quality;primary equipment;system stability;load inhibition;power-based load shedding;IEC 61850 standard;offshore platform PMS;electrical power reliability;power management system","","","","2","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This was a topic of much discussion during the 2018 cycle. Committee members believe that applying the principles of human performance training will reduce the number of human errors in the workplace, and thusly, reduce the number of incidents. This makes sense, as 75% to 80% of all incidents are the result of human error. It may not be your error that is the cause of an incident. It could be an error in manufacturing that is discovered when the tool or other product injures someone. Or it could be laziness during construction or possibly a lack of knowledge on the part of the installer or designer. If a technician is called out to troubleshoot that equipment, it could cause injury due to the defect created by poor human performance. This paper will look at some of the newest industry applications of Human Performance according to NFPA 70E 2018, along with a few of the initial actions and developments (strides) taken by the companies of the authors.

One option increases the short circuit capacity (SCC) at the motor bus; the other uses a synchronous machine (SM) in lieu of an induction machine (IM). Both methods have the potential to yield higher efficiency designs with better transient ride-through capability. There are well-defined relationships between applied voltage, applied current, and output torque. In short, higher voltages and/or currents allow a rotating machine to develop more torque. For obvious reasons, this relationship becomes extremely important for the transient performance associated with direct-on-line (DOL) starting. Adding more SCC minimizes the voltage drop, yielding more efficient and less costly designs. Over the life of a typical machine (e.g. 5000 HP IM), even a relatively small efficiency improvement realizes significant savings - enough to purchase the medium voltage (MV) distribution equipment. At 10 000 HP, the efficiency gains achieved through use of a SM instead of an IM are even greater, yielding more savings. As an added benefit, the increase in SCC leads to a more stable system, allowing the motor to ride through low voltage fault conditions that might otherwise have caused a trip. This in turn means more consistent throughput and a more profitable facility.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080432","Circuit breaker interrupting time;main-tie-main (MTM);return on investment (ROI);motor efficiency;short circuit capacity (SCC)","","electric potential;fault diagnosis;machine theory;optimisation;short-circuit currents;synchronous motors;torque","MV motor optimization;short circuit capacity;SCC;motor bus;synchronous machine;transient ride-through capability;rotating machine;transient performance;direct-on-line;voltage drop;medium voltage distribution equipment;low voltage fault conditions;cost-effective AC machine;DOL;power 5000.0 hp","","","","7","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Harmonic controlled differential relays are seeing wider use for arc flash mitigation, and other harmonic-controlled schemes have also been proposed. Preliminary observations suggest that the harmonic spectra of arcing fault currents can differ substantially, which begs the question - when can harmonic-supervised protection be employed with harmonic restraints set to avoid operation for inrush while still operating quickly for arcing faults?

The paper discusses the potential for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) into an application of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for condition monitoring. The paper is a continuation of the work presented by the authors at the IEEE-PCIC 2017 conference in Calgary. The proposed asset management system analyses condition monitoring (CM) data and assesses the risk of failure data across complete HV networks. Knowledge of deteriorating asset condition provides the operator with an advanced, early warning of incipient mechanical and electrical faults. With knowledge of the severity and source of such faults, pinpointed preventative maintenance interventions can then made during planned maintenance outages. The complete HV network asset monitoring solution described includes permanent sensors and monitoring nodes deployed at strategic locations across the network. Processed data is passed via a local area network to local servers and then via secure data cloud transmission to a centralized monitoring server located at the CM headquarters. This central server operates a CM database that logs, displays, benchmarks and trends the condition data with comparison to a statistically-significant database of measurements. It is proposed in the IIoT solution proposed that this database will be downloadable to a smartphone/tablet for use by the field engineer. The monitoring technology will likely also incorporate a number of AI machine learning software modules for the de-noising of raw signals and the diagnosis of different types of defects within different types of HV plant items. The proposed SMART CM system includes an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing HV asset CM data along with operational and maintenance (O&M) data. The GUI will also be able to display both condition criticality and operational criticality (on a color-coded range of 0-100%) for individual HV plant items on a digitized mimic of the HV network's single-line diagram (SLD). This could also be combined with geometric positioning data of assets across the facility (including HV cable routes and lengths) to provide a fully digitized SMART network diagram for use in the IIoT asset management solution. Asset management data, combined with the application of the developing techniques of AI, AR and VR, will greatly help the user to visualize the plant items in 3-D, their position within the network, their condition and operational criticality along with all related asset management information together on one dashboard screen, downloaded onto smartphone/tablet. The paper concludes with a case study showing the development of a specification for a SMART IIoT asset condition monitoring solution suitable for a large petrochemical refining facility.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080444","Artificial Intelligence;AI;Augmented Reality;AR;High Voltage Motors;HV Network Condition Monitoring;Industrial Internet of Things;IIoT;Machine Learning;On-Line Partial Discharge;Virtual Reality;VR","","artificial intelligence;asset management;augmented reality;cables (electric);computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;gas industry;graphical user interfaces;maintenance engineering;petrochemicals;petroleum industry;power engineering computing;power transformer insulation;production engineering computing;switchgear insulation","smart condition monitoring system;artificial intelligence;SMART asset monitoring solution;high voltage networks;petrochemical industry;virtual reality;IEEE-PCIC 2017 conference;failure data;complete HV networks;advanced warning;early warning;incipient mechanical faults;electrical faults;pinpointed preventative maintenance interventions;planned maintenance outages;complete HV network asset monitoring solution;monitoring nodes;processed data;local area network;local servers;secure data cloud transmission;centralized monitoring server;condition data;statistically-significant database;IIoT solution;monitoring technology;AI machine learning software modules;SMART CM system;viewing HV asset CM data;condition criticality;operational criticality;individual HV plant items;HV cable routes;fully digitized SMART network diagram;IIoT asset management solution;asset management data;AI;related asset management information;SMART IIoT asset condition","","1","","12","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PCIC is an example of this culture where it has created a standalone safety entity to enhance electrical safety. Unfortunately, in industry, we continue to see significant incidents with loss of life even with this enhanced focus on safety and operations excellence. A three-legged stool is inherently stable and will not rock as a four-legged stool can, but a stool with less than three legs cannot stand. Therefore, the missing leg of the stool is reliability, which has not been a focus area of but a few end-users. In the companies that view reliability (all failures are preventable) on par with safety (all incidents are preventable) equipment failure is addressed proactively to prevent the `catastrophic failures' that has led to significant incidents in facilities. This paper will provide a context of the methods for developing a world-class reliability-centric organization.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080448","Safety;Operations Excellence;Reliability;Process Safety;Process Safety Management;Reliability Management Program;Reliability Centered Maintenance;Root Cause Analysis;Failure Modes and Effects Analysis;Preventative Maintenance;Predictive maintenance","","electrical safety;reliability","operations excellence;electrical safety;three-legged stool;four-legged stool;world-class reliability-centric organization;heavy industry;PCIC;No","","","","10","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Zone Selective Interlocking (ZSI) is a proven means of avoiding the delays of traditional Coordination Time Intervals (CTI) but interlocking of all devices within a system can raise concerns about construction and testing complications. How much of an Arc Flash benefit would it be to interlock only main and tie breakers where interlock capable communication exists for Automated Transfer Scheme (ATS) functions. To determine benefits, arc flash hazards are first reduced to the extent possible with traditional measures. Communication elements are analyzed to determine those having the speed and reliability required for protection quality interlocking. ZSI is then applied between main and tie breakers to demonstrate how the hazards of the Arc Flash hot spot can be brought under control.","2161-8127","978-1-5386-4270-2","10.1109/PCIC31437.2018.9080455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080455","Zone Interlock;Protective Device Coordination;Coordination Time Interval;ENMCS;Arc Flash","","arcs (electric);hazards;power system protection;power system reliability;power transformer protection","protective device;coordination time intervals;arc flash hazards;protection quality interlocking;transformer primary protection trip;arc flash hot spot;zone selective interlocking;ZSI;CTI;automated transfer scheme functions;ATS","","","","10","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most are started direct-on-line and run at fixed speed. When a large motor starts, the inrush current can typically reach 5 to 7 times the full load value. If the power supply grid capacity is limited, starting a large motor can produce a voltage drop that will reduce the motor accelerating torque and potentially disrupt the operation of other equipment connected to the same power grid. This paper will compare alternatives to reduce the inrush of large electric motors with focus on the design and manufacturing aspects of low inrush squirrel cage induction motors. The benefits and restrictions of the proposed solutions will be explored and a relative economic analysis will be outlined. A real case will be analyzed where a 10.8MW, 11kV, 4- pole induction motor was designed to direct-on-line start and run an offshore centrifugal compressor with starting current inrush limited to 300% of full load current.

Today, most companies have established electrical safety programs and provide arc flash training and PPE to their employees. Yet electrical injuries still occur.
