Science has not been able to prove any such sixth sense exists. Studies abound looking for the linkage between strange animal observations and a subsequent quake. But within this research, there does appear to be evidence that animals can, in fact, sense earthquakes before they occur. There is something every employee can do and every functional leader can adopt to embed cybersecurity in the daily fabric of the workplace, to bring the might of the 12 th Man to the cybersecurity field and the sixth sense of the collective herd to the first‐order fight of the digital sphere. This chapter sums up key questions and actions for every employee, manager, executive, and board member.","","9781119442165","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10014001.pdf&bkn=10013706&pdfType=chapter","","Earthquakes;Computer security;Animals;Organizations;Geology;Games;Behavioral sciences","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

They were being engulfed by an all‐out crusade; information technology (IT) departments consumed by its fury; Security caught in its crosshairs. Chief information security officers (CISOs) have a wealth of resources on best‐in‐class practices in their trade. CISOs must ensure the basics are covered and cybersecurity hygiene is at the top of that list of “things to do.” This is a case where common sense isn't always so common. Much of the conflict arises from competing objectives between cybersecurity and IT teams. IT is about keeping critical systems running and deploying technology in support of the business. Cybersecurity is about protecting the organization's assets. Artificial intelligence is the latest buzzword technology in cybersecurity.","","9781119442165","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10014007.pdf&bkn=10013706&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Visualization;Measurement;Business;Music;Fans;Computer security","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

By integrating cybersecurity concepts into tried‐and‐true design methodologies, developers play an essential role in hardening their companies'—and even their users'—cybersecurity defenses. First, in the initial phases of design, customer input is imperative. Employees notice reward and recognition in companies. It's one part of the culture that is highly visible and clearly communicates what is important to senior leadership.

In business, companies seek first‐mover advantage in launching a new product or service to capture early market share. In cybersecurity, there's no such thing as a “good offense” for a company. It seems that at least some employees think cybersecurity is better left to the tools or teams within IT, if not escalated to the higher‐ups at the company. It's understandable that a pass‐the‐buck mentality for cybersecurity is so rampant in organizations. The General Data Protection Regulation applies to all companies doing business or monitoring the activities of subjects in the European Union. According to Verizon's 2018 Data Breach Investigations Report, employees are directly or indirectly responsible for over a quarter of all breaches. Social engineering is one of the adversary's clearest weapons against naive employees.","","9781119442165","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10013968.pdf&bkn=10013706&pdfType=chapter","","Method of moments;Law enforcement;Heart;Credit cards;Computer security;Companies;Sleep","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Third‐party security management is relatively new for many organizations. CFOs carry the flag for their organizations in ensuring the procurement process sufficiently vets third parties' cybersecurity posture. In particular, the areas of the security operations center most likely to be outsourced include penetration testing, threat intelligence collection and feeds, and digital and malware forensics.

Physiological changes in ECG during the stimulus process were recorded using PSYLAB software. The paired T-test analysis was conducted to determine if there is a significant difference in driver's ECG characteristics between calm and anxious states during driving. Findings - The results show significant differences in the characteristic parameters of female driver's ECG signals, including (average heart rate), (atrioventricular interval), (percentage of NN intervals > 50ms), (R wave average peak), (Root mean square of successive), (Q wave average peak) and ( S wave average peak), in time domain, frequency domain and waveform in emotional states of calmness and anxiety. Practical implications - Findings of this work show that ECG can be used to identify driver's anxious and calm states during driving. It can be used for the development of personalized driver assistance system and driver warning system. Originality/value - Only a few attempts have been made on the influence of human emotions on physiological signals in the transportation field.

The purpose of the speed limit is to make the driver's driving behavior more consistent, so as to improve traffic safety and relieve traffic congestion. The on-road dynamic message sign (DMS) and on-board human-machine interface (HMI) are two types of warning technologies for CV-VSL systems. This study aims to analyze drivers' acceptance of the two types of warning technologies in fog area and its influencing factors. Design/methodology/approach - This study developed DMS and on-board HMI for the CV-VSL system in fog area on a driving simulator. The DMS and on-board HMI provided the driver with weather and speed limit information. In all, 38 participants participated in the experiment and completed questionnaires on drivers' basic information, perceived usefulness and ease of use of the CV-VSL systems. Technology acceptance model (TAM) was developed to evaluate the drivers' acceptance of CV-VSL systems. A variance analysis method was used to study the influencing factors of drivers' acceptance including drivers' characteristics, technology types and fog density. Findings - The results showed that drivers' acceptance of on-road DMS was significantly higher than that of on-board HMI. The fog density had no significant effect on drivers' acceptance of on-road DMS or on-board HMI. Drivers' gender, age, driving year and driving personality were associated with the acceptance of the two CV-VSL technologies differently. This study is beneficial to the functional improvement of on-road DMS, on-board HMI and their market prospects. Originality/value - Previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CV-VSL systems. However, there were rare studies focused on the drivers' attitude toward using which was also called as acceptance of the CV-VSL systems. Therefore, this research calculated the drivers' acceptance of two normally used CV-VSL systems including on-road DMS and on-board HMI using TAM. Furthermore, variance analysis was conducted to explore whether the factors such as drivers' characteristics (gender, age, driving year and driving personality), technology types and fog density affected the drivers' acceptance of the CV-VSL systems.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-12-2018-0016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999208","Technology acceptance model (TAM);Connected vehicle (CV);Dynamic message sign (DMS);Human machine interface (HMI);Variable speed limit (VSL)","Vehicles;Roads;Safety;Connected vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Meteorology;Accidents","","","","","","","","26 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

As a first step toward solving these problems, this study aims, firstly, to design a surface electromyography (sEMG) controlled steering assistance interface that enables hands-free steering wheel rotation and, secondly, to validate the effect of this rotation on path-following accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 24 drivers used biceps brachii sEMG signals to control the steering assistance interface at a maximized SWR in three driving simulator scenarios: U-turn, 90° turn and 45° turn. For comparison, the scenarios were repeated with a slower SWR and a game steering wheel in place of the steering assistance interface. The path-following accuracy of the steering assistance interface would be validated if it was at least comparable to that of the game steering wheel. Findings - Overall, the steering assistance interface with a maximized SWR was comparable to a game steering wheel. For the U-turn, 90° turn and 45° turn, the sEMG-based human-machine interface (HMI) had median lateral errors of 0.55, 0.3 and 0.2 m, respectively, whereas the game steering wheel, respectively, had median lateral errors of 0.7, 0.4 and 0.3 m. The higher accuracy of the sEMG-based HMI was statistically significant in the case of the U-turn. Originality/value - Although production automobiles do not use sEMG-based HMIs, and few studies have proposed sEMG controlled steering, the results of the current study warrant further development of a sEMG-based HMI for an actual automobile.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-11-2018-0011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999196","Advanced driver assistance systems;Human-machine interface;Myoelectric control system;Path-following;Steering assistance system;Surface electromyography","Wheels;Vehicles;Torque;Automobiles;Injuries;Games;Turning","","","","1","","","","26 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, limited focus has been given to the fallback behavior of automated vehicles, which act as a fail-safe mechanism to deal with safety issues resulting from sensor failure. Therefore, this study aims to establish a fallback control approach aimed at driving an automated vehicle to a safe parking lane under perceptive sensor malfunction. Design/methodology/approach - Owing to an undetected area resulting from a front sensor malfunction, the proposed ADS first creates virtual vehicles to replace existing vehicles in the undetected area. Afterward, the virtual vehicles are assumed to perform the most hazardous driving behavior toward the host vehicle; an adaptive model predictive control algorithm is then presented to optimize the control task during the fallback procedure, avoiding potential collisions with surrounding vehicles. This fallback approach was tested in typical cases related to car-following and lane changes. Findings - It is confirmed that the host vehicle avoid collision with the surrounding vehicles during the fallback procedure, revealing that the proposed method is effective for the test scenarios. Originality/value - This study presents a model for the path-planning problem regarding an automated vehicle under perceptive sensor failure, and it proposes an original path-planning approach based on virtual vehicle scheme to improve the safety of an automated vehicle during a fallback procedure.

New High Speed Chargers can have a power up to 150 kW and Ultra High Speed Chargers up to 350 kW, which could be made out of several modules that can be combined and charge several vehicles. In this article it is investigated how the number of modules influences the charge process. When charging two cars that arrives at the same time, two 75 kW-modules are more favorable than just one 150 kW-module and with two modules the total charging time is almost the same as with five 30 kW-modules. An example case, where the total power is the same, shows that with different sized cars the charging is approximately 39% faster with two modules and 42-44% faster with five modules compared to a case with only one charging outlet and one big module. A power level of 17–20 kW or 30–40 kW could be suitable, one or two parallel SiC power electronic devices with the TO247 package in each position is enough to handle that power level.

The system comprises of a wind energy conversion system having a permanent magnet induction generator (PMIG) and a diesel engine set with a synchronous generator (SG) for power generations. The gap between generated and consumed reactive power in the system causes voltage deviations, at generator terminals. These oscillations further reduce the quality and stability of the power supply. An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) and a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) are used to suppress these voltage deviations. The AVR is used for keeping terminal voltage constant for the synchronous generator while the STATCOM is used as a reactive power compensator. Both AVR and STATCOM are using proportional and integral (PI) controllers with single input. A normalized co-prime factorization is used to represent the possible unstructured uncertainties in the system like variation of system parameters and generating and loading conditions. The performance and robust stability conditions of the control system are made as the optimization problem. The optimization problem is based on the $H$ loop shaping. A hybrid PSO-ICA algorithm is implemented to solve this optimization problem and to achieve PI control parameters of AVR and STATCOM simultaneously. To show the efficiency of the proposed controllers, the performance of the proposed controller is compared with the performance of the conventional controller, and with ICA, PSO and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) based PI controllers for the same system. The dynamic responses of the system for four different small-disturbance case studies have also been carried out in a MATLAB environment.","","979-8-3503-3199-8","10.1109/NORPIE55843.2019.9967822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967822","Hybrid PSO-ICA;Reactive Power;PMIG;STATCOM;AVR","Reactive power;PI control;Costs;Stability criteria;Hybrid power systems;Automatic voltage control;Synchronous generators","asynchronous generators;diesel engines;diesel-electric power stations;distributed power generation;dynamic response;hybrid power systems;intelligent control;particle swarm optimisation;permanent magnet generators;PI control;power generation control;power system stability;reactive power control;robust control;static VAr compensators;synchronous generators;voltage control;voltage regulators;wind power plants","automatic voltage regulator;AVR;control system;diesel engine;dynamic responses;generator terminals;hybrid based approach;hybrid PSO-ICA algorithm;imperialist competitive algorithm;intelligent controller technique;isloated microgrid;loop shaping;MATLAB;normalized co-prime factorization;particle swarm optimization;permanent magnet induction generator;PI control parameters;PMIG;power generations;power supply stability;proportional integral controllers;reactive power control;robust controllers;robust stability conditions;STATCOM;static synchronous compensator;synchronous generator;voltage deviations;voltage fluctuations;whale optimization algorithm;wind diesel;wind energy conversion system;WOA","","","","14","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A range of different input parameters such as annual energy consumption, solar production, consumption pattern and heating system was used to obtain a range of optimal system design parameters. From this, two average system configurations were created for two heating systems based on the results from simulated solar data with 2-axis solar tracking and no solar tracking. The average value from the results at 30 MWh of annual energy consumption was used since it is the average energy consumption for a household in northern Sweden. The average system configuration was applied for 15 to 40 MWh of annual energy consumption using 3 measured solar production datasets and 37 different consumption patterns to study the risk for depleting the hydrogen storage and counter measures to avoid depletion. The results show that energy saving measures must be taken during the winter in order to avoid depletion of the hydrogen energy storage, which in turn avoids a sustained interruption until the spring. It was concluded that if 2-axis solar tracking was used instead of no tracking and a stove was used for heating instead of using a heat pump, the probability for depleting the hydrogen storage reduced by 25% to 47.9% at 30 to 40 MWh of annual energy consumption in the nanogrid.","","979-8-3503-3199-8","10.1109/NORPIE55843.2019.9967824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967824","Energy storage;Hydrogen storage;Islanding;Microgrids;Risk analysis","Energy consumption;Schedules;Hydrogen storage;Heat pumps;Hydrogen;Energy measurement;Solar heating","energy conservation;energy consumption;heat pumps;hydrogen storage;photovoltaic power systems;power generation economics;renewable energy sources;risk analysis;solar cell arrays;solar power;sunlight","2-axis solar tracking;3 measured solar production datasets;30 MWh;37 different consumption patterns;40 MWh;annual energy consumption;average energy consumption;average system configuration;consumption pattern;energy 30.0 MWh;energy 40.0 MWh;energy flow based risk analysis;energy flow model;energy saving measures;heating system;heating systems;hydrogen energy storage;hydrogen storage;northern Scandinavia;optimal system design parameters;simulated solar data;solar photovoltaics;standalone solar-hydrogen nanogrid","","","","13","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The validity of the derived SISO impedances for these two control methods is verified by the experimental frequency scanning. Since the peak dc voltage control is intended for single-phase VSCs with reduced size of the dc capacitor, it is necessary to evaluate its performance with respect to grid interactive stability. By evaluation under various system conditions and different control parameters, it is shown that the peak dc voltage control exhibits a lower stability margin than average dc voltage control.

If a fault occurs at a location behind which the total reactance is capacitive, the result is current inversion, also known as current reversal. In a current inversion, current leads the voltage instead of lagging it. The probability of current inversion increases with higher levels of compensation. In this paper, the effect of current inversion is studied in distance and differential protection of transmission lines. A 500 kV transmission line is modelled, with compensation levels of 70%, 100% and 140%. Phase to ground faults are applied with fault inception angles of 0°, 60° and 90°. It is shown that current inversion can cause serious problems with distance protection. Differential protection is not severely affected by current inversion. The protection schemes are significantly influenced by parameters of the capacitor bank overvoltage protection components, particularly the metal-oxide varistor.","","979-8-3503-3199-8","10.1109/NORPIE55843.2019.9967828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967828","Series Compensation;Current Inversion;Dis-tance Protection;Differential Protection","Varistors;Industrial electronics;Power transmission lines;Circuit breakers;Simulation;Capacitors;Protective relaying","compensation;overvoltage protection;power capacitors;power transmission faults;power transmission lines;power transmission protection;varistors","500 kV transmission line;current inversion increases;current leads;current reversal;high voltage transmission lines;line protection;voltage 500.0 kV","","1","","9","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prospects for decarbonizing the transport sector by electrification escalate these challenges, while availability and sustainability concerns limit biofuel use. Local authorities are committed to contributing to national climate goals, while considering local objectives for economic development, increased energy self-sufficiency and affordable energy costs. This research combines these goals into a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP), and solves the MOOP by interfacing the energy systems simulation tool EnergyPLAN with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) implemented in Matlab. In this way, the study generates optimal solutions for integrated electricity, heating and transport sectors and valuable insights are offered to decision makers in local authorities. Piteå (Norrbotten County, Sweden) is a typical Nordic municipality and serves as a case study for this research. Results show that CO2 emissions from the integrated system can be reduced up to 60% without a considerable increase of total annual costs, and that in the same range of emission reductions it is economically more convenient to invest in electric personal vehicles, light trucks and busses.","","979-8-3503-3199-8","10.1109/NORPIE55843.2019.9967834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967834","multi-objective optimization;renewable energy;electrified transport;biofuels;EnergyPLAN","Vehicle-to-grid;Costs;Heat pumps;Local government;Biological system modeling;Evolutionary computation;Biofuels","air pollution control;biofuel;climate mitigation;cogeneration;decision making;energy conservation;energy consumption;environmental economics;evolutionary computation;investment;optimisation;power system economics;renewable energy sources;sustainable development;transportation","affordable energy costs;cold climate;economic development;electric heating drive energy consumption;electric personal vehicles;energy systems simulation tool EnergyPLAN;increased energy self-sufficiency;integrated system;local authorities;local objectives;MOOP;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization problem;municipal energy systems;national climate goals;Nordic environments;Nordic municipal energy system;optimal solutions;optimal sustainable transport solutions integrated;significant peak electricity demand;sustainability concerns;transport sector;transport sectors;typical Nordic municipality","","","","105","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two frequency sensible control actions are implemented in this paper: a proportional action $(\boldsymbol{K}-\boldsymbol{f})$ and a derivative action $(\boldsymbol{K}-\boldsymbol{d}\boldsymbol{f}/\boldsymbol{d}\boldsymbol{t})$. A simplified version of the NPS is implemented for system frequency response (SFR) studies. Three SFR indicators: minimum frequency, the maximum rate of change of frequency and steady-state frequency are evaluated, considering the two frequency-sensible are assessed.

In this paper, we explicitly model this additional structural information into our estimation algorithm and propose a non-convex regularization of the linear observation model corresponding to the sparse dictionary representation of the radar image. The proposed non-convex regularization encourages block-sparse solutions and incorporates side information from a secondary camera sensor. In addition, the proposed framework also allows us to use structural information learnt using observations over time.

In this chapter, we highlight the confidentiality challenges caused by outsourcing data storage to the cloud as well as some strategies to mitigate them. Because data reduction techniques, such as compression and deduplication, are a key component of cloud storage systems to reduce operational costs but are not effective for encrypted data, we also present in detail the challenges that arise due to the use of these techniques and present a set of mechanisms that can be used to protect tenants’ confidentiality while enabling data reduction techniques.","","9781119053408","10.1002/9781119053385.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821476.pdf&bkn=9820795&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Costs;Data privacy;Encryption;Media;Task analysis;Privacy","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The 2008 economic and financial crisis has had a negative impact on bank lending, and likely on SMEs' life. Through a sample of 166 Italian firms, this chapter tries to gain a better understanding of the access to credit by SMEs and to identify the main difficulties faced by SMEs when trying to raise their credit. It details a national perspective by studying Italian firms. The chapter measures the difficulties faced by Italian SMEs in obtaining financing, considering two periods, before (during the crisis) and after 2013. Instead of using arbitrary measures produced by classical methods, it uses the Rasch model that is able to convert raw scores into a linear and reproducible measurement.","","9781119579649","10.1002/9781119579465.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822535.pdf&bkn=9820831&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Economics;IEEE Sections;Europe;Business;Data analysis;Technological innovation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This includes many professions related to translation, terminology, text search, opinion search, corpus work and search engine work. When the authors talk about computational engineering, they often associate it with the field of natural language processing. In computational engineering, ontologies are graphs that represent semantic relationships between concepts and themes. The authors find that ontologies and taxonomies are two different concepts in linguistics, which can be interesting to apply in the field of SEO. Speaking of semantic scores, the chapter discusses the notion of term frequency‐inverse document frequency, a historical method created in the 1980s by researchers in language and information sciences.

VPCs are global resources, so they are not tied to a specific region or zone. Resources, such as Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) and Kubernetes Engine clusters, can communicate with each other, assuming traffic is not blocked by a firewall rule. VPCs contain subnetworks, call subnets, which are regional resources. Subnets have a range of IP addresses associated with them. Subnets provide private internal addresses. Resources use these addresses to communicate with each other and with Google APIs and services. In addition to VPCs associated with projects, you can create a shared VPC within an organization. The shared VPC is hosted in a common project. Users in other projects who have sufficient permissions can create resources in the shared VPC.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822521.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;IP networks;Routing;Firewalls (computing);Engines;Virtual private networks;Servers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter introduces the Java programming language, including its history, versions, and the four Java platform editions. They are four Java platform editions: Java Card for smartcards, Java Micro Edition for mobile devices, Java Standard Edition for standard personal computers, and Java Enterprise Edition for large distributed enterprise or Internet environments. Java Spring is the most popular development framework for creating Java enterprise applications. The advantages of Java are free cost, simplicity, platform independence, object orientation, security, and multithreading, networking, mobile development and enterprise development. Oracle offers a range of Java certificates, which can be generally divided into two levels, Associate and Professional.","","9781119560005","10.1002/9781119560050.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821932.pdf&bkn=9820822&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Operating systems;Virtual machining;Programming;Program processors;Computer languages;Sun","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It offers a modification of the S‐weighted estimator, which is able to cope with the broken orthogonality condition (S‐weighted instrumental variables). The chapter compares the S‐weighted instrumental variables with classical instrumental variables (which is not robust) and with three other robust versions of instrumental variables, namely instrumental weighted variables, S‐instrumental variables and W‐instrumental variables. The S‐instrumental variables and instrumental weighted variables achieve best results from these three alternative estimators. Finally, the chapter answers to the problem whether the leverage points represent always more complicated problem than outliers.","","9781119597575","10.1002/9781119597568.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822352.pdf&bkn=9820840&pdfType=chapter","","Instruments;Random variables;Proposals;Electric breakdown;Data analysis;Distribution functions;Task analysis","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This approach is described by the risk management process of ISO 27005. The objective of risk analysis methods is only to provide an approach to identify and assess the risks of an information system that is as systematic as possible. This chapter presents in more detail the main steps of a risk analysis method. Attack trees are a graphical representation of combinations and sequences of events that describe the different ways in which a system can be attacked. A cyber Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) can be seen as an extension of a PHA by taking into account cybersecurity issues in the case of a feared event and for barrier failures.","","9781119644514","10.1002/9781119644538.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822014.pdf&bkn=9820857&pdfType=chapter","","Computer security;Risk management;Integrated circuits;Information systems;Object recognition;Control systems;NIST","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A quick look at the growing numbers of network break‐ins tells one that access control is a security hygiene area that needs more attention. But most organizations overlook it because they believe that their current password scheme is adequate, or that options such as multifactor authentication or biometrics are too expensive, cumbersome, or complicated. Access control does not start and stop at the gateway.

This chapter classifies the predefined functions of Structured Query Language (SQL) Server, as well as introduces the user‐defined functions. SQL Server has a very rich set of predefined functions referred to as built‐in functions. These functions can be classified into different categories, mainly scalar functions, aggregation functions and windowing functions. Scalar functions, also called single‐row functions, are those that work on each line of the processed dataset and return one output per line. Within this category, another classification exists which distinguishes between numerical scalar functions, string processing, processing of dates, conversion, null value processing and logical functions. Analytic functions are a powerful mechanism for succinctly representing complex analytic operations. They allow efficient evaluations that would otherwise involve costly auto‐joins or calculations outside the SQL query language. These analytic functions can be classified into three categories: ranking, distribution and offset functions.","","9781119649274","10.1002/9781119649540.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823242.pdf&bkn=9820862&pdfType=chapter","","Structured Query Language;Servers;Databases;Null value;Technological innovation;Security;Random number generation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

From the perspective of the information systems designer and builder, all of the action happens at the endpoints. These endpoints are where the real, tangible physical world of things and people is transformed by modeling, abstraction, and reduction into a handful of data values. It's where a similar handful of data values causes huge industrial equipment to move , to change its “end effectors” by swapping out one cutting tool for another, or hoisting this instead of that , and the result is physical, real change in the world we live in.

Cloud DNS is a managed service providing authoritative domain naming services. It is designed for high availability, low latency, and scalability. Load balancing services in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offer five types of load balancers to address a range of needs. In this chapter, you will see how HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, Network TCP/UDP, and Internal TCP/ UDP Network differ and when to use each. Cloud engineers should also be familiar with managing IP addresses, in particular managing Classless Inter‐Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks and understanding how to reserve IP addresses. Cloud DNS is a Google service that provides domain name resolution. At the most basic level, DNS services map domain names, such as example.com, to IP addresses, such as 35.20.24.107. A managed zone contains DNS records associated with a DNS name suffix, such as aceexamdns1.com. DNS records contain specific details about a zone.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822864.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Cloud computing;Servers;Load management;Virtual machining;Security;Scalability","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It reviews the different models and systems that have been proposed in the discipline. The chapter provides a clear definition of trust. It presents a historical view on the evolution of such systems from access control to a trust management system. The chapter includes a survey in which the most relevant trust management systems are presented providing an overview of the existing systems. The systems are also structured by grouping similar systems into three categories: authorization‐based, role‐based and negotiation‐based. The chapter describes applications of trust management systems in cloud infrastructures. Trust management has its roots in security and more particularly in access control.

There are four main reasons (the “whys”) that drive organizations to implement a security awareness training program: compliance; information dissemination; behavior shaping; and culture shaping. The chapter represents the author's take on how each of the four “whys” map to a level of effectiveness in impacting an organization's human‐based security risk. Awareness programs that focus on compliance or simply sharing information are of inherently limited benefit. Such programs are either overly formulaic, thereby often becoming rote exercises that feel irrelevant and soulless, or focus on information sharing with the futile hope that presenting people with good information will result in those people automatically retaining and applying the information.

Cryptography includes methods such as symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures. Each provides specific attributes and solutions. Authentication is another key goal of cryptography. First, authentication is associated with digital signatures. Authentication provides a way to ensure that a message is from whom we believe it's from. In its basic form, authentication is used to determine identity. It is also part of the identification and authentication process. Integrity is another cryptographic goal. Integrity is important while data is in transmission and in storage. Integrity means that information remains unaltered. The designer of a cryptographic system must also understand the implications of cryptographic methods and design. The strength of the encryption process is based in part on the cryptographic key. The cryptographic key, or simply key, is a piece of information that controls how the cryptographic algorithm functions. It can be used to control the transformation of plain text to cipher text or cipher text to plain text.","","9781119477716","10.1002/9781119575948.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823248.pdf&bkn=9820830&pdfType=chapter","","Cryptography;Encryption;Security;Ciphers;Digital signatures;Authentication;Portable computers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This is foundational. Security leaders can use the information to justify their investment of time and resources working on end‐user training. And it provides enough ammo to shut down any naysayers who might argue that security awareness is a waste of time. Given the connection between the human element and data breaches, it is easy to see why auditors and regulators are making security awareness training a key element in their audit and regulatory requirements. To serve as examples, the chapter presents a list of ten regulations and standards across a variety of industries that specify the need for security awareness training. The large body of audit, regulatory requirements, and recommended best‐practice standards all point to employee training as a critical element in an organization's cybersecurity program.","","9781119566373","10.1002/9781119566380.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822619.pdf&bkn=9820827&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Behavioral sciences;Organizations;Data breach;Standards organizations;Phishing;Electronic mail","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The chapter provides new results on the linear approximation of the TAR model. Some examples with simulated data give evidence of the advantages that can be obtained from the use of the theoretical issues. The chapter highlights that the ARMA approximation is obtained by reparameterizing the threshold process that, under proper conditions on the values assumed by its autoregressive coefficients, becomes a “purely” nonlinear process.","","9781119597575","10.1002/9781119597568.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822312.pdf&bkn=9820840&pdfType=chapter","","Linear approximation;Data models;Mathematical models;Data analysis;Analytical models;Time series analysis;Technological innovation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The problem is that most organizations fall into the trap of believing that flinging a video or learning module at their employee‐base is the way to “do” security awareness. It is important to understand how people naturally think, behave, express preferences, make choices, and adopt new beliefs if he/she ever wants to be effective in shaping their security‐related thoughts and actions.

As the prevalence and usage of networked Cloud computer systems increases, logically the likelihood of these systems being used for criminal behaviour also increases. On the other hand, the field of digital forensics has grown rapidly over the last decade due to the rise of the internet and associated crimes; however, while the theory is well established, the practical application of the discipline is still new and developing. Law enforcement agencies can no longer rely on traditional forensic methods of data acquisition through device seizure to gather relevant evidence pertaining to an investigation. Using traditional digital forensic methods will lead to the loss of valuable evidential material if employed during investigations that involve Cloud based infrastructures. Consequently, cloud computing and its impact on digital forensics will continue to grow. In this chapter, we review traditional digital forensics methods and explain why these are inadequate for Cloud forensic investigations with particular focus on law enforcement. We then present digital forensic processes and models to acquiring data from Cloud environments. These processes and models aim to overcome the limitations of traditional digital forensics and the challenges Cloud computing presents for digital forensic practitioners.

An industrial IS, or an industrial control system (ICS), is a system composed of an IS plus specific equipment for control and measurement. This chapter shows architecture of a traditional industrial IS, which is called supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or distributed control system. A remote telemetry unit (RTU) is a microprocessor‐controlled electronic device that connects a physical system to a master system, typically a programmable logic controller, master terminal unit or SCADA. The programmable automation controller has more connectivity and can manage remote modules similar to RTU. Human‐machine interfaces are an essential part of ICS which allows the user to visualize how the system works and take the necessary actions.","","9781119644514","10.1002/9781119644538.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822774.pdf&bkn=9820857&pdfType=chapter","","Information systems;Software;Integrated circuits;Industrial Internet of Things;Industrial control;Image color analysis;Computer security","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter contributes to the related literature by proposing a method for monitoring the compliance of countries on emission mitigation using dissimilarity indices. The method will not only examine the effective measurement of emissions' dissimilarity among members, but it will also contribute to the identification of the “free rider” problem in climate coalitions. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the gases that trap heat into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide holds the largest proportion of GHGs. The measurement of the reduction of environmental inequality on carbon emissions is important for policy makers in order to promote global cooperation. The first attempt for an agreement that set targets on carbon emissions was made in 1997 with the Kyoto protocol. The necessary condition to promote the cooperation between countries is to decrease the observed inequality regarding the emissions mitigation.","","9781119579649","10.1002/9781119579465.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821597.pdf&bkn=9820831&pdfType=chapter","","Carbon dioxide;Meteorology;Indexes;Protocols;Pollution measurement;Monitoring;Data analysis","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Sensors are disappearing, becoming disposable yet indispensable for the crucial advancement of human lives. Through a variety of proven miniaturization technologies, microscale sensors are being designed and developed to have multifaceted features. Interestingly the sensor deployment is also easy and quick. Further on, the embedded communication module enables sensors to find one another spontaneously in the vicinity to talk to one another in order to share their unique capabilities. Through the appropriate placement of sensor gateways in any sensor‐stuffed environments, all kinds of ground‐level sensors are being integrated with remotely held cloud applications and databases to exhibit a kind of smart behavior. Sensor networking is being accelerated through a variety of network topologies and technologies. Thus sensor‐to‐sensor, sensor‐to‐device, and sensor‐to‐cloud integrations are being accomplished in order to produce bigger and better applications for mankind. In short, the sensor technology is on the faster track to conceptualize and concretize a bevy of people‐centric, mission‐critical, event‐driven, service‐oriented, cloud‐hosted, situation‐aware, and knowledge‐filled applications. This chapter highlights the significance of multi‐sensor data fusion in context awareness for realizing the next‐generation smarter environments along with the several real‐world use cases.A variety of sensor‐centric use cases is being prescribed by worldwide IT professionals and professors. All key industry verticals and application domains embrace this path‐breaking sensor paradigm to envisage sophisticated and smarter applications. Sensor manufacturers are investing their time, treasure, and talent to bring forth innovative, disruptive, and transformative sensors for IT professionals to visualize scores of connected and cognitive applications.

Access control and identity management have taken a center‐stage role in our continuing struggle to secure information systems. Several trend lines are merging together, it seems, as we think about how our information and our information security tools are getting smarter. One trend we see is how applied artificial intelligence (AI) is creating many different paradigms for software to interact with other software and, in the process, make the physical hardware that hosts that software take action in ways that perhaps are not quite what we anticipated when we built it. Another trend is in machine learning (ML), which is a subset of applied AI. ML, as it's called, tends to use meshes of processing elements (which can each be in software, hardware, or both) that look for statistical relationships between input conditions and desired outputs from that mesh; this training takes thousands of sets of inputs and lets the mesh compute its own parameters by which each processing element manipulates its inputs and its memory of previous results to produce and share an output with others in the mesh.","","9781119542957","10.1002/9781119547921.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822787.pdf&bkn=9820816&pdfType=chapter","","Information security;Access control;Behavioral sciences;Market research;Machine learning;Information systems;Faces","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The media seem to have gradually freed themselves from political power over time. This is what research tends to show. Information bias can also come from the intervention of experts to provide information. Experts can use their reputation to give credibility to a speech that presents an ideological bias. The impact of the media on global change is an eternal subject of study where all scientific disciplines, including economics, intersect and meet. In order to assess the attitude of the press, Latham uses the Puglisi method, in other words, he identifies financial problems related to elected officials and checks whether press coverage of the same type of event varies according to government polls.

The GARCH models have been developed for analyzing time series of stock returns. Usually, the expected value function of a GARCH model is assumed to be constant. However, this assumption is not appropriate when a time series includes a varying trend. This chapter proposes a trend model, which can be easily taken in intervention analysis. It generalizes a GARCH model for an intervention analysis for both trend and volatility based on this trend model. An identification method is also provided and evaluated by simulation studies. Usability of the proposed model is demonstrated by applying to real stock returns. It should be noted that the calculation for volatility estimation requires the numerical optimization under the constraint.","","9781119597575","10.1002/9781119597568.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822934.pdf&bkn=9820840&pdfType=chapter","","Market research;Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Time series analysis;Data models;Economics;Data analysis","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Evaluation of Stopping Criteria for Ranks in Solving Linear Systems","B. Abola; P. Biganda; C. Engström; S. Silvestrov",NA; NA; NA; NA,"Data Analysis and Applications 1: Clustering and Regression, Modeling-estimating, Forecasting and Data Mining","","2019","","","137","152","Bioinformatics, internet search engines (web pages) and social networks are some of the examples with large and high sparsity matrices. For some of these systems, only the actual ranks of the solution vector is interesting rather than the vector itself. In this case, it is desirable that the stopping criterion reflects the error in ranks rather than the residual vector that might have a lower convergence. This chapter evaluates stopping criteria on Jacobi, successive over relaxation (SOR) and power series iterative schemes.

Tanner",NA,"Cybersecurity Blue Team Toolkit","","2019","","","147","163","This chapter helps the cybersecurity professionals to understand web development, information gathering, domain name system, defense in depth, and offense: burp suite. The progression of the Web has led to a need for the evolution of web application testing. There are many reasons for problems in securing web applications. Web application architecture is the interaction between applications, middleware, and the databases the application relies on. Most web applications use the authentication, session management, and access control triad to reduce their attack surface. Input validation is done so that only properly formed data can be placed in a web application field. While browsing a target application, penetration testers can configure their Internet browser to route traffic through the proxy server. Burp Suite then captures and analyzes each request to and from the target web application. This allows the interception, inspection, and possible modification of the raw traffic.","","9781119552956","10.1002/9781119552963.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822770.pdf&bkn=9820820&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Browsers;Software;Internet;Application security;Testing;Middleware","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It discusses two topics that are crucial in argument mining: first, the need for knowledge and inference to bind a claim with an attack or a support when they are not adjacent, and second, the need to present a synthesis of the arguments that have been mined. Designing an argument synthesis is a delicate task that requires taking into account users' profiles, for example, the type of information that is useful to them, the features which are the most prominent, and the level of granularity they expect. In natural language generation, the main projects on argumentation generation were developed as early as 2000 by I. Zukerman et al. and then by A. Fiedler and H.

A “data‐driven” company is one that strives to make better decisions, by individuals and in decision‐making groups, up and down the organization chart, every day. This means making slightly better decisions today than yesterday and slightly better decisions tomorrow than today. The spirit of being data‐driven involves a passion to reduce that uncertainty to 50% the next time an equivalent decision comes up. This thinking is especially important for data scientists. In the near term, the real work of data scientists and chief analytics officers involves understanding the strengths and weaknesses of decision‐makers and taking them into account. In the longer term, the real work involves helping the individual decision‐makers and the entire organization to become more data‐driven.","","9781119570714","10.1002/9781119570790.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821889.pdf&bkn=9820828&pdfType=chapter","","Uncertainty;Companies;Face recognition;Data science;Turning;Training;Time factors","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Impact assessment is important so data scientists (and CAOs and groups of data scientists) can show others what they contribute in concrete terms.

Security baselines are, quite simply, “good advice” from Microsoft to ensure that Windows 10's settings are set up to defend from the most common attacks. Security baselines are a smorgasbord of settings, served up all at once. Security baselines come in two forms: predefined advice in the form of Group Policy Objects that you can consume and use on‐prem and, now, predefined advice you can use inside an MDM service like Intune. The Security Configuration Framework is a subset of the advice in the baselines that can be used for specific machines. The basic idea is to plunk the most important security settings on the right kinds of boxes. Many of the security baselines settings are hard to see or hard to immediately test. But there are a few that you can. Perhaps the easiest would be to see if you've actually enabled SmartScreen for Edge. AppLocker as a whitelisting solution has been around for a long time, since Windows 7. But Applocker with Group Policy only works with Windows 10 Enterprise and Education editions.

First is data scientists' choice of the word “customer.” They found that viewing decision‐makers as customers humanizes them. A customer can come from a different part of the organization, be way up in the hierarchy, or be based in another part of the world. Second, “in their languages.” Third is “discovering the real problems.” It is a rare decision‐maker indeed who can articulate the real problem in the first try.

It also discusses pre‐emptible virtual machines and when they can help reduce your overall computing costs. GCP offers several computing options. The options vary in the level of control that you, as a user of GCP, have over the computing platform. Generally, with more control comes more responsibility and management overhead. Your objective when choosing a computing platform is to choose one that meets your requirements while minimizing DevOps overhead and cost. Compute Engine is the GCP service that lets you provision VMs. You can choose from predefined configurations, or you can create a custom configuration with the best combination of virtual CPUs and memory for your needs. If you can tolerate some disruption in VM functioning, you can save a significant amount of money by using pre‐emptible VMs.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822448.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Operating systems;Engines;Cloud computing;Servers;Linux;Virtual machining;Navigation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Daniel Cid, the author of OSSEC, often refers to it in the log analysis portion of OSSEC as a log‐based intrusion detection system. With the proper agents installed on cybersecurity professionals' assets and logs being processed by OSSEC, they meet the criteria for another Center for Internet Security control. Two types of agents will feed data into OSSEC: installable and agentless. Installable agents are installed on hosts, and they report to the server; agentless agents require no installation on a remote host. Both of these processes are started and maintained from the OSSEC manager. After information is gathered, it uses SSH, RDP, SNMP, or WMI to send the data to the manager for processing and decoding. When one is monitoring processes on an asset with OSSEC, the logs that are generated are parsed with the rules contained within the database.","","9781119552956","10.1002/9781119552963.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822503.pdf&bkn=9820820&pdfType=chapter","","Monitoring;Servers;Security;Intrusion detection;Decoding;Passwords;Libraries","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

To develop a deeper appreciation for a scientific framework for handling bias in decision making, data scientists should study the groundbreaking work of two psychologists: Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. They established behavioral economics, a new domain of great importance to data science. Learning how to spot and avoid bias in one's own decisions will give him/her a new appreciation for how insidious bias is and how difficult it is to eliminate.

Joining in relational databases means extracting data from multiple linked tables. The data to be searched is distributed over several tables to comply with the normalization rules of the relational model. The JOIN operator reflects considerable processing by the DBMS to improve performance. These efforts are materialized by three optimization algorithms which are NESTED LOOP, MERGE SORT and HASH. These concepts fall within the theme of Structured Query Language (SQL) query performance generally referred to as SQL Tuning. The set operations, which are UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, CROSS JOIN and division, allow tables to be treated as sets. The operators used, although not standardized, exist in most database management systems under different names. Pivoting operators, also known as Rotation Operators, are new features integrated into the relational model.","","9781119649274","10.1002/9781119649540.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822598.pdf&bkn=9820862&pdfType=chapter","","Image color analysis;Servers;Standards;Data mining;Tuning;Technological innovation;Semantics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

To master cybersecurity, people must master the challenge of patching and develop security solutions that somehow overcome the human tendency to ignore the fundamental need to patch. Of course, patching does not happen in isolation. It must be part of a larger security framework that includes different functions working together alongside patch management. Data discovery and asset discovery are critical components of any patch management program. Patch management is a continual process that requires knowing what patches are available, knowing what patches are necessary for particular systems, ensuring they are installed properly and tested, and maintaining all the documentation associated with these procedures. Multiple vendors have technologies to help automate the patch management process. Organizations should evaluate these technologies to see what would be most effective for their environments.","","9781119617389","10.1002/9781119617396.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821976.pdf&bkn=9820847&pdfType=chapter","","Organizations;Task analysis;Computer hacking;Computer crime;Internet of Things;Viruses (medical);Thermodynamics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Vulnerability is a weakness in a system design, in the implementation of an operational procedure, or in how software or code was developed (for example, bugs, backdoors, vulnerabilities in code, and so forth). Vulnerabilities may be eliminated or reduced by the correct implementation of safeguards and security countermeasures. When dealing with risk, software is one area with which the security professional must be very concerned. Risk isn't just associated with software; it also is related to new products, new technologies, and user behavior. Organizations face many types of risks. Operational risk is risk that is associated with operations. Operational risk is defined by a company's internal and external practices. Such risk can be brought about by the location in which a company does business, or it can be defined by internal and external sources, such as government agencies and regulatory requirements. The business model has a large influence on operational risk. It includes issues such as physical location, production capabilities, purpose, new or changing business strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, trading practices, and operational processes and policies.","","9781119477716","10.1002/9781119575948.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822587.pdf&bkn=9820830&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Risk management;Industries;Hardware;Viruses (medical);Servers;Denial-of-service attack","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Only traffic cops and road authorities are allowed to control the traffic signals. Most of the time, the traffic signals are unmanned. In a situation where an ambulance is approaching toward the red signal, all vehicles in front have to move forward to allow and make a way (path) for it. While this takes place, the opposite side of the traffic will have a green signal and are free to go. When both of the above scenarios take place at one time, all the vehicles in traffic signal will be moving without any control. It ends up in a traffic jam, while the ambulance is waiting at the back. This happens every day in major cities throughout India. Objective: To address this, if a sensor is kept in the traffic signals, it will sense the ambulance sound and switch the red signal into green signal. The ambulance approaching the traffic will have a green signal, and all the other traffic signals will change into a red signal. In this way, the ambulance will not be blocked because of a traffic jam, and it will reach the hospital faster. Techniques: Here, to separate the ambulance sound from all other sounds recorded in the sensor device, classification algorithm is implemented. It acts as a medium to separate the ambulance sound and sends it to the sensor device. Once the device receives the ambulance sound, subsequently it will change the red signal to green signal and block all the other signals. Algorithms: Anomaly detection is the identification of items, events, or observations which do not match the expected pattern or other items in a dataset. It is used here to separate the ambulance siren from other sounds received in the device. Ambulance siren is saved already, and the device recognizes it once the sound is received. Next, we use pattern matching algorithm to match the received sound with direction and check with the saved ambulance siren in the device. When those two sounds match, the embedded system directs the traffic signal to change from red to green, blocking every other traffic signal with red. Applications: The proposed system can be implemented in critical care unit and newborn baby incubation center and for transporting human organs from one city to another city with the essential alterations.","","9781119438991","10.1002/9781119439004.ch16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821492.pdf&bkn=9820809&pdfType=chapter","","Pattern matching;Anomaly detection;Support vector machines;Hospitals;Estimation;Acoustics;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Policies and procedures are the controlling documents that dictate how activities occur in each of the functional areas. There are two basic ways in which policies can be developed. In some organizations, policy development starts at the top of the organization. This approach, known as top‐down policy development, means that policies are pushed down t from senior management to the lower layers of the company. The big advantage of top‐down policy development is that it ensures that policy is aligned with the strategy and vision of senior management. Policies are high‐level documents, developed by management, to transmit the overall strategy and philosophy of management to all employees.

One of the reasons for the decline of Mark Zuckerberg's network is the rise of messaging companies such as WhatsApp, particularly in specific countries. Most media have developed strategies to make the best use of social networks. One of the criticisms made to social networks by the media is that they cut the link with the reader. The other major criticism that the media is making of social networks is about revenue sharing. The development of social networks has important consequences for the profession of journalists. Journalist directly feed into the network or write directly or indirectly via the media that employs them, which are often present on social networks.

It analyzes the approach of statistical entropy to five‐star ratings and the statistical distributions resulting from the max entropy principle. The chapter applies the entropy maximization subject to the expected value and variance constraints for cases of k = 2,3,4,5,6,. ,30 response items in a rating system. It exhibits the implications of an entropy approach to real five‐star rating data using a large 1,000‐sample rating data set. From the classical statistical point of view, the average and variance of data are the most rational choices to apply the max entropy principle. The used 1,000‐sample rating data set shows that upper and lower limits of entropy are visible on a normalized entropy chart for the real data.","","9781119579649","10.1002/9781119579465.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823241.pdf&bkn=9820831&pdfType=chapter","","Entropy;Probability;Statistical distributions;Optimization;Data analysis;Uncertainty;Particle measurements","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The goals of both of these technologies is ostensibly the same: Instead of wiping and reloading a machine with a perfectly good operating system already on it, you get to use what the OEM shipped in the box. Then get close to your desired configuration goals… faster. Autopilot is getting a lot of buzz. Like if you ask 100 admins why MDM is a “cool thing,” almost all of them would say, “Autopilot!” But then ask an IT admin how Autopilot changes the game; you might get a variety of stories. Here's the point of Autopilot: Instead of taking a nice, brand‐new machine from the factory and ghosting it, MDT‐ing it, or otherwise nuking it to overwrite it with your “unique snowflake” image, you can stop all that madness. Autopilot is a cloud‐based service, run by Microsoft, which stores hardware IDs (more in a minute). When a machine turns on for the first time and is registered in your Autopilot, something magical happens. Autopilot will dictate a few final setup instructions, reducing the interaction by the end user to a few, or even zero, clicks before the machine is ready to be used by the end user.","","9781119564348","10.1002/9781119564362.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822461.pdf&bkn=9820825&pdfType=chapter","","Lifting equipment;Operating systems;Autopilot;Portable computers;Computers;Companies;Wireless fidelity","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The benefits are enormous, from cost to convenience to reliability to security itself. But it is inherently a feudal relationship. We cede control of our data and computing platforms to these companies and trust that they will treat us well and protect us from harm. And if we pledge complete allegiance to them‐if we let them control our email and calendar and address book and photos and everything‐we get even more benefit. There are a lot of feudal lords out there. Google and Apple are the obvious ones, but Microsoft is trying to control both user data and the end‐user platform as well.

Business logic failed to anticipate some special conditions, and as a result, well‐meaning employees are forced to make educated guesses to attempt to satisfy a customer's needs. The assumptions that one employee made in handing a special situation may not be documented well enough for other employees, further along the information processing chain, to notice where errors were made that need to be corrected. Bad data, or not quite complete data, gets accepted as valid as a result. Depending on the nature of the organization, the business disruption cause significant, resulting in lost sales opportunities, delays in handling emergency services dispatch center calls, or even a safety‐critical shutdown of an assembly line or processing pipeline if the server isn't there to provide support when needed.

Venkatamari","Department of CSE, Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education, Krishnankoil, Tamil Nadu, India; Department of ECE, Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education, Krishnankoil, Tamil Nadu, India","Intelligent Pervasive Computing Systems for Smarter Healthcare","","2019","","","207","225","In the current era of wireless body area network (WBAN), pervasive computing technology brings healthcare to a new level of personalization. Integrating this kind of energy‐efficient routing protocol networks with the more advanced and emerging technologies like mobile phones and personal digital assistance devices (PDAs) makes the network more fascinating and advanced toward the growth and rapid delivery of critical data with less amount of energy during data transmission. In this chapter, we proposed a novel energy‐efficient computing method called threshold‐based routing protocol to route the critical data in WBANs during emergency condition. Biosensors are deployed to fixed locations on the human body to measure important vital signs and perform computing in a regular and continuous manner. Different threshold values are assigned for heterogeneous biosensors, based on the values assigned data is generated for transmission to the sink in case of critical health condition.During transmission, energy condition has to be satisfied to reach the sink. Based on the changes in threshold condition, data is generated and forwarded to the sink. Cost function parameter is used for the selection of intermediate node/forwarder node (FN) based on the maximum residual energy and less distance between the nodes. Thus, there is a balance between energy consumption among the nodes and successful packet distribution to the sink.

"Is the Printed Newspaper Gamble Crazy?","D. Augey; M. Alcaraz",NA; NA,"Digital Information Ecosystems: Smart Press","","2019","","","87","113","The arrival of digital technology 20 years ago was both hopeful and a great concern. It was hopeful because the press crisis had begun long before. It was also a huge concern because it raised many issues, the two main ones being: how journalists work in this new context, and how the press builds its new business model. Audience analysis also reflects changes in behavior, to the benefit of digital technology. Several newspaper creations have gone straight for the Internet in recent years. With the constant belief that digital technology seems to be the future, most media have therefore sought to develop their digital versions and, above all, to monetize them, particularly via subscription. The impact of the Internet is steeper for the local press than for the national press. The reason seems to be a greater dependence of local newspapers on classified ads, which were a major source of revenue.","","9781119579731","10.1002/9781119579717.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821941.pdf&bkn=9820832&pdfType=chapter","","Presses;Mobile handsets;Media;Ecosystems;Companies;Technological innovation;Journalism","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In the world of information security, we often consider three properties of a system that must be guaranteed: the availability (A) of services, the integrity (I) of software and data and the confidentiality (C) of information. To analyze the differences in cybersecurity between the operation technology and IT worlds, the chapter considers four aspects: the expected functionalities; the technology used; the lifecycle of the system; and security management. The cultural difference between the IT and OT world is therefore rooted in the very birth of the programmable logic controller (PLC). A remote telemetry unit is a microprocessor‐controlled electronic device that connects a physical system to a master system, typically a PLC, master terminal unit or supervisory control and data acquisition.","","9781119644514","10.1002/9781119644538.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822042.pdf&bkn=9820857&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Integrated circuits;Safety;Real-time systems;Production;Cyber-physical systems;Authentication","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Kubernetes Engine is Google Cloud Platform's (GCP's) managed Kubernetes service. With this service, GCP customers can create and maintain their own Kubernetes clusters without having to manage the Kubernetes platform. Kubernetes runs containers on a cluster of virtual machines (VMs). It determines where to run containers, monitors the health of containers, and manages the full lifecycle of VM instances. This collection of tasks is known as container orchestration. A Kubernetes cluster consists of a cluster master and one or more nodes, which are the workers of the cluster. The cluster master controls the cluster and can be replicated and distributed for high‐availability and fault tolerance. The cluster master manages services provided by Kubernetes, such as the Kubernetes API, controllers, and schedulers. All interactions with the cluster are done through the master using the Kubernetes API. The cluster master issues the command that performs an action on a node.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822376.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Containers;Engines;IP networks;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Servers;Virtual machining","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter considers the positions of 28 German parties on 38 policy issues declared before the 2013 federal election and associates the parties with the 38‐dimensional vectors of their policy profiles. It empirically tests the thesis about multiplicity of equally significant political dimensions with an example from the German political space, as it is given in the German VAA, Wahl‐O‐Mat. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that the parties constitute a thin ellipsoid whose two longest diameters cover 83.4 percent of the total variance. Reducing the model to just these two dimensions, a one‐dimensional party ordering is found, which is exactly the left‐right axis rolled into a circumference, reflecting that the far‐left and far‐right ends of the political spectrum approach each other, although remain distant, resulting in its horseshoe‐like shape.","","9781119579649","10.1002/9781119579465.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821907.pdf&bkn=9820831&pdfType=chapter","","Voting;Road transportation;Principal component analysis;Europe;Data analysis;Cultural differences;Weapons","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The top 4 SEO criteria of Baidu are: shares by users; link building; the brand's influence (branding, brand image); and opinions from SNS. Unlike Baidu, Yandex is more similar to Google in terms of the technical parts and the consideration of some tags such as canonical tags, hreflang, meta‐itemprop tags, etc. The study of keywords to be carried out is identical to that of Google.

Our brief history of the media economy can be divided into two periods: the early stages in the 1960s, and then, after a period of sleep, a renewal since the 2000s. Scientific journals in economics adopt a method of classifying articles that are common to all journals. A very different way of looking at the role of media is to measure its impact on a particular economic sector. The influence of the media on stock prices concerns the role played by the press and the information it disseminates in the evolution of asset prices and stock prices.","","9781119579731","10.1002/9781119579717.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822189.pdf&bkn=9820832&pdfType=chapter","","Media;Presses;TV;Advertising;Internet;Game theory;Europe","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Risk tolerance is both cultural and dependent on the environment around us. As we have advanced technologically as a society, we have reduced many of the risks that have been with us for millennia. Fatal childhood diseases are things of the past, many adult diseases are curable, accidents are rarer and more survivable, buildings collapse less often, death by violence has declined considerably, and so on. Some of this fear results from imperfect risk perception. We're bad at accurately assessing risk; we tend to exaggerate spectacular, strange, and rare events, and downplay ordinary, familiar, and common ones. This leads us to believe that violence against police, school shootings, and terrorist attacks are more common. Security measures combat a very different sort of risk: a risk stemming from another person. People are intelligent, and they can adapt to new security measures in ways nature cannot.","","9781119643463","10.1002/9781119653554.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822447.pdf&bkn=9820866&pdfType=chapter","","Internet;Surveillance;Terrorism;Government;Law enforcement;Accidents;Diseases","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A popular approach for performing high‐level evaluation includes threat modeling, which provides opportunities for future scenario and Course of Action (COA) use cases. The ARMOUR Framework provides example technical and operational scenarios with the aim of supporting an overall cyber framework. Protective cyber scenarios take a variety of forms. Proactive scenarios are used to evaluate how the network responds to anomalies, or time to detect anomalous devices and configuration changes. Reactive scenarios, on the other hand, often training focused, and are used to perform standard Disaster Recovery/Continuity of Operations (DR/COOP) enterprise evaluations. Technical scenarios primarily deal with network anomalies.

The defense‐in‐depth approach looks at more than just basic security concepts. This methodology is the sum of the methods, techniques, tools, people, and controls used to protect critical assets and information. Comprehensive controls are needed because so many more systems are connected to the Internet, and so much more sensitive data is now stored in electronic systems than in the past. A review of CERT statistics over the last several years shows steady increases in the numbers of reported incidents and vulnerabilities. Network authentication is a key area of knowledge for the security professional because it serves as the first line of defense. It consists of two pieces: identification and authentication. There are many different network designs, such as bus, ring, star, and even mesh. The Internet is an example of a mesh network. It is a network of networks; one in which there are many paths that data can traverse to a given destination. The mesh network design is configured so that each node can forward data. One of the big advantages of a mesh network is its ability to self‐heal. This simply means that if one node goes down, there are others to take its place.","","9781119477716","10.1002/9781119575948.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821950.pdf&bkn=9820830&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Authentication;Organizations;Firewalls (computing);Protocols;Internet;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

When annotating a text to analyze arguments, it is necessary to first determine the text parts that bear an argumentative function. In the literature, these are called Argumentative Discourse Units. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) is a descriptive theory that aims at eliciting rhetorical relations in written texts. RST allows revealing the structure of natural language texts by showing the different relations between text portions. In order to ensure the reproducibility of annotations by several annotators, the concepts involved need to be delimited, an annotation protocol needs to be established and human annotators must be trained. Annotation guidelines serve these purposes: they establish a method for the detection and annotation of argument structures and components.","","9781119671169","10.1002/9781119507291.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823081.pdf&bkn=9820811&pdfType=chapter","","Annotations;Vaccines;Diseases;Task analysis;Guidelines;Africa;Urban areas","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The use of cyberspace by terrorists is considered, along with other factors that might render Cloud‐based services more vulnerable to terrorist activities. In this context, we explore the nexus between cyberlaw and cyberterrorism, with focus upon jurisdictional issues and issues that arise when dealing with politically‐charged, transnational events. To conclude, we contemplate the prospects for future directions in cyberterrorism, and the prospects that the Cloud might facilitate or become a target of such attacks.","","9781119053408","10.1002/9781119053385.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821442.pdf&bkn=9820795&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Cyber terrorism;Computer worms;Statistics;Sociology;Cyber warfare;Privacy","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Planning Storage in the Cloud","D. Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide","","2019","","","241","274","This Chapter includes guidelines for choosing storage solutions for different kinds of requirements. When planning cloud storage, consider the types of storage systems and types of data models. The storage systems provide the hardware and basic organizational structure used for storing data. The data models organize data into logical structures that determine how data is stored and queried within a database. The main storage systems available in GCP are Memorystore, a managed cache service, and persistent disks, which are network‐accessible disks for VMs in Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine. Cloud Storage is GCP's object storage system. The primary data models are object, relational, and NoSQL. NoSQL databases in GCP are further subdivided into document and wide‐column databases. Cloud Storage uses an object data model. Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner use relational databases for transaction processing applications. BigQuery uses a relational model for data warehouse and analytic applications. Datastore and Firebase are document databases. Bigtable is a wide‐column table.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822719.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Engines;Planning;Internet;Servers;Memory management;IP networks;Hard disks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In any hybrid security system, the human portion needs to trust the machine portion. To do so, both must understand the expected behavior for every state‐how the system can fail and what those failures look like. The machine must be able to communicate its state and have the capacity to alert the humans when an expected state transition doesn't happen as expected. Things will go wrong, either by accident or as the result of an attack, and the humans are going to need to troubleshoot the system in real time‐that requires understanding on both parts. Each time things go wrong, and the machine portion doesn't communicate well, the human portion trusts it a little less. Humans and machines have different strengths. Humans are flexible and can do creative thinking in ways that machines cannot. But they're easily fooled. Machines are more rigid and can handle state changes and process flows much better than humans can. But they're bad at dealing with exceptions.","","9781119643463","10.1002/9781119653554.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822331.pdf&bkn=9820866&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Passwords;Government;Engineering profession;Social networking (online);Logic gates;Law enforcement","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It proposes a clustering strategy that processes online the incoming observations in order to find groups of sensors that behave similarly over time. The proposed strategy is made by two phases: the online phase aims at summarizing the incoming data; the offline phase provides the partitioning of the streams into clusters. In the online phase, the incoming observations are split into batches. The proposal consists of summarizing each subsequence in the batch by a histogram. Finally, a fast clustering algorithm is performed on these summaries in order to get a local partitioning of the subsequences. The offline step finds a consensus partition starting from the achieved local partitions. Through an application on real data, the chapter shows the effectiveness of the strategy in finding homogeneous groups of data streams.","","9781119597575","10.1002/9781119597568.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822800.pdf&bkn=9820840&pdfType=chapter","","Time series analysis;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Data mining;Histograms;Proposals;Data analysis","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Virtualized computing has come a long way in the last 10 to 15 years, and it can be found everywhere today, from major businesses to small office, home office (SOHO) computing environments. Advances in computing have brought about more changes than just virtualization. Network storage and cloud computing are two other changes. Cloud computing, in particular, is changing the concept of network boundaries. The term enterprise security refers to a holistic view of security. Our view of IT security has changed over the years in that items such as data security, IT security, and physical security are now seen as just components of a total security solution. Enterprise security is a framework for applying comprehensive controls designed to protect a company while mapping key services to needed information systems. Software‐defined networking (SDN) is a new technology that allows network professionals to virtualize the network so that control is decoupled from hardware and given to a software application called a controller. Software‐defined networking overcomes this roadblock because it allows networking professionals to respond to the dynamic needs of modern networks.","","9781119477716","10.1002/9781119575948.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822870.pdf&bkn=9820830&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Cloud computing;Virtualization;Information security;Companies;Switches;Data security","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

WBAN uses reasonable number of sensor devices on human body to provide the facility of monitoring the patient health condition by the doctors from remote places. Also these systems help the doctors to go for continuous assessment on patient's critical medical information. WBAN allows the doctors to make immediate decision toward treating the patients in the emergency situations. The limited size of the sensor devices and also their limited transmission capability restricts the wireless body area network to NOT to have fixed requirements on energy constraints and reliable data transmission. Hence, it is essential to have mechanism to ensure the extended life time of the network and reliable data transmission. By considering these notable issues in the wireless body are networks, this chapter aims to propose an approach for effective network design to extend the network life time by minimizing the energy consumption and enhance the packet delivery ratio.In this chapter, an energy‐efficient and reliable network model is proposed for medical care and patient health monitoring scenario, and this model considers the design characteristics of three layers, which includes physical, MAC, and network layers. An efficient heuristic scheduling approach, which causes low overhead on coordinator and sensor nodes, is proposed and attains less outage rate than fixed and other opportunistic scheduling schemes. Here, the proposed opportunistic scheduling approach is derived from the combination of two state Markov chain models – Gilbert model.","","9781119438991","10.1002/9781119439004.ch18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821436.pdf&bkn=9820809&pdfType=chapter","","Wireless communication;Body area networks;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks;Servers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Flaus","Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France","Cybersecurity of Industrial Systems","","2019","","","91","120","In general, an industrial control system is subject to threats, generated by sources of threats. These sources of threats use an attack vector to carry out an attack. A complete threat assessment for an information system reveals threats other than those linked to computer attacks. External threats must use other vectors of attack, such as the Internet, or social engineering. A primary attack can also generate a secondary attack, the objective of the primary attack being to install malware that can be used as a relay for other attacks. A logical bomb is a category of malware that installs itself in a hidden way, in a Trojan horse for example, and triggers actions at a date predefined by the hackers. A cross‐site scripting attack is a type of attack in which an attacker injects data, such as a malicious script, into content from trusted websites.","","9781119644514","10.1002/9781119644538.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822814.pdf&bkn=9820857&pdfType=chapter","","Integrated circuits;Authentication;Performance evaluation;NIST;Information systems;Servers;Safety","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

That technique broke a variety of other academic and commercial algorithms that we all thought secure. We learned better in the early 1990s, and now design algorithms to be resistant to that technique. It's very probable that the NSA has newer techniques that remain undiscovered in academia.

This chapter analyzes variations of PISA scores from 2003 to 2012 in France and Germany for mathematics literacy through a multiplicative model whose choice of parameters was introduced by Zighera in 1985. In particular, Zighera's method is shown to highlight evolution in the sociodemographic composition of the sampled population that may affect the observed evolution of performance of students. Generally speaking, analysis of connections between qualitative variables essentially contributes to the understanding of a sociodemographic process. Its main interest consists of identifying whether two or several characteristics of a population are dependent or not, according to complex relations of causality. Usually, adjustment of the distribution with fixed marginals to the reference distribution is obtained by minimization of Kullback‐Leibler divergence (KLD).","","9781119579649","10.1002/9781119579465.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822607.pdf&bkn=9820831&pdfType=chapter","","Statistics;Sociology;Testing;Mathematical models;Pupils;Analytical models;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

One example of risk evaluation is “war gaming” cyber, via modeling and simulation (M&S). This chapter provides an end‐to‐end process for translating interview data to failure rate “models” used to estimate vulnerability for a system of interest, providing an enterprise cyber risk estimate at one instant in time. The opacity of cyberattack/exploit data therefore presents a counting problem for developing model‐based approaches.

The risk is that a hacker sitting in the back of the plane, or even one on the ground, could use the Wi‐Fi connection to hack into the avionics and then remotely fly the plane.The report doesn't explain how someone could do this, and there are currently no known vulnerabilities that a hacker could exploit.

When you run GPresult /h and look at the settings report, it tells you which GPO “wins” and the settings therein. In MDM‐land, this is (today) not really possible by walking up to some affected machine and just checking on the client side. Yes, the Advanced MDM report tells you the final setting, which is nice. But there doesn't seem to be any way to say, “Oh, you got the Edge Homepage setting from MDM Profile ‘My Test Settings.’” This is a bummer, because when you have a lot of profiles and possibly lots of settings within them, and then you have conflicts, that's going to make troubleshooting just that much harder if you only have access to the machine with the conflict.","","9781119564348","10.1002/9781119564362.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823330.pdf&bkn=9820825&pdfType=chapter","","Operating systems;Writing;Web pages;Software development management;Engines;Browsers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This is an aspect that faces a number of challenges, stemming not only from the technical difficulties and peculiarities, but equally covers the interaction with an emerging line of businesses offering cloud storage and services. Typically, in order to acquire data in the Cloud environments, digital investigators should firstly locate relevant Cloud's data centres. However, hosting provider cannot be trusted with details of the involved computer host. Indeed, law enforcement members need to understand the essential requirements, governance related to the Cloud service providers. Finally, efficient approach and techniques for forensic acquisition and analysis data in the Cloud platforms are still missing. Therefore, in this chapter, we present different aspects related to the challenges of data acquisition in the Cloud. We describe firstly legal perspectives related to Cloud service providers. Next, we also discuss on how to locate the data centre where the computer host of the investigators interest is running and we also propose an efficient approach to tackle this challenge. Finally, we show a forensic acquisition and analysis of a popular Cloud storage platform: Amazon web service. Our approaches are also experimented with real‐world scenarios.","","9781119053408","10.1002/9781119053385.ch13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821318.pdf&bkn=9820795&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Data centers;Law enforcement;Servers;Forensics;Internet;Companies","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

These are supposed to be consumer devices, not specialized equipment for security experts only. This sort of thing is true in other aspects of society, and we have a variety of mechanisms to deal with it. Government regulation is one of them.Computer security has resisted these mechanisms, both because the industry changes so quickly and because this sort of testing is hard and expensive. But the effect is that we're all being sold a lot of insecure consumer products with embedded computers. And as these computers get connected to the Internet, the problems will get worse.

Indeed, technological innovations, such as intelligent mobile phones and intelligent social networks, are emerging day after day and affecting our life. We use these “connected objects” on a daily basis, so we begin to talk about a connected world. The data resulting from this technological explosion over the last two decades exceed all the data that have been produced since the beginning of human civilization. The enormous volume of data is not the only concern. These data are so diverse and occur at very high frequencies as traditional database management systems. The entire world is affected by this revolution and data explosion, and the medical and health institutions are not an exception. Medical data are produced in significant volumes and rates, and the health sector has also undergone a technological upheaval. Indeed, the use of new communication technologies allows us to create a link between doctors and patients in a clear and direct way. On the other hand, the use of social networks in healthcare presents many challenges, including security and the protection of patient's privacy. Since medical data are very sensitive and contain personal information, a loss or divulgation can seriously damage both the private and professional lives of doctors and patients in addition to the organization's reputation. Moreover, the nature of the health sector, which involves several stakeholders in the business process, increases the risk related to patient safety and privacy, such as disclosure of data to other parties that do not necessarily have the same idea about the importance of medical data security. Many healthcare managers are working effectively to use social media to engage patients and consumers. Through effective marketing and communication tactics, organizations can veer away from traditional advertising techniques and use the Internet to connect with consumers in the healthcare field. Consumers rely heavily on information found online and use the Internet to gather information about healthcare and connect with other patients to get support and know the same conditions. Others use these resources for research or to share experiences with healthcare providers and other related organizations. Patients also seek information through social media that select physicians, specialists, and hospitals to make informed decisions about the best practices for seeking care. Individuals will use social media to publish reviews or other comments that support others from choosing this type of healthcare in the future. It is essential that providers be active on social networks and provide the appropriate accurate information for seekers. To use these communication platforms in healthcare, we must ensure the safety and privacy of patients and doctors who use social networks as a means of communication and data sharing. In order to compensate the inadequacies of protection technics already existing in social networks, a new security approach based on “honeypots” can be adopted to preserve the privacy of profiles linked to healthcare. This approach can detect malicious profiles and malicious content shared between illegitimate users and legitimate users in social networks and directly influence the data shared between the doctor and the patient. IT security experts are studying these threats to implement new solutions. Among the strategies used are honeypots, which are tools adapted to observe attacker's behavior. Honeypot is a technique widely used in network security and detection of malicious profiles in social networks. A honeypot is a computer system that is deliberately vulnerable to one or more vulnerabilities and is designed to attract attackers in order to study their behavior. There are several categories, low or high interaction, depending on the level of interaction proposed to hackers. They allow the collection of data from real processes, which are essential to establish realistic assumptions about the attacker's behavior. Recently, honeypots are also used to fight malicious behavior on the most popular social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. This type of honeypots is called “social honeypots.” To preserve the value of the community and ensure long‐term success, the proposed approach is based on the use of social honeypots to discover malicious profiles in social networks. The main ideas of the approach are as follows: ‐ The deployment of social honeypots to collect information about malicious profiles. ‐ Analyzing the characteristics of these malicious profiles and honeypots deployed to create classifiers that filter existing profiles and control new profiles. Inspired by security researchers who have used honeypots to observe and analyze malicious activities in networks, this method uses social honeypots to trap users so that the profiles that are detected by honeypots have a high probability of being a malicious profile. Using the proposed approach, we can monitor the activity of malicious profiles using social honeypots. Social honeypots are defined as systems that monitor the behavior of attackers and provide access to their information (for example, their profiles). This chapter will introduce the concept of social networking security in relation to healthcare and then outline a security approach to detect malicious profiles that share malicious content in order to steal personal information from patients and doctors.","","9781119438991","10.1002/9781119439004.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821182.pdf&bkn=9820809&pdfType=chapter","","Social networking (online);Medical services;Security;Internet;Organizations;Statistics;Sociology","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

GCP is a public cloud service that offers some of the same technologies used by Google to deliver its own products. Public cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft offer a range of services for deploying computing, storage, networking, and other infrastructures to run a wide array of business services and applications. Some cloud users are new companies that start in the cloud. They have never owned their own hardware and software. Other cloud customers are enterprises with multiple data centers that use public clouds to supplement their data centers. These different kinds of users have different requirements. A company that starts on the cloud can choose services that best fi t its application and architectural needs without having to consider existing infrastructure. For example, a startup could use GCP's Cloud Identity and Access Management services for all authentication and authorization needs.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821652.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Containers;File systems;Operating systems;Companies;Serverless computing;Engines","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In the cloud, the traditional forensic focus of acquiring and analyzing snapshots of digital artifacts becomes significantly less relevant as many of the artifacts are ephemeral, while the history of state changes become pervasive. Thus, over the medium‐to‐long term, the task of forensically reconstructing prior events will become easier as a growing fraction of the relevant information will be explicitly recorded. However, in the short term, the shift to cloud computing necessitates a paradigm change for forensic acquisition and processing tools from primarily artifact‐centric to primarily log‐centric.

Auditing is even more vital and complex in cloud computing environments due to non‐transparent architectures, multi‐tenancy, rapid elasticity, forensics challenges, and missing security, privacy and trust. Researchers have demonstrated that traditional IT auditing solutions are not yet flexible enough and ready to solve cloud‐based security issues, leading to immense problems for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) in offering secure and trusted services. CSPs must meet national and international IT compliance regulations, which are even more challenging in cloud infrastructures. This chapter discusses the current security and privacy challenges in cloud computing, how cloud‐auditing methodologies can help alleviate some of these issues, and how cloud auditing is evolving. It also covers the current cloud compliance regulations, and describes how global organizations are working together to develop compliance regulations specifically for cloud computing.","","9781119053408","10.1002/9781119053385.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821429.pdf&bkn=9820795&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Security;Forensics;Cloud computing security;Standards organizations;Privacy;Hardware","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The issue with intrusion detection systems (IDSes) as monitoring sensors is that they often produce thousands of alerts daily that should be dealt with by administrators manually. To provide situational awareness, detection systems usually employ (alert, priority) mappings that are either built in the IDS without consideration of the high‐level mission objectives of the infrastructure, or manually defined by administrators through a time‐consuming task that requires deep system‐level expertise. In this chapter, we discuss main challenges in providing Cloud infrastructural situational awareness as well as online security evaluation techniques that translates low‐level IDS alerts into a high‐level system security measure and provides a ranking of past malicious events and affected system assets based on how crucial they are for the organization. These techniques significantly reduce the human involvement by automatically learning system characteristics, providing a simple formalism for administrators to define the security requirements.","","9781119053408","10.1002/9781119053385.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821316.pdf&bkn=9820795&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Measurement;Organizations;Web servers;Databases;Cloud computing;Risk management","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The Intune Connector enabled an administrator to keep using their on‐prem SCCM console and perform the same tasks as if they had simply logged onto Microsoft Intune and done it in that other console. And Microsoft called this the hybrid design. Co‐management turns the initial rules on its ear. Instead of actively blocking registration of a device in SCCM and Intune (at the same time), as well as Active Directory (with Group Policy), now they are downright permitting and encouraging it. The idea and rationale to enable co‐management came to Microsoft after they realized that organizations simply wouldn't “jump” from all their entrenched on‐prem solutions (primarily SCCM) over to Intune (or any MDM). And the idea is that co‐management is a way to first connect “all the wires” from Windows 10 to your on‐prem systems and also to your MDM system. Then, over time, decide which workloads will be handled by what technology. Co‐management has quite a few steps to go through to get enabled if you've got an existing on‐prem SCCM infrastructure.","","9781119564348","10.1002/9781119564362.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822463.pdf&bkn=9820825&pdfType=chapter","","Operating systems;Connectors;Wires;Terminology;Graphics;Turning;Task analysis","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It is a vital part of your organization's business logic. Due care and due diligence both require it. (ISC) 2 and others define the incident response framework as a formal plan or process for managing the organization's response to a suspected information security incident. It consists of a series of steps that start with detection and run through response, mitigation, reporting, recovery, and remediation, ending with a lessons learned and onward preparation phase. Senior leadership and management may also have notification and reporting responsibilities of their own, which may include very short time frames in which notification must be given to regulatory authorities, or even the public.

These pervasive devices produce enormous data, which creates concern for both secure storing and data processing. This can be achieved by storing them in the cloud. In telemedicine, a huge volume of medical data is generated via various sensors and also through hospitals. The generated medical data are used by different persons with varied accessibility. Hence these sensitive medical data should be secured. Further, a disease prediction system is required to predict the probability of getting diabetes by observing various conditions or symptoms of persons. So, a secure medical data analytics and prediction (SMDAP) system, which secures the medical data in the cloud and analyze and predict the diseases, is proposed. The proposed SMDAP has proxy re‐encryption algorithm (PRA) designed to secure medical data while storing in the cloud. To provide the best possible treatment, it is necessary to cluster the patients. Hybrid particle swarm optimization K‐means (HPSO‐K) algorithm is applied on the medical data to cluster and discover similar medical data based on the symptoms in order to identify and segregate the patients. After clustering the data, hidden Markov model‐based Viterbi algorithm (HMM‐VA) is proposed to find the likelihood of a person to suffer from diabetes. The system is compared with existing mechanism to analyze the performance in terms of proxy re‐encryption, clustering mechanism, and prediction.","","9781119438991","10.1002/9781119439004.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821489.pdf&bkn=9820809&pdfType=chapter","","Hidden Markov models;Medical services;Cloud computing;Diabetes;Sensors;Sensor systems;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

IT security is like many other technology fields in that things change rapidly. Today, antivirus programs are just part of the protection needed to defend against digital threats. A CASP+ must perform vulnerability research and stay abreast of current security trends. Such research can help identify weaknesses and alert administrators before a network is attacked. Research can also help in identifying and correcting potential security problems before they become worse. Many security professionals may be focused on technical security controls, but policies, procedures, practices, and guidelines are also important. A policy that does not implement good administrative security can be as damaging as a misconfigured firewall. The IT security industry has grown to require more from these devices.

The specific points of operational safety concern how to measure risks and how to quantify protection systems with a Safety Integrity Level (SIL) in order to reach a given level of risk. The approaches used in operational safety and cybersecurity are similar and must be conducted jointly. Indeed, to ensure the overall proper functioning of a system, it appears that the risk analysis carried out in relation to the different types of hazards (technical, human or organizational) must be supplemented by an analysis of the risks associated with cyber‐attacks for elements containing programmed devices. This chapter presents important concepts in the operational safety approach, such as the SIL, the main lines of standard IES 61508 and the main risk analysis methods.","","9781119644514","10.1002/9781119644538.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823100.pdf&bkn=9820857&pdfType=chapter","","Safety;Computer security;Law;Electric breakdown;Time measurement;IEC Standards;Temperature measurement","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Application testing is an important part of IT security. Application security testing is the process of using software, hardware, and procedural methods to prevent security flaws in applications and protect them from exploit. As a CASP+, you are not expected to be an expert programmer or understand the inner workings of a C++ program. What the CASP+ must understand, however, is the importance of application security, how to work with programmers during the development of code, and the role of testing code for proper security controls. Security by design means that the security measures are built‐in and that security code reviews must be carried out to uncover potential security problems during the early stages of the development process. The longer the delay in this process will result the greater the cost to fix the problem. Cross‐site scripting (XSS) attacks are an application issue that is caused by an injection problem.

Couretas",NA,"An Introduction to Cyber Modeling and Simulation","","2019","","","1","7","This chapter expresses that cyber‐attacks have continued since 1988, with effects that range from data collection to controlling critical infrastructure. It provides a mix of documented cyber incidents, with only the Morris Worm in question, as to malevolent intent. Cyber risk assessment is a growing area of interest, and an inspiration for developing cyber modeling and simulation techniques. In addition to profile of commercial cyber activity, military applications are expanding as well, with notable uses in Estonia and Georgia over the last decade. The chapter also provides a template to examine the policy, training, and technology options of a cyber‐attacked state. Cyber's overarching use has implications across both a country's business systems and its supporting civil infrastructure. Real‐world cyber scenarios then use the assessments of the business systems, as baselines, to represent both the scope and scale of networks with technologies and configurations that can easily span multiple generations of information technology.","","9781119420811","10.1002/9781119420842.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821194.pdf&bkn=9820806&pdfType=chapter","","Computer crime;Organizations;Law;Resilience;Internet;Personnel;Grippers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide","","2019","","","425","462","This Chapter offers information on the Stackdriver, a GCP service for resource monitoring, logging, tracing, and debugging. Stackdriver is a service for collecting performance metrics, logs, and event data from our resources. Metrics include measurements such as the average percent CPU utilization over the past minute and the number of bytes written to a storage device in the last minute. Metrics are defined measurements on a resource collected at regular intervals. Metrics return aggregate values, such as the maximum, minimum, or average value of the item measured, which could be CPU utilization, amount of memory used, or number of bytes written to a network interface. Stackdriver Monitoring allows you to define alerts on metrics, such as CPU utilization, so that you can be notified if part of your infrastructure is not performing as expected. Stackdriver Logging collects, stores, and manages log entries. Log data that needs to be stored more than 30 days can be exported to Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Cloud Pub/Sub. Cloud Trace provides distributed tracing services to identify slow‐running parts of code. Cloud Debug provides for creating snapshots of running code and injecting log messages without altering source code.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822737.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Monitoring;Measurement;Costs;Pricing;Engines;Calculators;Web services","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Cyber modeling and simulation (M&S) benefits from a long line of situational awareness (SA) research, much of it used to develop aircraft training programs, and currently available for cybersecurity training development. Complementing the underwriters laboratory (UL) analog for cyber system access estimation is the cyber threat data providers' tactical and strategic outlook for current trends in system attack practices. The network defense trainer (NDT) cyber tools and ranges provide an engine for representing a cyberattack, and this engine uses the network protocols and standards appropriate to these tools. Evaluating technology via physical security analogs provides an opportunity for the modeler to validate candidate cyber models.

Every element of your organization's IT systems runs on or with hardware, firmware, software, and data made by someone else, modified by someone else, and maintained or supported by someone else. Its parts and subsystems elements, layer by layer, come into being through long and complex value chains of organizations that buy and sell parts and subsystems from each other; they buy rights to chip‐level or board‐level design information. Many larger organizations form strategic partnerships with their top‐tier suppliers and services providers to form a trusted supply chain. The trusted supply chain is an ancient concept it may have originated in early agrarian societies that first used futures contracts to ensure sufficient grain production to meet bakers' needs. Each trusted supply chain has a set of values it seeks to protect, whether that is socially acceptable practices, environmentally friendly production, sustainability, or quality, safety, and reliability.","","9781119542957","10.1002/9781119547921.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822823.pdf&bkn=9820816&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Security;Hardware;Supply chains;Software;Safety;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Very often, vulnerability analysis of an industrial control system (ICS) is limited to a technical aspect. This chapter presents a generic approach to analyze the vulnerabilities of an ICS. These systems offer a number of potential entry points, which define the attack surface, and which are useful to know in order to implement the appropriate measures. The generic attack surface of an ICS is shown in the chapter. It shows intrusion points, targets and measurements. Before presenting the most exhaustive list of ICS's vulnerabilities, the chapter presents the vulnerabilities that are most often identified during the analyses. Finally, the chapter presents the vulnerabilities of conventional industrial systems and Industrial Internet of Things systems and methodological or technical tools to analyze the vulnerability of an ICS system.","","9781119644514","10.1002/9781119644538.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822696.pdf&bkn=9820857&pdfType=chapter","","Integrated circuits;Trojan horses;Maintenance engineering;Buildings;Workstations;Process control;Industrial Internet of Things","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Will Fake News Kill Information?","D. Augey; M. Alcaraz",NA; NA,"Digital Information Ecosystems: Smart Press","","2019","","","139","159","Fake news has all the more impact because the public likes to believe in conspiracy theories. Although ""misinformation"" is old, social networks have amplified the phenomenon so much that fake news may have led to tragedies. Most social networks have implemented initiatives to try to fight against fake news. Misinformation circulates extremely quickly. More precisely, six times faster than real information. Kshetri and Voas propose an economic model that analyzes the value of fake news. An individual engages in the distribution of fake news if the benefits they receive from it seem to have a value greater than the disadvantages to them.

It is important to know that the preferred way of assigning permissions to users, groups, and service accounts is through the IAM system. However, Google Cloud did not always have IAM. Before that, permissions were granted using what are now known as primitive roles, which are fairly coarse‐grained. Primitive roles may have more permissions than you want an identity to have. You can constrain permissions using scopes. The set of operations that an instance can perform is determined by the scopes assigned and the roles assigned to a service account used by the instance. IAM provides predefined roles. These roles are grouped by service. The roles are designed to provide the minimal set of permissions needed to carry out a logical task, such as writing to a bucket or deploying an App Engine application. When predefined roles do not meet your needs, you can define custom roles.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822022.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Engines;Task analysis;Navigation;Internet;Codes;Access control;Documentation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter lists five ideas that form the backbone of cybersecurity: authentication, data integrity, nonrepudiation, availability, and confidentiality. All transactions can be simplified to two or more entities needing to communicate, understand, and accept the information. It could be a military order, a banking transaction, a request for a contract, or a major engagement between two businesses. These communications can be considered in four dimensions: to communicate, to exploit (access) the communications, to defend the communications, and finally, to degrade or destroy the communications. The chapter also explains a security verification ecosystem where certified third‐party brokerages can assert, identify, verify, and extend trust. These brokers will become the backbone of the interconnected ecosystems that people all work and live in by arranging higher levels of trust that enable them to take advantage of applications and services that now span environments.","","9781119617389","10.1002/9781119617396.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822179.pdf&bkn=9820847&pdfType=chapter","","Authentication;Security;Codes;Internet;Computer security;Hardware;Optical fiber networks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Moskowitz",NA,"MDM: Fundamentals, Security, and the Modern Desktop: Using Intune, Autopilot, and Azure to Manage, Deploy, and Secure Windows 10","","2019","","","1","13","This chapter explores the essentials of MDM and explains the concept of Enterprise Mobility. MDM is the name we give the moving part of the endpoint to receive settings and perform work. But underneath it all, on the endpoint, there are protocols and moving parts that do the actual work. Group Policy uses Kerberos and SMB to coordinate its efforts of authenticating a user or computer, then downloading directives. MDM uses a much lighter weight system based upon XML. The protocol is called OMA‐DM (sometimes spelled out as OMA DM). This is an open standard protocol. The OMA part stands for Open Mobile Alliance. And the DM part stands for Device Management. OMA‐DM deals with the joining aspect of a machine to an MDM system, which is properly known as enrollment. And OMA‐DM deals with sending messages down in real time, say, to deliver a new policy via push, gather its status, or perform a remote wipe. Even though all MDM services are limited to using the same CSPs, it's possible for an MDM service (or anyone really) to extend Windows management in some other way and use MDM as the transport for doing so. For instance, MobileIron has a paid add‐on product called MobileIron Bridge that is a fancy way of deploying PowerShell scripts. It simply uses the MDM's built‐in CSP for deploying MSI files and, then, drops a PowerShell script on the machine and has a little “runner program” to execute the PowerShell scripts.","","9781119564348","10.1002/9781119564362.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823334.pdf&bkn=9820825&pdfType=chapter","","Operating systems;Program processors;Portable computers;Passwords;Blogs;Servers;Internet of Things","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The use of “models”, for cyber decision support spans from longer‐term decision support, in categorizing projected network events, to real‐time visualization of developing threats, and using these models to analyze attack graphs and projected second‐ and third‐order effects for each course of action (COA) candidate. M&S, in decision support systems (DSS), can enhance situational awareness (SA) through training. In addition to analyzing mission impacts of cyber actions, AMICA, MITRE developed “Crown Jewels Analysis” (CJA), a process for identifying the cyber assets most critical to the accomplishment of an organization's mission. In addition to CJA, the cyber mission impact assessment (CMIA) is one approach for performing a cyber mission risk assessment.

Cryptography is an important tool for protecting information in computer systems. It is used to protect data transmitted in computer networks and data stored in long‐term storage. Despite its enormous success, cryptography is difficult to deploy correctly in practice. Even an error that leaks a small amount of information can be exploited by an attacker and result in a complete break. The chapter explores why cryptography is so hard to get right and ways to address this. It looks at some common mistakes and ways in which cryptography often fails in practice. Generally speaking, failures fall into one of three categories: mistakes in the design; mistakes in the implementation; and side‐channel attacks where the system is compromised by an attacker that measures side information.","","9781119617389","10.1002/9781119617396.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823035.pdf&bkn=9820847&pdfType=chapter","","Cryptography;Encryption;Quantum computing;Computers;Data protection;Computer crime;Technological innovation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It is ironic that, to effectively protect an information system that rises from a binary code of ones and zeros, people too often convey black or white choices between security and privacy. Successfully securing our networks depends on finding the right balance between these two forces. As the central role of security becomes more of an accepted truism in the daily reality of doing business, there will be progressively less space between IT and information security. The result of this convergent evolution will be to introduce sound privacy practices that may be new and may seem cumbersome to some industries, but these practices have long been the accepted principles we live by in financial services. Hopefully, through the process of compliance, they will come to understand that greater privacy regulations lead to more effective information security, practices, and techniques.","","9781119617389","10.1002/9781119617396.ch13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822214.pdf&bkn=9820847&pdfType=chapter","","Privacy;Regulation;Law;Europe;General Data Protection Regulation;Technological innovation;Task analysis","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Healthcare monitoring systems provides a way to monitor the changes closely in human vital signs and gives information to maintain optimal health status, alerting the physician when something goes serious. So there is an increased usage of healthcare monitoring system. This chapter discusses the components required for the healthcare monitoring system. The sensors have the ability to collect significant data about the health condition of the body and thus enabling the introduction of wireless body area networks (WBANs). The nodes in WBAN have the capability of healthcare monitoring like blood pressure, EEG, pulse rate, body sugar, body temperature, etc. The information collected will be transferred to the physician at regular interval of time. The main concern regarding wireless communication channel for healthcare monitoring is the privacy and security of the patient information and control flow. HHealthcare monitoring requires strict necessities for privacy, security, and reliability. Privacy and security of health information has essentially focused on the attacks on the wireless communication channel of the devices and also the health information in online. In this chapter, we pursue different methods to preserve the privacy and secure of the health information. The various types of information that leak from the human body naturally need to compromise privacy. The information transferred and stored in WBANs plays a major role in the healthcare monitoring and treatment. So it is crucial to guarantee the security for the patient information. Lack of security in WBANs is a major issue that hamper the acceptance of the technology. Sometimes it may result in life‐critical events or even death. But it is necessary to provide a scalable security and privacy mechanism to malicious attacks is difficult. The open nature of patient data is susceptible to eavesdropping, alteration, and loss of data. Even though WBAN has many open issues like communication, computation memory capacity, material, regulatory, low power, interference, quality of service, and energy efficiency, its main concern is privacy and security. Privacy and security needs are categorized based on the data access, network communication and data storage. This chapter also discusses about the various types of attacks and how they are classified. It also gives an insight about the issues that need to be considered while planning for privacy and security mechanism for WBANs. Internet of things (IoT) provides an excellent and unseen network that can be sensed, controlled, and coded. The IoT‐based products has the embedded technology that permits the exchange of data with other devices or the Internet. It provides a different and better reformed heath care monitoring system. IoT again serves on sensors, gateway, and wireless communication network that allow communicating and accessing the information. It also discusses about WBAN using IoT to provide solutions for healthcare monitoring and investigates privacy and security issues in IoT healthcare monitoring.","","9781119438991","10.1002/9781119439004.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821158.pdf&bkn=9820809&pdfType=chapter","","Monitoring;Medical services;Temperature measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Temperature sensors","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter proposes a very simple and very low budget systematic sampling plan for the estimation of the coefficients A, B, C, D, E and H of the polynomial f(x, y) = (Ax2 + By2 + Cxy+ Dx + Ey + H)−1, which is sometimes found to be a probability density function. Five different three‐point measurements of pollutant concentration over a field have been recorded. The inverse values of a function measuring pollutant concentration obeying five restrictions are presented. The proposed sampling plan can be characterized as a low‐budget sampling because of the small sample size. It is advantageous because it can be applied to detect point‐source pollutants and point‐source radiation, and thus determine risk assessment in public health.","","9781119597575","10.1002/9781119597568.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822026.pdf&bkn=9820840&pdfType=chapter","","1/f noise;Estimation;Data analysis;Systematics;Pollution;Mathematical models;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Alcaraz",NA; NA,"Digital Information Ecosystems: Smart Press","","2019","","","35","54","Despite the proliferation of fake news, and despite repeated violent attacks against journalists, including from journalists themselves but also regularly from politicians, several surveys show that the French have a certain attachment to traditional media. On the contrary, the Internet is continuing to arouse a certain amount of mistrust: only one in four French people consider the information it contains to be credible, according to the media trust barometer of the La Croix newspaper. Economic research focuses on the functioning of a press whose owners are most often private shareholders. Media strategy is based on readers' beliefs and behaviors. The most commonly used approach to highlight the existence of bias is to rely on an econometric analysis of content according to its political positioning. Content econometrics seems to show that most media adopt an editorial line that includes a choice that is favorable to an ideological movement and/or to politicians.","","9781119579731","10.1002/9781119579717.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823101.pdf&bkn=9820832&pdfType=chapter","","Media;Presses;Social networking (online);Economics;Barometers;Internet;Journalism","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Argument mining in debates, mediation, deliberations and other oral forms of this type is in general carried out from transcripts. As a consequence, at the moment, oral transcriptions remain relatively imperfect and partial. Argumentation analysis carried out from these transcriptions should therefore be made with care. Besides media, other visual elements are crucial in argumentation. For example, when arguing for a product, its packaging, the colors that are used and even the shape of the package are all important, in particular for food products. Non‐verbal aspects can have a major influence on argument strength. A sound, music extract or a visual element may reinforce a support or an attack if it has the same tone: positive for supports, negative for attacks.","","9781119671169","10.1002/9781119507291.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822761.pdf&bkn=9820811&pdfType=chapter","","Visualization;Cameras;Buildings;Rhetoric;Media;Linguistics;TV","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Over the past eight years, everyone has learned from the latest research in advertising manipulation. Their data can better determine your political affiliation, and level of engagement, than ever before. You'll see personalized ads precisely targeted to your interests and opinions, based on the things you've written and articles you've read. There are hundreds of companies that collect data about you and your behavior, online and offline, primarily for advertising purposes. Those companies categorize you by dozens of different variables and sell your information to companies that want to sell things to you.Every candidate's goal is, essentially, to selectively manipulate the visibility of that icon. They're going to want to make sure their supporters see the icon a lot, and that the supporters of every other candidate don't see it at all. Similarly, they are going to want to buy advertising space on Google to display positive links for themselves and negative links for their rivals. Research also shows that public pressure and even shame increases voter turnout.","","9781119643463","10.1002/9781119653554.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822572.pdf&bkn=9820866&pdfType=chapter","","Voting;Social networking (online);Advertising;Cyberattack;Internet;Companies;Interference","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Significant loss of vision due to diabetic retinopathy can be profoundly prevented with proper screening and medication at an earlier stage. The evaluating procedure comprises of perceiving fine points of interest, for example, microaneurysms, to some greater elements, for example, exudates, and some of the time their position in respect to each other on pictures of the eye. Our task here is to classify these images based on before mentioned points of interest. For each of the images, we classify them into one of the five categories. Our five categories (classes) are, namely, normal, mild non‐prolific diabetic retinopathy, moderate non‐prolific diabetic retinopathy, severe non‐prolific diabetic retinopathy, and prolific diabetic retinopathy. We are using convolutional neural networks for our prediction model, and we train our model on GPU, which is much faster than training on CPIU. GPU‐accelerated library of primitives aimed at deep neural networks; NVIDIA CUDA deep neural network (cuDNN) is used in our model. We train our model with 35 100 retinal images. Our model has around 85% of accuracy when tested on 53 576 retinal images. Mean sensitivity and specificity of our model is 94% and 95%, when we consider only binary classes, i.e. normal and prolific diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Our solution is elegant and automated, saving a lot of time and manual efforts. Nowadays, with evolution of machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are able to create very intelligent systems compared to a few years back. When we apply machine learning to pervasive computing systems, they would work far more intelligently than they are currently. Moreover, pervasive systems play an important role in healthcare systems as they can be used to monitor various kinds of health conditions. Especially, when we consider the aging society, it would be very supportive for them as they might be facing various age‐related health problems like diabetes, thyroid, visual impairment, vitamin deficiency, etc. Pervasive systems with machine learning applied in to it will help to learn and analyze the health of a particular individual suffering from any healthcare condition such as diabetic retinopathy in aging diabetics. CUDA‐based deep neural network has been proven to be very successful in detecting it at a very early stage using just the retinal images of the patients. Hence, machine learning, when applied to pervasive systems, may prove to be a boon in various healthcare conditions faced by the society nowadays. The contributions of the proposed work are that (i) it reduces the time complexity, (ii) system accepts the input image of any size with similar time complexity, and (iii) to the best of knowledge, CUDA‐based detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal images is not attempted by other researchers.","","9781119438991","10.1002/9781119439004.ch17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821402.pdf&bkn=9820809&pdfType=chapter","","Retina;Training;Diabetes;Graphics processing units;Retinopathy;Neural networks;Deep learning","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

For many security professionals, the words “enterprise security” might immediately bring to mind thoughts of firewalls, intrusion detection, and other hardware devices; however true, security requires more than the purchase of hardware. IT governance is important because the CASP+ cannot do the job of security alone. Good security practices and principles start at the top of an organization. Corporate governance is the system an organization has in place for overall control and management of the organization, processes, customs, and policies. A clear division of roles, responsibilities, and disciplines must exist within an organization. Each discipline, including employees, consultants, and vendors, should be subject to the company's security policy. As a CASP+, you may be tasked with interpreting security requirements and goals to communicate with stakeholders from other disciplines. Maintaining compliance when any of these changes occur requires that security responsibilities be distributed throughout the organization and that layers of control exist. Specific security processes should also be assigned to individuals who are assigned to unique roles.","","9781119477716","10.1002/9781119575948.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823237.pdf&bkn=9820830&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Standards;Companies;Process control;Encryption;Collaboration;Wrapping","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Modeling real cyber phenomena usually requires some level of abstraction. While logical ranges provide the means for emulating systems of interest, modeling and simulation (M&S) frameworks are still a necessary ingredient to provide the scale and scope to model contemporary cyber systems. Combining knowledge‐based systems engineering (KBSE) with the behavioral simulation common to agent‐ based modeling has the potential for a comprehensive approach to cyber M&S. Leveraging a uniform system description results in a reproducible framework for cyberattack modeling and impact assessment. Model‐based systems engineering (MBSE) is evolving from the software development community, currently being used for overall systems development. Modeling the enterprise computer systems with cyber security modeling language (CySeMoL) allows the inference engine to assess the success probability of candidate system attacks.","","9781119420811","10.1002/9781119420842.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821252.pdf&bkn=9820806&pdfType=chapter","","Unified modeling language;Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Data models;Systems engineering and theory;Behavioral sciences","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter analyzes the respect of grouping property for several methods used to quantify the relative importance of predictors through decomposition of the explained variance in linear regression. After being criticized by several authors, Correlation‐adjusted marginal correlation (CAR) scores have been recommended again as estimators of importance of predictors and presented with respect to the grouping property. The chapter shows that CAR scores actually do not respect this property. It explains, in turn, why some other variance decomposition methods do respect grouping property and formulates recommendations for quantifying the relative importance of predictors. It is important to note that variance decomposition should not be seen as a substitute for linear regression models, path analytical models and models based on theory‐driven explanations.","","9781119597575","10.1002/9781119597568.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822899.pdf&bkn=9820840&pdfType=chapter","","Automobiles;Linear regression;Matrix decomposition;Correlation;Predictive models;Covariance matrices;Singular value decomposition","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Wills",NA,"(ISC)2 SSCP Systems Security Certified Practitioner Official Study Guide","","2019","","","3","23","This chapter discusses how businesses use information to get work done and why that drives their needs for information security. It states that all businesses work by using ideas to transform one set of “inputs” into another set of “outputs”; they then provide or sell those outputs to their customers at a price that (ideally) more than pays for the cost of the inputs, pays everybody's wages, and pays a dividend back to the investors. That set of ideas is a key to what makes one business different from another. That initial set of ideas is perhaps the “secret sauce” recipe, the better mousetrap design, or simply being the first to recognize that one particular marketplace doesn't have anybody providing a certain product or service to its customers. Business logic is intellectual property. Successful businesses are the ones that can translate the hopes and dreams of their founders into solid, thoughtful business logic; and as we say, that investment in business logic can become the key to competitive advantage that a business can have in its chosen marketplace. Keeping that business logic safe and secure requires the due care and due diligence of all concerned including the SSCPs working with the business on its information systems.","","9781119542957","10.1002/9781119547921.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822688.pdf&bkn=9820816&pdfType=chapter","","Oral communication;Protocols;Information security;Reliability;Knowledge management;Standards organizations;Emergency services","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Cloud Functions is a serverless compute service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Cloud Functions is similar to App Engine in that they are both serverless. A primary difference, though, is that App Engine supports multiple services organized into a single application, while Cloud Functions supports individual services that are managed and operate independently of other services. App Engine is a good serverless option for web applications that have a front‐end user interface running in one service, a set of APIs running in one or more other services, and business logic running in another service. The services together make up the application, so it makes sense to treat them as a single managed unit. Not all computing requirements need multiple services. For example, your department may upload a daily data extract from a database, which is then loaded into an enterprise data warehouse.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822897.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Optical character recognition software;Python;Engines;Databases;Search problems;Data mining","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Good data scientists work to discover hidden insights in vast quantities of often disparate and often poor‐quality data. Great data scientists think about things differently. They are not simply interested in finding new insights in the data. They are interested in developing new insights about the larger world around them. Great data scientists embrace uncertainty. They recognize when a prediction rests on solid foundations and when it is merely wishful thinking. They are simply outstanding in describing what has to go right for the prediction to hold, what will really foul it up, and what are the unknowns that keep them awake at night. When they can, they quantify the uncertainty, and they are good at suggesting simple experiments to confirm or deny assumptions, reduce uncertainty, explore the next set of questions, etc.","","9781119570714","10.1002/9781119570790.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822685.pdf&bkn=9820828&pdfType=chapter","","Voting;Data science;Uncertainty;Silver;Data models;Noise measurement;Media","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Network scanning is a process of finding assets that are alive or have a heartbeat, communicating and then gathering as much vital information about those assets as possible. Network scanning can be divided into four stages: network mapping, open ports, services running, and operating systems. Network mapping uses a process to discover and visualize assets by actively probing them. Nmap sends TCP and UDP packets to a targeted machine. Zenmap is the graphical user interface of Nmap.

The first type of visibility that an enterprise needs on its network is visibility of devices, which itself requires understanding the underlying network and the dramatic changes that have occurred over the past decade. Having clear visibility of activity on the network can provide an enterprise with an extremely useful picture of potential threats, providing the data needed both for early warning of a potential threat and the information needed to quickly and efficiently remediate any issues that arise. Visibility on identity and access is in many ways a subset of visibility into activity on one's network. The network visibility framework fabric that a security team builds can be leveraged by the network team for troubleshooting, by the operations team to review performance, and for a range of other uses.","","9781119617389","10.1002/9781119617396.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821964.pdf&bkn=9820847&pdfType=chapter","","Computer crime;US Government;Terrorism;Servers;Printers;Ports (computers);Pathogens","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The book helps data scientists navigate the individual and organizational complexities. The key message is that the real work of data science focuses on solving important problems facing people, companies, and organizations while fully embracing the complexities, preconceptions, bad data, quirks of decision‐makers, and politics that go with them. This real work must be rooted in sound theory, or the solutions will not hold up for long. This combination touches on various domains, some methodological, technological, organizational, and personal. The book covers the nontechnical ones and explores the things data scientists are not usually taught in class, but that the giants of statistics knew were essential. Of course, solid analyses are essential, but it is other, more complex steps that data scientists must take to ensure their analyses are given their due, lead to good decisions, and produce results.","","9781119570714","10.1002/9781119570790.ch18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823070.pdf&bkn=9820828&pdfType=chapter","","Data science;Complexity theory;Industries;Games;Biological system modeling;Wool;Turning","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Communications security is about data in motion as it is going to and from the endpoints and the other elements or nodes of our systems, such as servers. Communications and network systems designers talk about protocol stacks as the layers or nested sets of different protocols that work together to define and deliver a set of services to users. An individual protocol or layer defines the specific characteristics, the form, features, and functions that make up that protocol or layer. The “stack” starts with the lowest level, usually the physical interconnect standard, and layers each successively higher‐level standard onto those below it. These higher‐level standards can go on almost forever; think of how “reverse the charges,” advanced billing features, or many caller ID features need to depend on lower‐level services being defined and working properly, and you've got the idea of a protocol stack.","","9781119542957","10.1002/9781119547921.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822660.pdf&bkn=9820816&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Protocols;Information security;Communication systems;Receivers;Convergence;Symbols","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Such segmentation places security where it is most needed: around the assets themselves. With the idea of inevitable breaches at the forefront, segmentation operates from the principle that it is critical to prevent unfettered access to all areas of a network. A well‐segmented network is an invisible masterpiece of teamwork and collaboration. There are three primary drivers of network segmentation. The first is to break a network down into smaller, more manageable segments. The next driver is to protect systems that may not be able to run with the same level of security or controls as others. The third big driver is that segmentation creates a cleaner environment, especially on larger networks. Building an effective segmentation strategy requires a lot of documentation of how and where data flows and how applications and systems connect and interact.","","9781119617389","10.1002/9781119617396.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821610.pdf&bkn=9820847&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Collaboration;Technological innovation;Wireless communication;Urban areas;Teamwork;Steel","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Tanner",NA,"Cybersecurity Blue Team Toolkit","","2019","","","43","55","In the vulnerability management lifecycle, building cybersecurity professionals' remediation attack plan is a critical step. After completing the asset classification and vulnerability assessment, they correlates the findings to compile their plan of action. Some organizations have a robust security policy where they require assets to be scanned at least once a week. The Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) is an open‐source framework of several tools and services that offers powerful vulnerability scanning and management systems. It is a competitor to the well‐known Nexpose or Nessus vulnerability scanning tool. Analyzing the results from tools like these is an excellent first step for an IT security team working to create a robust, fully developed picture of their network. These tools can also be used as part of a more mature IT platform that regularly assesses a corporate network for vulnerabilities and alerts IT professionals when a major change or new vulnerability has been introduced.","","9781119552956","10.1002/9781119552963.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821973.pdf&bkn=9820820&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Green products;Operating systems;Servers;Ports (computers);Open source software;NIST","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Firewalls can be hardware, software, or a combination of both. They are usually located at the demarcation line between trusted and untrusted network elements. Firewalls play a critical role in the separation of important assets. Firewall rules determine what type of traffic is inspected, what is allowed to pass, and what is blocked. The most basic way to configure firewall rules is by means of an access control list (ACL). An ACL is used for packet filtering and for selecting the types of traffic to be analyzed, forwarded, or influenced in some way by the firewall or device. Host‐based firewalls are devices that run directly on a network host or device. A host‐based firewall is deployed for the purpose of protecting the device on which it's installed from an attack. A host‐based firewall usually has predefined rules to protect the host against specific attack patterns. A user can find a persistent agent normally on the end system. Persistent agents often perform compliance along with authentication before allowing systems to have network access. Persistent agents can run continuously.","","9781119477716","10.1002/9781119575948.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821774.pdf&bkn=9820830&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Firewalls (computing);Software;Ports (computers);Hardware;Monitoring;IP networks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Authentication, authorization, and auditing are often used together in cybersecurity when it comes to how someone gains access to a system. By implementing least privilege, cybersecurity professionals can even improve operational performance, reduce the chance of unauthorized behavior, reduce the attack surface, and reduce the chances of malicious software propagating since it might need elevated processes to run. Working in the modern‐day environments requires people to log into multiple programs to get their jobs done. It can be a headache for the average user to remember all those usernames and passwords. To alleviate that issue, they use single sign‐on (SSO) applications. JumpCloud is a cutting‐edge blend of SSO and management of permissions in a network.

Cloud identities have super admins, and those super admins assign the role of Organization Administrator Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to users who manage the organization. In addition, GCP will automatically grant Project Creator and Billing Account Creator IAM roles to all users in the domain. This allows any user to create projects and enable billing for the cost of resources used. Folders are the building blocks of multilayer organizational hierarchies. Organizations contain folders. Folders can contain other folders or projects. A single folder may contain both folders and projects. Folder organization is usually built around the kinds of services provided by resources in the contained projects and the policies governing folders and projects.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821762.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Organizations;Cloud computing;Finance;Software;Law;Companies;Virtual machining","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The results of any operation of clustering or classification of objects strongly depend on the proximity measure chosen. The concept of topological equivalence uses the basic notion of a local neighbourhood. In a discrimination context, the chapter defines the topological equivalence between the chosen proximity measure and the perfect discrimination measure adapted to the data considered, through the adjacency matrix induced by each measure, and proposes a new topological method of discrimination using this selected proximity measure. It defines a criterion for topological equivalence of discrimination to judge the quality of discrimination. The results of the proposed TDA, associated with the “best” discriminating proximity measure, are compared with those of classical metric models of discrimination, linear discriminant analysis and multinomial logistic regression.","","9781119579649","10.1002/9781119579465.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822865.pdf&bkn=9820831&pdfType=chapter","","IEEE Sections;Data analysis;Image color analysis;Databases;Tree graphs;Measurement;Logistics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Privacy, which refers to a person (or a business), y is the freedom from intrusion by others into one's own life, place of residence or work, or relationships with others. Privacy means that you have the freedom to choose who can come into these aspects of your life and what they can know about you. Businesses create and use company confidential or proprietary information almost every day. Both terms reflect the legitimate business need to keep some data and ideas private to the business. The European Union has enacted a series of policies and laws designed to protect individual privacy as businesses and governments exchange data about people, transactions, and themselves.

Communication is the lifeblood of most modern organizations, and a failure of these systems can be disastrous. However, these systems must also be controlled. Web conferencing is a low‐cost method that allows people in different locations to communicate over the Internet. While useful, web conferencing can potentially be sniffed and intercepted by an attacker. Attackers inject themselves into the stream between the web conferencing clients. Remote assistance programs can be used to provide temporary control of a remote computer over a network or the Internet to resolve issues or for troubleshooting purposes. These tools are useful because they allow problems to be addressed remotely and can cut down on the site visits that a technician performs. Hardware‐based VoIP phones look like typical phones but are connected to the data network instead of PSTN.

Assigned groups are where you directly dictate that specific users or computers are put inside. Dynamic groups are where you set criteria, such that when the condition applies, then the user or computer automatically gets evaluated to be contained within the group. Assigned groups, again, simply means you're directing which users or computers are inside. These are akin to on‐prem AD Security Groups, but they're used mostly for targeting where Intune profiles will used. To create an Assigned group, simply pull down the group type as Security, provide a group name and optional description, and then specify the membership type as Assigned.

It is supported by a wide range of processes and tools within a typical IT organization. Access control is all about subjects and objects. Subjects can be anything that is requesting access to or attempting to access anything in our system, whether data or metadata, people, devices, or another process, for whatever purpose.

Cryptography brings many capabilities to the information systems designer, builder, user, and owner. The concept of privacy being a separate and distinct information security need from confidentiality is relatively new; part of the challenge has been gaining acceptance of the fact that modern digitally‐enabled identity theft can be far more damaging to the individual than more traditional forms of impersonation (such as forging someone's signature onto a check drawn on their bank account) has been. Cryptographic algorithms are the formal definition of the processes we use to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext and then decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext. In many cases, these algorithms require a set of control parameters, such as seeds, salts, keys, block size, and cycle or chain (iteration) values. Cryptographic keys provide the “secret sauce” that makes a cryptographic algorithm work. Typically, other algorithms (that are part of the overall cryptographic system) are used to generate new key values.","","9781119542957","10.1002/9781119547921.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822806.pdf&bkn=9820816&pdfType=chapter","","Cryptography;Codes;Symbols;Syntactics;Ciphers;Semantics;Receivers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The basic approach for securing ICS is the defense‐in‐depth approach. It uses methods such as the implementation of zones and conduits recommended by IEC 62443 to secure communications between trusted spaces. A firewall is a device that allows the partitioning policy to be applied between two zones. It makes it possible to filter the data flows, to monitor them and to log them. There are two types of firewalls: network firewalls and firewalls installed on hosts, for example, related to the operating system. Remote access is an important issue for firewall rule management. It is very common for remote access to be required for maintenance by suppliers or integrators, or even for remote operation.","","9781119644514","10.1002/9781119644538.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823111.pdf&bkn=9820857&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Workstations;Protocols;Integrated circuits;Business;Switches;Programmable logic devices","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Cyberspace is different. In cyberspace, technology is broadly spreading its capability, and everyone is using the same weaponry: hackers, criminals, politically motivated hacktivists, national spies, militaries, even the potential cyberterrorist. They are all exploiting the same vulnerabilities, using the same sort of hacking tools, engaging in the same attack tactics, and leaving the same traces behind. They all eavesdrop or steal data. They all engage in denial‐of‐service attacks. They all probe cyber defenses and do their best to cover their tracks. Despite this, knowing the attacker is vitally important. As members of society, we have several different types of organizations that can defend us from an attack. We can call the police or the military. We can call on our national anti‐terrorist agency and our corporate lawyers. Or we can defend ourselves with a variety of commercial products and services.

Google App Engine was originally designed to run applications in language‐specific environments. Since the introduction of App Engine, Google has introduced App Engine Flexible, which can be used to deploy custom runtimes in containers. An App Engine application is a high‐level resource created in a project; that is, each project can have one App Engine application. All resources associated with an App Engine app are created in the region specified when the app is created. Apps have at least one service, which is the code executed in the App Engine environment. Because multiple versions of an application's code base can exist, App Engine supports versioning of apps. A service can have multiple versions, and these are usually slightly different, with newer versions incorporating new features, bug fixes, and other changes relative to earlier versions. When a version executes, it creates an instance of the app.","","9781119564188","10.1002/9781119564409.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821972.pdf&bkn=9820826&pdfType=chapter","","Engines;Internet;Standards;Codes;Uniform resource locators;Python;Microservice architectures","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The idea of defining an security levels comes from the functional safety approach that defines a safety integrity level. The implementation of IEC 62443 begins with a risk analysis. The approach is detailed in document 62443‐3‐2. The approach of the standard 62443 is to define SL‐T according to the level of risk. IEC 62443‐3‐2 also proposes an approach based on calculation of the cyber risk reduction factor. Document 62443‐2‐1 defines requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and continuous improvement of a security program for an IACS.

The key to risk and risk management is simple: it's about making decisions in reliable ways. Reliable decision making is as much about long‐range planning as it is about incident response.

One such framework, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, provides what it calls “a systems life cycle approach for security and policy.” Everything people and human organizations do is a series of steps, and each step is a series of sub steps; our lives and our businesses run on layers upon layers of tasks and subtasks. Risk management is the responsibility of the organization's leaders and stakeholders; they have the primary burdens of due care (to ensure that they're doing business correctly and effectively) and of due diligence (to continuously monitor and assess how well their business is working and whether it could work better).","","9781119542957","10.1002/9781119547921.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823039.pdf&bkn=9820816&pdfType=chapter","","Risk management;Security;Reliability;Interviews;Government;Software;Information systems","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The chapter considers five work environments: craft activities, repetitive activity, the factory, the automated factory, and Industry 4.0. The real work of CAOs involves having long‐term perspective, a historical context, and a view to the future. This means identifying long‐term trends based on evidence from disparate sources and weaving them into a compelling narrative. This also means helping position their companies to be ready. For CAOs employed by companies that make high‐tech products, there is a special consideration. For years, companies have outsourced manufacturing, concentrating on design. This may be dangerous as Industry 4.0 advances, because continued outsourcing may threaten the company's advantages in design.","","9781119570714","10.1002/9781119570790.ch17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821666.pdf&bkn=9820828&pdfType=chapter","","Fourth Industrial Revolution;Production facilities;Production;Computers;Data science;Cotton;Companies","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Only the best products and messages are able to claw their way through the muck of societal noise to capture our attention, but those practices that prove effective pay off. Their brands and products are noticed. And the successful marketing and advertising tactics that survive are replicated and become part of the genetic make‐up of new campaigns and variant strategies. There are a few concepts that are important when working to embed security leaders' message: audience segmentation, personas, and communication channels. Audience segmentation and personas are all about understanding how to contextualize the relevant aspects of their message in ways that will best resonate with different groups/populations that they want to reach.","","9781119566373","10.1002/9781119566380.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822917.pdf&bkn=9820827&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Task analysis;Business;Training;Solids;Shape;Psychology","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Everything that surrounds us is directly or indirectly associated with the environment. The physical component of environment consists of three fundamental sources, namely, air, water, and soil. All these components influence the living organisms, flora, fauna, and microorganisms, naturally. Air, water, and soil are the basic requirement for any organisms to survive in this ecosystem; these elements can be contaminated through natural or anthropogenic activities. These three components are interdependent because pollution in one element will generally affect another element depending on the pollutant. The rapid growth in urbanization and industrialization leads to several pollutants from numerous sources, which affects the quality of environment in huge areas. The existence of such pollutants in the environment will directly affect the human health, living organisms, and ecosystem. Though regulatory bodies are trying to control those pollutants at the source of entry, still there is a need for an effective environmental management program to overcome the hurdles. Consequently, a promising method or technique is essential to detect the harmful effluents in the environment. Many statistical methods and optimization technique were used to monitor the concentrations of pollutants in the environment in order to control the level of pollution and to minimize the health issues. Alternatively, modern nanotechnology‐based biosensors have extensive applications in the field of environmental monitoring, medicine, healthcare systems, food processing and control, agriculture, defense and security, and the bioprocessing areas. Environmental pollution has severe effects on human health. Healthcare systems play a vital role in monitoring the health conditions with the help of pervasive computing, which includes information communication technology, wireless sensor network, and handheld devices. Sensors are of great significance due to the several advantages they offer over the conventional techniques in the field of analysis. A variety of sensors were developed and applied to determine the presence of the pollutants in the environment and to monitor the health status. This chapter details upon the pollutants existing in the air and the health impacts based on those pollutants, examining the significance of the biosensors in environmental monitoring and the different types of sensors used in healthcare systems. A pervasive computing architecture for healthcare system based on environmental monitoring and analysis is presented and discussed.","","9781119438991","10.1002/9781119439004.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821033.pdf&bkn=9820809&pdfType=chapter","","Biosensors;Pollution;Pervasive computing;Medical services;Sensors;Intelligent sensors;Hardware","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

That is, in a crowd network, the qualities of accomplishing tasks are highly dependent on the effective information sharing among intelligent subjects within the networks. Hence, proposing an adaptive information-sharing approach can help improve the performance of crowd networks on accomplishing tasks that are assigned to them. Design/methodology/approach – This paper first introduces the factors that affect effectiveness of information-sharing pattern: the network topology, the resources owned by intelligent subjects and the degree of information demand. By analyzing the correlation between these factors and the performance of crowd networks, an Adaptive Information Sharing Approach for Crowd Networks (AISCN approach) is proposed. By referring to information needed for accomplishing the historical tasks that are assigned to a crowd network, the AISCN approach can explore the optimized information-sharing pattern based on the predefined composite objective function. The authors implement their approach on two crowd networks including bee colony and supply chain, to prove the effectiveness of the approach. Findings – The shared information among intelligent subjects affects the efficiency of task completion in the crowd network. The factors that can be used to describe the effectiveness of information-sharing patterns include the network topology, the resources owned by intelligent subjects and the degree of information demand. The AISCN approach used heuristic algorithm to solve a composite objective function which takes all these factors into consideration, so that the optimized information-sharing pattern can be obtained. Originality/value – This paper introduces a set of factors that can be used to describe the correlation between information-sharing pattern and performance of crowd network. By quantifying such correlation based on these factors, this paper proposes an adaptive information-sharing approach which can explore the optimized information-sharing pattern for a variety of crowd networks. As the approach is a data-driven approach that explores the information-sharing pattern based on the network's performance on historical tasks and network's characteristics, it is adaptive to the dynamic change (change of incoming tasks, change of network characteristics) of the target crowd network. To ensure the commonality of the information-sharing approach, the proposed approach is not designed for a specific optimization algorithm. In this way, during the • implementation of the proposed approach, heuristic algorithms can be chosen according to the complexity of the target crowd network.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-09-2019-0020","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1400100); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:61671049,61301002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826656","Supply chain;Information sharing;Crowd network","Adaptive systems;Correlation;Heuristic algorithms;Supply chains;Information sharing;Complex networks;Linear programming","artificial bee colony algorithm;information networks","bee colony;supply chain;shared information;intelligent subjects;network topology;information demand;AISCN approach;optimized information-sharing pattern;crowd network;adaptive information sharing","","2","","28","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

By quantifying and combining the two factors, a Multi-Factor Business Entropy Quantitative (MFBEQ) model is proposed to calculate the business entropy of a crowd network. Finally, the differential evolution model and k-means clustering are applied to crowd intelligence network, and the species distribution of intelligent subjects is found, so as to achieve quantitative analysis of business entropy. Findings – By establishing the MFBEQ model, this paper found that when the profession distribution of a crowd network is deviate less to the expected distribution, the intelligence level of a crowd network will be higher. Moreover, when subjects within the crowd network interact with each other more actively, the intelligence level of a crowd network becomes higher. Originality/value – This paper aims to build the MFBEQ model according to factors that are related to business entropy and then uses the model to evaluate the intelligence level of a number of crowd networks.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-05-2019-0014","National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:61671049,61301002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826651","Differential evolution;Business entropy;Crowd intelligence;Network profession distribution;Subject interaction patterns","Analytical models;Statistical analysis;Entropy;Task analysis;Information entropy;Business","entropy;evolutionary computation;pattern clustering;social sciences computing","profession distribution;crowd intelligence network;crowd network interact;multifactor business entropy quantitative model;intelligence level analysis;information entropy;profession distribution deviation;subject interaction pattern;differential evolution mode;k-means clustering;MFBEQ model","","1","","29","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Aggregation of the collected data from the crowd is one of the important steps to infer the correct answer, but the existing study seems to be limited to the single-step task. This study aims to look at multiple-step classification tasks and understand aggregation in such cases; hence, it is useful for assessing the classification quality. Design/methodology/approach – The authors present a model to capture the information of the workflow, questions and answers for both single- and multiple-question classification tasks. They propose an adapted approach on top of the classic approach so that the model can handle tasks with several multiple-choice questions in general instead of a specific domain or any specific hierarchical classifications. They evaluate their approach with three representative tasks from existing citizen science projects in which they have the gold standard created by experts. Findings – The results show that the approach can provide significant improvements to the overall classification accuracy. The authors' analysis also demonstrates that all algorithms can achieve higher accuracy for the volunteer- versus paid-generated data sets for the same task. Furthermore, the authors observed interesting patterns in the relationship between the performance of different algorithms and workflow-specific factors including the number of steps and the number of available options in each step. Originality/value – Due to the nature of crowdsourcing, aggregating the collected data is an important process to understand the quality of crowdsourcing results. Different inference algorithms have been studied for simple microtasks consisting of single questions with two or more answers. However, as classification tasks typically contain many questions, the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of tasks including both single- and multiple-question classification tasks.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-06-2019-0017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826653","Aggregation;Classification;Task-oriented crowdsourcing;Quality assessment;Human computation","Crowdsourcing;Atomic measurements;Adaptation models;Sufficient conditions;Correlation;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;natural sciences computing;pattern classification","quality assessment;crowdsourced classification tasks;purpose - Ensuring quality;microtask crowdsourcing tasks;aggregation;existing study;single-step task;multiple-step classification tasks;classification quality;multiple-question classification tasks;adapted approach;classic approach;multiple-choice questions;specific hierarchical classifications;representative tasks;classification accuracy;crowdsourcing results;single questions","","2","","64","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

While dissemination of information provides convenience for life, it also brings many problems such as security risks and public opinion orientation. Various negative, malicious and false information spread across regions, which seriously affect social harmony and national security. Therefore, this paper aims to minimize negative information such as online rumors that has attracted extensive attention. The most existing algorithms for blocking rumors have prevented the spread of rumors to some extent, but these algorithms are designed based on entire social networks, mainly focusing on the microstructure of the network, i.e. the pairwise relationship or similarity between nodes. The blocking effect of these algorithms may be unsatisfactory in some networks because of the sparse data in the microstructure. Design/methodology/approach – An algorithm for minimizing the influence of dynamic rumor based on community structure is proposed in this paper. The algorithm first divides the network into communities, and integrates the influence of each node within communities and rumor influence probability to measure the influence of each node in the entire network, and then selects key nodes and bridge nodes in communities as blocked nodes. After that, a dynamic blocking strategy is adopted to improve the blocking effect of rumors. Findings – Community structure is one of the most prominent features of networks. It reveals the organizational structure and functional components of a network from a mesoscopic level. The utilization of community structure can provide effective and rich information to solve the problem of data sparsity in the microstructure, thus effectively improve the blocking effect. Extensive experiments on two real-world data sets have validated that the proposed algorithm has superior performance than the baseline algorithms. Originality/value – As an important research direction of social network analysis, rumor minimization has a profound effect on the harmony and stability of society and the development of social media. However, because the rumor spread has the characteristics of multiple propagation paths, fast propagation speed, wide propagation area and time-varying, it is a huge challenge to improve the effectiveness of the rumor blocking algorithm.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-09-2019-0025","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61762090,61262069,61472346,61662086); Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province(grant numbers:2016FA026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826657","Social network;Community structure;Influence propagation;Minimization of influence;Rumor blocking","Bridges;Social networking (online);Heuristic algorithms;Focusing;Minimization;Stability analysis;Microstructure","information dissemination;Internet;social networking (online);text analysis","organizational structure;blocking effect;social network analysis;rumor minimization;social media;rumor spread;rumor blocking algorithm;dynamic rumor;Internet technology;open online social networks;information spread;security risks;public opinion orientation;negative information;malicious information;false information;online rumors;dynamic blocking strategy;community structure;information dissemination","","4","","22","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The error will cause the drift point of the positioning point, which makes the vehicle trajectory shift to the real road. This paper aims to solve this problem. Design/methodology/approach – The key technology to solve the problem is map matching (MM). The low sampling frequency of the vehicle is far from the distance between adjacent points, which weakens the correlation between the points, making MM more difficult. In this paper, an MM algorithm based on priority rules is designed for vehicle trajectory characteristics at low sampling frequencies. Findings – The experimental results show that the MM based on priority rule algorithm can effectively match the trajectory data of low sampling frequency with the actual road, and the matching accuracy is better than other similar algorithms, the processing speed reaches 73 per second. Research limitations/implications – In the algorithm verification of this paper, although the algorithm design and experimental verification are considered considering the diversity of GPS data sampling frequency, the experimental data used are still a single source.

To capture the high dynamics in task arrival and wireless network, a stochastic optimization problem which minimizes the energy consumption while guaranteeing queue stability is formulated. By exploiting the stochastic optimization theory, we transform the original problem into a deterministic optimization problem. A radio resource and task allocation (RRTA) algorithm is designed to acquire the optimal solutions of this problem. Theoretical analysis shows that RRTA can achieve arbitrary tradeoff between the energy consumption and queue length. Moreover, the close-to-optimal energy consumption can be reached by RRTA while bounding the queueing length. Experiment results reveal that RRTA can effectively decrease the energy consumption and maintain a small queue length.","","978-1-7281-1878-9","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS47286.2019.9759723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9759723","mobile edge computing;wireless power transfer;radio resource allocation;task allocation","Energy consumption;Multi-access edge computing;Conferences;Wireless networks;Wireless power transfer;Delays;Resource management","Internet of Things;mobile computing;quality of service;queueing theory;radiofrequency power transmission;resource allocation;stochastic programming","dynamic radio resource;task allocation;wireless powered mobile edge computing system;Internet of things devices;quality of service;radio frequency;power transfer;IoT devices;sustainable energy supply;offload computation tasks;computing ability;wireless powered MEC system;task arrival;wireless network;stochastic optimization problem;stochastic optimization theory;deterministic optimization problem;RRTA;queue length;close-to-optimal energy consumption;queueing length","","","","11","IEEE","22 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consistent with devices with fin widths larger than 10 nm, higher transient peak and greater charge collection are observed in wider fin devices as a result of larger active volumes. The amplitude of the SET and the collected charge also increase with $V_{DS}$ due to the enhancement of electric field along the channel, and decrease as the overdrive voltage increases due to the reduced excess electron density.

Developing RHBD versions of similar devices risks sacrificing processing performance for system-wide radiation requirements. The heterogenous structure of modern commercial system on a chip (SOC) devices, in design and performance goals for subsystems, suggests a similar approach to specifying Radiation Hardened by Design (RHBD) requirements. New RHBD devices can benefit from heterogenous radiation requirements and testing for subsystems. Such an approach has been taken in the High-Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC) architecture, but this has led to difficulties on three fronts. First, how should the subsystems be divided in order that part of the device can actually meet radiation requirements in the presence of potentially much weaker requirements for other parts of the system? Second, what are appropriate radiation requirements for such a device, including a possible extra-radiation hardened embedded controller? And finally, how should a device with multiple radiation performance subsystem requirements be tested for radiation performance?","1609-0438","978-1-7281-5699-6","10.1109/RADECS47380.2019.9745708","NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745708","SEE;Radiation;SOC;Heterogenous;Space Processing","Performance evaluation;Radiation hardening (electronics);Microprocessors;Digital signal processors;Graphics processing units;Computer architecture;Hardware","embedded systems;microprocessor chips;radiation hardening (electronics);system-on-chip","chip devices;SOC;Radiation Hardened;heterogenous radiation requirements;High-Performance Spaceflight Computer architecture;multiple radiation performance subsystem requirements;Radiation specification;heterogenous microprocessor SOCs;modern commercial microprocessor devices;multiple processor architectures;application hardware;Graphics Processing Units;Digital Signal Processors;RHBD versions;system-wide radiation requirements;heterogenous structure;RHBD devices","","","","15","IEEE","4 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proton radiation-induced degradation of HEMTs was occurred by the displacement damage effect, which is directly related to the nonionizing energy loss (NIEL). The saturation drain current of 0.5 MeV-irradiated HEMT has more severely degraded than that of 60 MeV-irradiated HEMT because the lower proton energy has the larger NIEL. The threshold voltage of HEMTs with proton irradiation is usually positively shifted due to the reduction of 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density by defects created during irradiation, however, the 60 MeV-irradiated HEMT showed the negative threshold voltage shift, which is discrepant from reported results.","1609-0438","978-1-7281-5699-6","10.1109/RADECS47380.2019.9745669","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1D1A1B07051027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745669","","Protons;Radiation effects;Energy loss;Temperature;Europe;HEMTs;Threshold voltage","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;high electron mobility transistors;III-V semiconductors;ion implantation;proton effects;radiation effects;two-dimensional electron gas;wide band gap semiconductors","proton irradiation energy;ion-implanted isolation;irradiation energies;proton radiation-induced degradation;nonionizing energy loss;irradiated HEMT;high electron mobility transistors;saturation drain current;2-dimensional electron gas density;negative threshold voltage shift;electron volt energy 0.5 MeV;electron volt energy 5.0 MeV;electron volt energy 60.0 MeV;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;AlGaN-GaN","","","","16","IEEE","4 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Event rate, sampled at one orbital period, is heavily superim-posed by normal variance due to intrinsic Poisson distribution of SEE. A moving average filter extracts features attributed to the solar cycle, the South Atlantic Anomaly (SSA) seasonal behaviour and device degradation. Further data is needed to study the response to geomagnetic storms, since available ones are relative to a prolonged ‘solar lull’ period.

Electrical parameters are measured using KEITHLEY 4200-SCS semiconductor characterization system during irradiation. The radiation induced defects are characterized by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). The experimental results show that the degradation of current gain for the F2N2219 BJTs for the sum of the independent Co-60 gamma radiation and heavy ion irradiation is larger than that for the sequential irradiations, indicating the existence of significant synergistic effect. For lower fluence of 40 MeV Si ions, when the dose of Co-60 gamma ray is lower, the excess base current of the irradiated transistors by the sequential irradiation is less than one of the irradiated transistors by the independent 40 MeV Si ions. When fluence of 40 MeV Si ions is more than 6×l08/cm2, all the excess base current of the irradiated transistors by the sequential irradiation is less than one of the irradiated transistors by the independent 40 MeV Si ions. These results show that ionization damage on the transistors caused by the subsequent Co-60 gamma ray has an annealing effect on displacement damage caused by the 40 MeV Si ions. DLTS analyses show that the displacement defects especially in V2(-/0) centers caused by the 40 MeV Si ions are annealed due to the oxide charges induced by Co-60 gamma ray irradiations. Moreover, the fluence of the independent 40 MeV Si ions is the larger, the annealing effect of the displacement defects is the more obvious.","1609-0438","978-1-7281-5699-6","10.1109/RADECS47380.2019.9745696","Science Challenge Project(grant numbers:TZ2018004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11575049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745696","Bipolar junction transistors;ionization damage;displacement damage;synergistic effect;annealing effect","Degradation;Radiation effects;Semiconductor device measurement;Annealing;Ionization;Gamma-rays;Europe","annealing;bipolar transistors;deep level transient spectroscopy;electron beam effects;elemental semiconductors;gamma-ray effects;ion beam effects;semiconductor materials;silicon","annealing effect;ionization damage;2N2219 NPN bipolar junction transistors;heavy ion irradiation;irradiated transistors;displacement defects;Co-60 gamma ray irradiations;deep level transient spectroscopy;KEITHLEY 4200-SCS semiconductor characterization;electrical parameters;Si","","","","11","IEEE","4 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The WFEE is a mixed electronic system, including analog devices, such as low noise amplifier and current sources for amplifying and biasing cryogenic stages, and also integrating digital devices: serial decoders RS485/ I2C for configuring the current sources. Because of extreme radiation space environment, different RHBD techniques have been used to improve the radiation tolerance of the WFEE electronics. The tolerance against radiation effects TID and SEL have been assessed. The evolution of the main parameters of the amplifier (gain and noise) and of the current sources (output current and noise) with respect to different dose levels has also been measured.

Test results of ISSI 65 nm SRAMs on a flash X-ray machine and a pulsed reactor are presented. We adopted binomial distributions to fit the obtained upset-multiplicity data. The pulsed-neutron results exhibit precise and consistent accordance with the binomial distributions. In contrast, the flash X-ray data sharply diverge from the binomial distributions as the dose rate exceeds the upset threshold. However, the discrepancy reduces significantly after the bit-upset proportion saturates at higher dose rates. Interestingly, the binomial distributions fit well with the flash X-ray data at all dose rates if combinations of 2 or 3 different binomial distributions are applied. To explain the observed phenomena, the underlying mechanisms of dose rate upsets and neutron-induced single event upsets are further discussed. Above all, the presented approach of analyzing upset-multiplicity occurrences of upset bursts provides a novel and straightforward means to differentiate localized and global effects, and is especially useful for dose-rate-upset analysis when the correspondence between physical and logical addresses is unavailable.","1609-0438","978-1-7281-5699-6","10.1109/RADECS47380.2019.9745727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745727","flash X-rays;pulsed neutrons;dose rate upsets (DRUs);single event upsets (SEUs);upset multiplicity;binomial distribution;SRAM","Single event upsets;Europe;X-rays;Neutrons;Inductors","binomial distribution;radiation hardening (electronics);SRAM chips","3 different binomial distributions;dose rate upsets;neutron-induced single event upsets;upset-multiplicity occurrences;upset bursts;dose-rate-upset analysis;flash X-rays;pulsed neutrons;ISSI 65 nm SRAMs;flash X-ray machine;pulsed reactor;upset-multiplicity data;pulsed-neutron results;flash X-ray data;upset threshold;bit-upset proportion saturates;higher dose rates;2 distributions;size 65.0 nm","","","","8","IEEE","4 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed LVDS-TX has been fabricated by using bulk I/O and SOI core transistors in a 65 nm FDSOI process.

Deep learning models have been investigated to solve this problem. Setting up a new neural network model is a crucial and time-consuming process. Alternatively, pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models offer rapid modeling. The selection of the hyperparameters of CNNs is a challenging issue that heavily depends on user experience. The parameters of CNNs should be carefully selected to get effective results. For this purpose, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is used for tuning the parameters to get optimum results. The proposed method includes three main stages: the image preprocessing stage involves automatic cropping of the meaningful area within the images in the data set, the transfer learning stage includes experiments with six different pre-trained CNN models and the hyperparameter tuning stage using the ABC algorithm. Performance comparison of the pre-trained CNN models involving the use and nonuse of the ABC algorithm for the Stanford 40 data set is presented. The experiments show that the pre-trained CNN models with ABC are more successful than pre-trained CNN models without ABC. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the improved NASNet-Large CNN model with the ABC algorithm gives the best accuracy of 87.78% for the overall success rate-based performance metric.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684837","convolutional neural networks;action recognition;artificial bee colony algorithm;transfer learning;pre-trained models","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thermal sensors have proficiency of sensing the object heedless of the lighting conditions. Due to this added leverage of thermal sensors, we propose a novel scheme for spotting the object, which is targeted by a specific thermal camera. The accomplishment of this task paves the opportunity for guiding the visually impaired (VI) people within the indoor environment adequately. Augmenting the obstacles in the user's path is requisite for the VI people's navigation. The image of the object is captured using the thermal camera and pre-processed for enhancing the quality of that image by suppressing the background, tuning the colour channels, etc. Noise in the thermal image is eradicated to a certain extent using Gaussian smoothing process followed by Markov random field for constructing the Gaussian mixture model. Further, the pattern is deduced and classified based on the least-squares support-vector machine. The experiment is tested for disparate timing and distance, and the optimum solution is obtained.

Different traditional approaches were suggested based on hypothesis testing and statistical modeling. Therefore, the primary purpose of the research is to come up with a model that can estimate the probability of corporate bankruptcy by evaluating its occurrence of failure using different machine learning models. As the dataset was not well prepared and contains missing values, various data mining and data pre-processing techniques were utilized for data preparation. Within this research, the task of resolving the issues induced by the imbalance between the two classes is approached by applying different data balancing techniques. We address the problem of imbalanced data with the random undersampling and Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE). We used five machine learning models (support vector machine, J48 decision tree, Logistic model tree, random forest and decision forest) to predict corporate bankruptcy earlier to the occurrence. We use data from 2009 to 2013 on Poland manufacturing corporates and selected the 64 financial indicators to be broken down. The main finding of the study is a significant improvement in predictive accuracy using machine learning techniques. We also include other economic indicators ratios, along with Altman's Z-score variables related to profitability, liquidity, leverage and solvency (short/long term) to propose an efficient model. Machine learning models give better results while balancing the data through SMOTE as compared to random undersampling. The machine learning technique related to decision forest led to 99% accuracy, whereas support vector machine (SVM), J48 decision tree, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Random Forest (RF) led to 92%, 92.3%, 93.8% and 98.7% accuracy, respectively, with all predictive financial indicators. We find that the decision forest outperforms the other techniques and previous techniques discussed in the literature. The proposed method is also deployed on the web to assist regulators, investors, creditors and scholars to predict corporate bankruptcy.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684838","corporate bankruptcy prediction;imbalanced dataset;random undersampling;SMOTE;data mining;machine learning;deployment","","","","","5","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Firstly, the motion history images (MHIs) and static history images (SHIs) are created from the front (XOY), side (YOZ) and top (XOZ) projected scenes of each depth sequence in a 3D Euclidean space through engaging the 3D Motion Trail Model (3DMTM). Then, the Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) algorithm is operated on the MHIs and SHIs to learn motion and static hierarchical features to represent the action sequence. The motion and static hierarchical feature vectors are then fed into a classifier ensemble to classify action classes, where the ensemble comprises of two classifiers. Thus, each ensemble includes a pair of Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) or ${\mathrm{l}}_{\mathrm{2}}$-regularized Collaborative Representation Classifier (${\mathrm{l}}_{\mathrm{2}}$-CRC) or Multi-class Support Vector Machine. To extensively assess the framework, we perform experiments on a couple of standard available datasets such as MSR-Action3D, UTD-MHAD and DHA. Experimental consequences demonstrate that the proposed approach gains a state-of-the-art recognition performance in comparison with other available approaches. Several statistical measurements on recognition results also indicate that the method achieves superiority when the hierarchical features are adopted with the KELM ensemble. In addition, to ensure real-time processing capability of the algorithm, the running time of major components is investigated. Based on machine dependency of the running time, the computational complexity of the system is also shown and compared with other methods. Experimental results and evaluation of the computational time and complexity reflect real-time compatibility and feasibility of the proposed system.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684831","human action recognition;motion history image;static history image;local binary patterns;logarithmic opinion pool;kernel extreme learning machine","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Initially, weighted transformation in the input data is carried out that correctly distinguishes the interclass labels, and it is determined to be the specified features. Because of the presence of numerous amounts of features, the ‘prediction’ becomes a serious issue, and therefore the optimal selection of features is important. Here, for optimal feature selection process, a new Levi Flight Cub Update-based lion algorithm (LFCU-LA) is introduced that can be a modification in lion algorithm. Once the optimal features are selected, they are given to the classification process that exploits a hybrid classifier: deep belief network (DBN) and neural network (NN). Additionally, the most important contributions in the hidden neurons of DBN and NN were optimally selected that paves way for exact detection.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684840","autism spectrum disorder;feature selection;weighted logarithmic transformation;optimization;classification","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The key contribution is the innovative use of QSVD, which can extract stable and discriminative image features from CIE L*a*b* color space. In addition, image features of a block are viewed as a point in the Cartesian coordinates and compressed by calculating the Euclidean distance between its point and a reference point. As the Euclidean distance requires smaller storage than the original block features, this technique helps to make a discriminative and compact hash. Experiments with three open image databases are conducted to validate efficiency of our image hashing. The results demonstrate that our image hashing can resist many digital operations and reaches a good discrimination. Receiver operating characteristic curve comparisons illustrate that our image hashing outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms in classification performance.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684832","image hashing;quaternion matrix;quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD);color space;image feature","","","","","3","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Specifically, VPad emits inaudible acoustic signals from two speakers in a laptop and then analyzes energy features and Doppler shifts of acoustic signals received by the microphone to track the trajectory of hand movements. Furthermore, we propose a state machine-based trajectory optimization method to correct the unexpected trajectory and employ a stroke direction sequence model based on probability estimation to recognize characters users write in the air.

Unfortunately, it is accompanied by speckle which can degrade texture information by obscuring fine details like boundaries and edges. This work presents a method for despeckling ultrasound images by treating them with multiscale modified speckle reduction anisotropic diffusion model and Non-Subsampled shearlet transform (NSST). The method involves division of images using a non-subsampled Laplacian pyramid. This results in low and high frequency image components. Modified anisotropic diffusion is used on the low frequency part. The high frequency component, as subjected to shearlet function, generates noisy coefficients in various directions. These coefficients are further subjected to NSST thresholding. The denoised low and high frequency image components are then recombined to obtain the enhanced image. This multidimensional and multidirectional method improves the qualitative characteristics of ultrasound images by not just removing speckle noise but also by preserving edges, thus resulting in effective image enhancement. Performance of the method is analysed on synthetic and real medical ultrasound images. Results reveal that the proposed method exceeds the state-of-the-art methods in the context of edge preservation and structural similarities, and thus, it is an effective aid to radiologists in their clinical diagnosis by providing an enhanced denoised image.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684786","Enhancement;Speckle reduction;Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform;Modified Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Microarray-based gene expression helps with the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer. The nature of diseases frequently changes, which in turn generates a considerable volume of data. The main drawback of microarray data is the curse of dimensionality. It hinders useful information and leads to computational instability. The main objective of feature selection is to extract and remove insignificant and irrelevant features to determine the informative genes that cause cancer. Random forest is a well-suited classification algorithm for microarray data. To enhance the importance of the variables, we proposed out-of-bag (OOB) cases in every tree of the forest to count the number of votes for the exact class. The incorporation of random permutation in the variables of these OOB cases enables us to select the crucial features from high-dimensional microarray data. In this study, we analyze the effects of various random forest parameters on the selection procedure. ‘Variable drop fraction’ regulates the forest construction. The higher variable drop fraction value efficiently decreases the dimensionality of the microarray data. Forest built with 800 trees chooses fewer important features under any variable drop fraction value that reduces microarray data dimensionality.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684790","microarray;curse of dimensionality;random forest;feature selection;high-dimensional dataset","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

On the one hand, it is difficult to find the same emotion state in different persons since they may express the same emotion state in various ways. On the other hand, it is also hard to seek the difference between expressions of the same person because some emotion states are too subtle to discriminate. The focus of this work is to solve these two problems by proposing a new approach of emotion recognition. This novel approach allows our emotion recognition system to classify 18 emotions (primary emotions and their intensities). First, we proposed textual definitions of the intensity emotions. Then, we created our emotion recognition system, which is composed of three stages: pre-treatment, feature extraction and classification. We used the deep learning for the feature extraction and the fuzzy logic for the classification. The experimental test demonstrates the efficiency of our system for primary emotions and their intensities' classification compared to other methods.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684791","primary emotions;intensities;feature extraction;classification;deep learning;fuzzy logic","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Initially, the face in the videos is subjected to face detection using the Viola Jones algorithm. Then, the object tracking is performed using the knocker and holoentropy-based Bhattacharya distance, which is a modification of the Bhattacharya distance using the knocker and holoentropy. After that, the features, such as object-level features and speed-level features of the objects, are extracted and the features are employed to the proposed TimeRideNN classifier, which declares the anomalous objects in the video. The experimentation of the proposed anomaly detection method is done using the UCSD dataset (Ped1), subway dataset and QMUL junction dataset, and the analysis is performed based on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

The coexistence of magnetic and electric order allows both magnetic and electric fields to interact with magnetic and electric order. These properties could be utilized for information storage, processing, and transmission. A perovskite structure is any compound with the same structure as the perovskite mineral and its complex oxides have the ABO3 structure. Perovskite materials with high dielectric performance are most valuable for multilayered capacitors, non-volatile memory, multiferroics, and energy storage due to their attractive ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties. Ferroelectricity is a characteristic of certain materials having a spontaneous electric polarization which can be reversed by applying an external electric field. In piezoelectric materials, the coupling between mechanical and electrical energy results in an electric polarization when stress is applied. In pyroelectric materials, the polar axis allows a net polarization when the temperature is changed. In ferroelectrics, their polarization can be reversed through the application of an electric field. The synthesis of complex oxide nanocrystals through the process of green and scalable “self collection” growth method. The synthesis approach is solution processed, based on the sol-gel transformation of metal alkoxides in alcohol solvents with controlled amounts of water providing pure colloidal nanocrystals. Under a static condition, the nanoscale hydrolysis of the metal alkoxides allows for self-accumulation to form crystallized perovskite nanocrystals with a layer of hydroxyl making it a highly crystalline solid gel monolith separate from the liquid phase. The solid is then separated from the liquid and purified to make highly crystalline solid of very high yield and no impurity.

This project explores the use of a visionless sensor system and landmark-based localization to autonomously land a quadcopter accurately in the center of a predefined landing site. This approach is less computationally intensive than computer vision-based systems and can work regardless of lighting conditions. The nano-quadcopter used in this project has six infrared laser distance sensors that are used to localize by detecting the landing pad markers. This method resulted in successful landings in the landing site 83% of the time, with only few failures that can be attributed to the instability of the nano-quadcopter.

Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) can frequently be these substitutes due to their versatility and sublime performance. Carbon fiber (CF) reinforced PMCs are lightweight, strong, and tough. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is an aerospace-grade polymer that is now commonly reinforced with CF. The purpose of this project was to prepare a CF-PMC using recycled carbon fiber (RCF) recovered from CF-PMC components after their useful life time and to compare the properties to a virgin CF-PMC. The mechanical properties, thermal properties, morphology, and electrical conductivity of CF-PEEK and RCF-PEEK were characterized. Mechanical property results reveal that RCF-PEEK have a higher flexural modulus but lower impact strength than CF-PEEK. Thermal property results show that RCF and CF-PEEK are similar in their transition temperatures. Morphology images indicate uniform distribution and strong fiber-matrix interaction for both RCF and CF-PEEK. Evaluation of electrical conductivity data reveals that CF-PEEK can be used as an insulating material, and RCF-PEEK can be used as a semiconducting material. Overall, RCFs can be used in certain applications with similar effectiveness to virgin CFs.

The vast majority of dense clinical information is stored in written reports, detailing pertinent patient information. The challenge with utilizing natural language data for standard model development is due to the complex and unstructured nature of the modality. In this research, a model pipeline was developed to utilize an unsupervised approach to train a language model, a bidirectional recurrent neural network, to generate document encodings; which then can be used as features passed into a classifier model that requires magnitudes less labeled data than previous approaches to differentiate between fine-grained disease classes accurately. The language model was trained on raw clinical reports from the Partner's Healthcare database <tex>$(\mathrm{n}=218,159)$</tex> and terminated with a loss of 1.62 and a word prediction accuracy of 62%. The classification models were trained on three labeled datasets, occlusion <tex>$(\mathrm{n}=1403)$</tex>, stroke <tex>$(\mathrm{n}=331)$</tex>, and hemorrhage <tex>$(\mathrm{n}=4350)$</tex>, to identify a variety of different occlusions, stroke, and hemorrhages, directly from the clinical report data; resulting in AUCs of 0.98, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively, for the occlusion, stroke, and hemorrhage datasets. The output encodings are able to be used in conjunction with images or waveform data, to create models that can process a multitude of different modalities. The ability to automatically extract relevant features from textual data allows for faster model development and integration of textual modality, overall, allowing clinical reports to become a more viable input for more encompassing and accurate deep learning models.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660430","electronic healthcare;natural language processing;semisupervised learning;medical analysis","Analytical models;Pipelines;Feature extraction;Data models;Encoding;Clinical diagnosis;Hemorrhaging","diseases;medical administrative data processing;natural language processing;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;semi-supervised learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","pertinent patient information;standard model development;complex nature;unstructured nature;model pipeline;unsupervised approach;language model;bidirectional recurrent neural network;document encodings;classifier model;fine-grained disease classes;raw clinical reports;healthcare database;classification models;occlusion;stroke;clinical report data;hemorrhage datasets;waveform data;textual data;faster model development;accurate deep learning models;semisupervised natural language processing approach;fine-grained classification;medical reports;machine learning;clinical analysis;supervised learning approaches;development task;dense clinical information;written reports;natural language data","","1","","7","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we explored the usage of a process called dislocation engineering that modifies the lattice structure of the superconductor to change its intrinsic properties. To achieve this, the ion beam from a scanning helium ion microscope was used to damage the material. Dose response tests were performed to determine helium ion beam parameters to modify the superconductive lattice sufficiently. For the test, a nanowire was damaged for each trial of different doses, and the current-voltage characteristics were determined for the resulting structure. Results showed that using the helium ion beam for dislocation engineering to fabricate nanowire has promise.

Six Sigma, a set of techniques used by businesses to reduce the number of defective parts, and ergonomic analyses are applied in tandem to control the quality of production processes. The application of quality control techniques in the PVC extrusion process, specifically in the production of window and patio door frames, was explored. Profile 5531, a piece of a patio door frame with a significant defect rate, was investigated by analyzing numerous samples produced at the Silver Line window facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey. After process capability reports were run on the analyzed samples, dimensional offsets and variability within the production process were found to be the root cause of the defects. Additionally, the width offset introduced ergonomic strains for the punching machine operators, so a force study was conducted to analyze injury risk. To address the extrusion issue, various quick solutions were proposed and implemented using the Six Sigma methodology, including increasing the PVC hopper feed and adjusting the dry calibration rails. These changes were shown to significantly improve the efficacy of the production process and reduce ergonomic strains for the operators. Potential long-term solutions such as changing the factory environment and automating the punching machine were also devised to improve both the extrusion process and worker safety for companies like Silver Line.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660461","Lockheed Martin; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660461","","Silver;Ergonomics;Punching;Force;Process control;Production;Companies","calibration;ergonomics;extrusion;personnel;quality control;six sigma (quality)","Silver Line extrusion-improving quality;Sigma methods;ergonomic analyses;industrial processes;physical process;defective parts;production process;quality control techniques;PVC extrusion process;patio door frames;patio door frame;significant defect rate;Silver Line window facility;process capability reports;analyzed samples;ergonomic strains;punching machine operators;extrusion issue;Sigma methodology","","","","8","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Developing a Device- Independent Software for Adaptive Tremor Suppression Orthoses","A. Zhang",NA,"2019 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC)","4 Jan 2022","2019","","","1","4","Tremors are a debilitating symptom of common neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Essential Tremor which affects over 10 million people in the U.S. alone. Currently, non-invasive tremor-suppression orthoses under research development are limited by their inability to calculate precise in-phase suppression signals and calibrated torques for controlled tremor suppression. Current solutions to this problem involve complex modeling of the orthosis device and require software remodeling when the hardware is changed. In addition, adaptation to personal conditions with various loads is not covered in the literature. To address these issues, a device-independent, adaptive tremor suppression library for tremor orthoses is developed. The library filters tremor-induced motions from a tremor patient's voluntary movements from sensor signals. It then predicts an inphase actuator response that suppresses tremor-induced motions in real-time. A deep neural network (CNN-LSTM) inferences a sequence of future tremor signals to account for processing and actuator response time delays. The library can calibrate the time delay precisely and convert the model output through a feedback loop into a calibrated torque signal, which an actuator uses to suppress a tremor with solely the necessary counteractive force. The library achieves tremor signal prediction by an average phase error of 2.8ms and an average amplitude suppression efficiency of 87% when predicting 50ms ahead on sequences of real patient data. This library serves as the first modular software for smart tremor suppression, and will later be implemented onto edge devices.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660564","","Neurological diseases;Actuators;Torque;Delay effects;Neural networks;Libraries;Software","biomechanics;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feedback;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;orthotics;recurrent neural nets","neurological diseases;essential tremor;in-phase suppression signals;adaptive tremor suppression library;sensor signals;tremor signal prediction;tremor-induced motions;adaptive tremor suppression orthoses;Parkinson's diseases;deep neural network;CNN-LSTM;feedback loop","","","","20","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we model sum-product network, convolutional neural networks with ReLU activation function, and two-layer feed forward networks as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition. Then, we analyze the construction of neural networks to explain why the networks possess the capability of recognizing symmetry structures. Thirdly, we exploit the classic Kruskal's Uniqueness Theorem to provide a sufficient condition when the local optimals will be global, which mathematically explain the emergence of such a generalization capability.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660429","Neural networks;tensor decomposition;Kruskal Uniqueness Theorem;generalization capability;global optimality","Deep learning;Sufficient conditions;Tensors;Conferences;Neural networks;Mathematical models;Feeds","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;tensors;transfer functions","symmetry structures;model sum-product network;convolutional neural networks;ReLU activation function;two-layer feed forward networks;generalization capability;tensor perspective;experiences great success;neural nets;global optimality;theoretical explanation;tensor approach","","","","13","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key to implement efficient SCI cameras is accurate reconstruction algorithms. However, existing works are not satisfactory due to either low fidelity or extensive running time. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor nuclear-norm minimization scheme that achieves fast and accurate reconstruction for SCI cameras. First, we model the high-speed video as a low tubal-rank tensor and exploit the low tubal-rank property to reconstruct the high-speed video frames from the measurement frame. Second, we propose a novel tensor nuclear-norm minimization scheme using Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier algorithm, called TNN-ADMM. Finally, we present performance evaluations on two synthetic videos and one real SCI camera video. The propsed TNN-ADMM scheme exhibits an average improvement of 3.5 dB in PSNR over the GAP-TV algorithm, and reduces DeSCI's 8 hours' running time to less than 6 minutes.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660548","Snapshot compressive imaging cameras;rank minimization;tensor nuclear-norm;ADMM","Performance evaluation;Image sensors;Tensors;Optical variables measurement;Reconstruction algorithms;Cameras;Minimization","cameras;data compression;image coding;image denoising;image reconstruction;image sensors;iterative methods;matrix algebra;minimisation;tensors","snapshot compressive imaging cameras;high-speed video frames;low-resolution sensors;measurement frame;efficient SCI cameras;accurate reconstruction algorithms;low fidelity;extensive running time;novel tensor nuclear-norm minimization scheme;SCI camera;tubal-rank tensor;tubal-rank property;synthetic videos;propsed TNN-ADMM scheme;noise figure 3.5 dB;time 8.0 hour;time 6.0 min","","","","13","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, patients are appropriately diagnosed only after being transported to nearby medical centers, which currently takes about 7–15 minutes on average. This project aims to expedite this diagnostic process by training neural networks on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data to automate the identification of injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents. Data was aggregated from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts via the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, for patients' electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory rate reports. Natural Language Processing was used to isolate the patients of interest and classify them based on the area of injury, i.e., any of eight combinations of the three vital organs: brain, heart, and lungs. Upon isolation of the waveform data, noise was filtered via normalization, Butterworth and forward-backward filter application, and Fast Fourier transformation. The trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) contained 23 dense layers with the number of neurons decreasing per two layers with ReLU activation and 10% dropout. Multiclass activation was used for the final layer, in order to allow training for detection of multiple areas of trauma. The trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) had 12 convolutions, utilizing batch normalization, six pooling, one flatten, and two dense layers. Both models used AdamOptimizer. The CNN and ANN produced F1 scores of 0.82 and 0.56 respectively, suggesting the models could potentially perform accurate early detection of injury area and expedite hospital treatment of trauma patients.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660462","patient monitoring;medical analysis;neural networks;electronic healthcare","Training;Heart;Analytical models;Hospitals;Lung;Predictive models;Personnel","brain;Butterworth filters;convolutional neural nets;electrocardiography;fast Fourier transforms;injuries;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical information systems;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;natural language processing;patient treatment;pneumodynamics;signal classification","motor vehicle trauma patients;motor vehicle accidents;diagnostic process;intensive care unit data;Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center;MIMIC-III database;natural language processing;trained artificial neural network;trained convolutional neural network;injury area;organ failure detection;forward-backward filter;medical-information-mart-for-intensive-care-III database;machine learning;ICU data;electrocardiogram;respiratory rate;brain;heart;lungs;noise filtering;Butterworth filter;fast Fourier transformation;ReLU activation;multiclass activation;CNN;ANN;hospital treatment","","","","6","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, five strains of E. coli, which were previously genetically engineered to synthesize phenol from tyrosine, were compared for their phenol production capabilities. BL21(DE3) was determined to be the most efficient strain for producing phenol, as it generated the most phenol per cell density unit. The high specific production value of the strain indicated that BL21(DE3) is a robust candidate for producing phenol in a more environmentally conscious manner.

FAME comprises two models: one uses a non-human approach, which uses logistic regression trained on binary labels and uses the probability output as the measure for how male or female a face is, and the other model uses a human approach, based on learning continuous human labels of the perceived level of”femininity/masculinity”. To gather human labels, a crowdsourcing platform was used to obtain 5500 total human labels of 1100 faces using a 7-level masculinity/femininity scale. Linear regression was then trained with 10-fold cross validation with L1 regression on the 68 facial landmarks extracted from the images. By developing and comparing the FAME models, we gain insight on the characteristics that may be associated more with one gender. Logistic regression weights found that a shorter and wider nose may be more male, and linear regression weights found that features such as low eyebrows, thinner lips, and wider jaws may be characteristic of increasing maleness.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660606","gender;facial androgyny;logistic regression;linear regression","Crowdsourcing;Lips;Conferences;Linear regression;Nose;Estimation;Feature extraction","face recognition;feature extraction;gender issues;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;regression analysis","gender detection;binary standpoint;facial images;gender appearance;nonhuman approach;binary labels;probability output;crowdsourcing platform;10-fold cross validation;FAME models;logistic regression weights;linear regression weights;facial androgyny measure and estimation models;facial landmarks;feminine appearance;masculine appearance;learning continuous human labels;7-level masculinity;L1 regression","","","","7","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this countermeasure, malware can avoid being detected by signature-based detection approaches commonly used by much of today's anti-virus software. As a result, developing new methods of detecting malware has become an area of great interest. Due to the recent rise in big-data analytics, machine-learning based approaches have gained a lot of traction. In this paper, we present a malware detection system using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) machine-learning model trained on Intel x86 instruction sequences of disassembled programs.

This was combined with an autonomous car model to simulate the integrated notification system. A series of tests using the facial orientation, eye closure, and drowsiness metrics were conducted to determine the system's functionality and limitations.

We selected features that are closely linked to preterm birth: a major concern due to its high rates in the region. To analyze the data for trends, we applied a k-means clustering machine learning algorithm. However, due to the many missing values and the inability of the algorithm to handle them, the number of participants with complete data values who are able to be used in the analysis significantly decreased. To make use of as many study participants as possible, we tested three imputation methods, including machine learning algorithms, to predict values for the three of our features with the highest number of missing values. Specifically, we used mean imputation, linear regression, and random forest regression.

Many cities have systems in place where citizens can submit ticket requests to help improve communications of their issues. However, the time to complete these tasks satisfactorily can vary drastically depending on a number of factors which can frustrate citizens. To improve the process, a more in-depth understanding of how different attributes affect the completion time of these tickets is needed. For example, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the Department of Public Works and Department of Inspectional Services complete service ticket requests. Like many departments in cities across the world, both of these departments receive a high volume of requests annually and the amount can make managing and analyzing requests difficult. To combat this issue, unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, including autoencoders, angle-based outlier detection, gradient boosting, isolation forests, and neural networks, are applied to identify anomalous tickets. By identifying these outliers the efficiency in which government entities can complete these requests can be greatly increased and thusly improving the relationship between a city and its citizens.","","978-1-7281-5818-1","10.1109/URTC49097.2019.9660475","NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660475","Urban data;Anomaly detection;Machine learning","Conferences;Urban areas;Government;Neural networks;Forestry;Boosting;Task analysis","data handling;government data processing;local government;neural nets;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","unsupervised learning techniques;government entities;anomaly detection;large-scale municipal data;ticket requests;Massachusetts;supervised learning;autoencoders;angle-based outlier detection;gradient boosting;isolation forests;neural networks;anomalous ticket identification;Worcester Department of Public Works;Worcester Department of Inspectional Services","","","","11","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we investigate existing software analyzers and verifiers, which implement fuzzing and bounded model checking (BMC) techniques, to detect memory safety and concurrency errors. We also investigate fragility aspects related to the UAV communication link. All UAV components (e.g., position, velocity, and attitude control) heavily depend on the communication link. Our preliminary results show that fuzzing and BMC techniques can detect various software vulnerabilities, which are of particular interest to ensure security in UAVs.

This paper describes a highly-optimized software implementation of scalar multiplication for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange on resource-limited IoT devices that achieves fast execution times along with reasonably small code size and RAM consumption. Our software uses a special class of elliptic curves, namely twisted Edwards curves with an efficiently computable endomorphism similar to that of the socalled Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone (GLV) curves. This allows us to combine the main advantage of the GLV model, which is an efficiently-computable endomorphism to speed up variable-base scalar multiplication, with the fast and complete addition rules of the (twisted) Edwards model. We implemented variable-base scalar multiplication for static ECDH on two such curves, one over a 159-bit and the second over a 207-bit pseudo-Mersenne prime field, respectively, and evaluated their execution time on a 16-bit MSP430F1611 processor. The arithmetic operations in the prime field do not contain operand-dependent conditional statements (in particular no “if-then-else” clauses) and also the scalar multiplication follows a fixed execution path for a given (static) scalar. A variable-base scalar multiplication on curves over the 159 and 207-bit field takes about 2.63 and 4.84 million clock cycles, respectively, on an MSP430F1611 processor. These results compare favorably with the Montgomery ladder on the equivalent Montgomery curves, which is almost 50% slower.","2690-8557","978-1-7281-4134-3","10.1109/SIOT48044.2019.9637091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637091","IoT security;Lightweight cryptography;ECDH key exchange;twisted Edwards curve;Endomorphism","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Elliptic curves;Computational modeling;Conferences;Random access memory;Elliptic curve cryptography","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;public key cryptography","Edwards model;variable-base scalar multiplication;static ECDH;207-bit pseudoMersenne prime field;execution time;equivalent Montgomery curves;fast ECDH key exchange;twisted Edwards curves;efficiently computable endomorphism;public-key cryptosystems;IoT;battery-operated devices;wireless sensor nodes;Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange;fast execution times;elliptic curves;socalled Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone curves;efficiently-computable endomorphism;fast addition rules;complete addition rules","","","","30","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Approaches to manipulate the communication between ECUs for the purpose of security testing and reverse-engineering of vehicular functions have been presented in the past, all of which struggle with automating the detection of system change in response to message injection. In this paper we present our findings with fuzzing CAN networks, in particular while observing individual ECUs with a sensor harness. The harness detects physical responses, which we then use in a oracle functions to inform the fuzzing process. We systematically define fuzzers, fuzzing configurations and oracle functions for testing ECUs.

This is on the one hand due to the closed ecosystem putting obstacles in the way of reverse engineers and on the other hand due to the complexity of reverse engineering and analyzing app binaries. Reliably lifting accurate call graphs, control flows, and data dependence graphs from binary code, as well as reconstructing object-oriented high-level concepts is a non-trivial task and the choice of the lifted target representation determines the analysis capabilities. None of the various existing intermediate representations is a perfect fit for all types of analysis, while the detection of vulnerabilities requires techniques ranging from simple pattern matching to complex inter-procedural data flow analyses. We address this gap by introducing liOS, a binary lifting and analysis framework for iOS applications that extracts lifted information from several frontends and unifies them in a “supergraph” representation that tolerates missing parts and is further extended and interlinked by liOS “passes”. A static analysis of the binary is then realized in the form of graph traversal queries, which can be considered as an advancement of classic program query languages. We illustrate this approach by means of a typical JavaScript/Objective-C bridge, which can lead to remote code execution in iOS applications.","2690-8557","978-1-7281-4134-3","10.1109/SIOT48044.2019.9637076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637076","","Analytical models;Protocols;Operating systems;Reverse engineering;Static analysis;Mobile communication;Reliability","data flow analysis;graph theory;Java;mobile computing;object-oriented programming;pattern matching;program compilers;program diagnostics;query languages;query processing;reverse engineering;security of data","iOS apps;popular mobile operating system;iOS applications;generic app analysis frameworks;closed ecosystem;reverse engineers;reverse engineering;analyzing app binaries;accurate call graphs;control flows;data dependence graphs;binary code;object-oriented high-level concepts;nontrivial task;lifted target representation;analysis capabilities;intermediate representations;complex inter-procedural data flow analyses;introducing liOS;binary lifting;supergraph representation;static analysis;graph traversal queries","","1","","19","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As applications, we give an improved subconvexity bound for $\textrm{GL}_3\times \textrm{GL}_2$  $L$-functions in the $t$-aspect and under the Ramanujan--Petersson conjecture we derive the following bound for sums of $\textrm{GL}_3\times \textrm{GL}_2$ Fourier coefficients $$\begin{align*}& \sum_{r^2n\leq x}\lambda_{\pi}(r,n)\lambda_f(n)\ll_{\pi, f, \varepsilon} x^{5/7-1/364+\varepsilon} \end{align*}$$for any $\varepsilon>0$, which breaks for the 1st time the barrier $O(x^{5/7+\varepsilon })$ in a work by Friedlander–Iwaniec.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9619558","","","","","","","","","","18 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One of the most celebrated results of this type is the Ruzsa–Szemerédi triangle removal lemma, which states that if a graph is $\varepsilon $-far from being triangle free, then most subsets of vertices of size $C(\varepsilon )$ are not triangle free. Unfortunately, the best known upper bound on $C(\varepsilon )$ is given by a tower-type function, and it is known that $C(\varepsilon )$ is not polynomial in $\varepsilon ^{-1}$. The triangle removal lemma has been extended to many other graph properties, and for some of them the corresponding function $C(\varepsilon )$ is polynomial. This raised the natural question, posed by Goldreich in 2005 and more recently by Alon and Fox, of characterizing the properties for which one can prove removal lemmas with polynomial bounds. Our main results in this paper are new sufficient and necessary criteria for guaranteeing that a graph property admits a removal lemma with a polynomial bound. Although both are simple combinatorial criteria, they imply almost all prior positive and negative results of this type. Moreover, our new sufficient conditions allow us to obtain polynomially bounded removal lemmas for many properties for which the previously known bounds were of tower type. In particular, we show that every semi-algebraic graph property admits a polynomially bounded removal lemma. This confirms a conjecture of Alon.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnz214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9619540","","","","","","","","","","18 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These clumps of seaweed can make landfall and lead to large mats of material piling up very quickly over long stretches of beach. Once on land, the seaweed decays and exudes a distinct rotting smell which can be detrimental to tourism and quality of life in the area. The observed mass of Sargassum seaweed has grown noticeably since 2011 and doesn’t seem to be slowing down. The Sargassum has many oxygen-filled pneumatocysts, so it floats on the ocean surface over large areas. Given this information, we assume the Sargassum’s dynamics will be closely related to that of the surface currents themselves. Surface current data from High Frequency Radar (HFR) measurements along the south coast of Puerto Rico were used to produce animations of surface drift which revealed the general flow in the region. The surface current measurements were compared against the US Navy’s AMSEAS model to assess the model’s ability to estimate the flow in the region. Within this research program it was assumed that the velocity of the Sargassum should be similar to the surface currents. The HFR and model animations were examined over hourly, daily, and monthly time intervals. The ocean model captures the direction of transport well but appears to consistently predict faster currents than those measured by the HFR. The model estimates and the HFR measurements agree much of the time, however, there are some time periods where the model would not help with the tracking of the floating particles. This research revealed that the movement of the surface particles are typically westward, close to the southern shore of Puerto Rico during most of the time periods covered in our study. Sometimes a rapid change in this behavior was observed, where surface particles moved directly towards the southern shore of Puerto Rico, or toward the east. This information could possibly be made available for ecological and economic use by stakeholders and businesses on coastal tourism locations, as well as search-and-rescue use by Coast Guard or similar institutions.","0197-7385","978-0-578-57618-3","10.23919/OCEANS40490.2019.9593925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9593925","Sargassum;seaweed;AMSEAS;NCOM;remote sensing;HF radar","Sea surface;Atmospheric measurements;Tracking;Biological system modeling;Current measurement;Sea measurements;Predictive models","ecology;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques","Sargassum seaweed tracker;Caribbean;clumps;seaweed decays;distinct rotting smell;tourism;oxygen-filled pneumatocysts;ocean surface;surface current data;high frequency radar measurements;Puerto Rico;surface drift;surface current measurements;hourly time intervals;daily time intervals;monthly time intervals;ocean model;HFR measurements;floating particles;surface particles;US Navy AMSEAS model;Sargassum dynamics","","1","","9","","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some violent people can cause serious damage by carrying dangerous liquids at public places. There is a need of less expensive and more effective system for such public places. This paper forth puts a new cost-effective method to detect the suspicious liquids by using an ultrasonic sensor. The basic concept is to use time taken by the ultrasonic wave to travel for classification. The dataset is created by capturing the values of time taken by ultrasonic wave for different liquids. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm is used for classification.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555876","Ultrasonic sensor;suspicious;object detection;classification","Liquids;Computed tomography;Object detection;Acoustics;Linear discriminant analysis;Safety;Classification algorithms","hazardous materials;object detection;safety systems;ultrasonic transducers;ultrasonic waves","LDA;linear discriminant analysis;ultrasonic sensor;cost-effective method;dangerous liquids;CT scanners;security systems;safety systems;suspicious object detection;ultrasonic wave;suspicious liquids;public places","","","","25","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From data instances that correspond to the normal behavior of the network, the IDS learn the data model of normality which is known as inliers. Also, they detect the malicious activities that are capable of detecting intruders and generating the alarms when any illegitimate activity occurs in a cloud environment. As the cloud users are growing rapidly, the security and privacy concern also increase. As the users’ data are being managed by the third party, data protection has become a primary issue. So as to handle the mentioned issue, an IDS has been presented to find any malicious activity on a cloud environment that is capable of detecting intruders and sends a warning when any illegitimate activity occurs. For detecting normal and malicious data, the Adaptive artificial neural network (AANN) has been utilized in the proposed scheme. For optimally designing the training structure of presented AANN based IDS, the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) has been utilized in the novel approach. This further enhances the intrusion detection. Then the homomorphic reencryption technique has been utilized for improving the security further. Further, a third party auditing (TPA) has been performed for checking the data periodically. Finally, the data have been stored in the cloud. Using the cloud simulator, the presented scheme has been implemented in the working platform of Java software.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555878","Intrusion detection system;artificial neural network;grasshopper optimization algorithm;homomorphic re-encryption;third party auditing;cloud computing","Training;Adaptive systems;Simulation;Software algorithms;Intrusion detection;Memory;Artificial neural networks","cloud computing;cryptography;data protection;Java;neural nets;optimisation;storage management","Java software;TPA;third party auditing;GOA;security concern;malicious activities;homomorphic reencryption algorithm;cloud simulator;grasshopper optimization algorithm;adaptive artificial neural network;data protection;cloud users;cloud environment;malicious activity;IDS;data instances;system behavior;data traffic;computer systems;communication networks;intrusion detection systems;adaptive ANN;privacy preserving secure data storage scheme","","","","12","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper puts forward a novel and efficient methodology for Steiner nodes refinement and thus finding out the most constructive Steiner vertices, which, apart from reducing the computational burden, also minimizes the overall routing length, and that too with a much lesser execution time.

For testing the model, an open source data set has been used. A total of 3790 images are collected from more than six plants, which carry more than 11 types of disease. Data Augmentation has been used to strengthen the training dataset. The application of data augmentation has increased the accuracy from 72% to 92%. The advantage of Transfer learning has been exploited in the current work. Google Inception V3 model is used to train the data set.

This is a part of Rajarhat C.D. Block. Escalating land use practice has lead to a dynamic transformation in the local land cover and associated micro environment of this region. Replacement of vegetation with concrete surfaces has caused problems of natural resource depletion without any attention paid to environmental sustainability. The study aims to identify the negative impacts of urban growth in this region, for the latest decade i.e. from 2009 to 2019. Loss of natural resource, as vegetation was monitored by mapping Fractional Vegetation Cover (FCOVER) index over time. Transforming the natural vegetation with built up surfaces also modifies the local climate of a city region. As an indicative climatic parameter Land Surface Temperature (LST) was considered. Landsat satellite images were processed for identifying the environmental degradation over time. Through areal change detection, nearly 40% vegetation loss was observed. Landscape metric analysis has been carried out for a better understanding of structural characteristics of this vegetation cover parameter. The analysis showed fragmentation and reducing density for vegetation patches over the area. The combined effect of vegetation loss and urbanization resulted in a rising LST patterns. New heat islands have been spotted and are found to grow spatially. This was established by statistically relating FCOVER with LST. The negative correlation between vegetation and temperature was found to be significant at α0.01. The critical areas of heat islands have been identified which urgently needs implementation of mitigation. Thus the study helps to build a database for future landscape planning and environment management.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555874","Landsat satellite imageries;Urban sprawl;FCOVER;LST","Measurement;Satellites;Green buildings;Urban areas;Vegetation mapping;Land surface;Land surface temperature","atmospheric temperature;geophysical image processing;land cover;land surface temperature;land use planning;thermal pollution;vegetation mapping","heat islands;structural characteristics;built up surfaces;natural resource;AD 2009 to 2019;severe urban sprawl;infrastructural development;indian satellite Town;urban sprawl;local environment;environment management;rising LST patterns;urbanization;vegetation patches;vegetation cover parameter;landscape metric analysis;vegetation loss;areal change detection;environmental degradation;landsat satellite images;indicative climatic parameter Land Surface Temperature;city region;local climate;natural vegetation;mapping Fractional Vegetation Cover;latest decade;urban growth;environmental sustainability;natural resource depletion;concrete surfaces;microenvironment;local land cover;dynamic transformation;land use practice;Rajarhat C.D.

And the collection, transport, processing, disposal and monitoring of these wastes is called as Industrial Waste Management. Industrial Waste has adhered to severe pollution to air, water and soil in the recent years affecting environment and human health. So, its proper and effective management has become important also as the industries’ liability towards the environment. Since many industries don’t have in-house processing plants, they tie-up with industries for the task. This paper focuses on using Q-learning for effective path-planning from generator industries(waste generating) to aggregator industries(waste processing). Q-learning is used for predicting the most efficient path by learning from its own experiences of rewards and penalties and so we don’t need to train the model which therefore increases the efficiency. This work can be implemented at a place where industrial waste is generated and can be very helpful in managing the same. This could be implemented as a service and handed over to the probable customers or government organizations which provide waste management services to the industries. This submission is a step towards automation of the Industrial Waste Management and helps in planning of waste management in real-time.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555893","Reinforcement learning;Q-learning;Industrial Waste;Waste-Management","Waste management;Industries;Industrial waste;Soil;Solids;Water pollution;Real-time systems","air pollution;industrial plants;industrial pollution;industrial waste;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;real-time systems;soil pollution;waste management;water pollution","real time waste management planning;soil pollution;water pollution;air pollution;q-learning;waste management services;waste processing;gaseous wastes;liquid wastes;solid wastes;industrial waste management","","","","17","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many clusters based routing protocols which work on different techniques of cluster formation that leads to energy loss. Usage of the same cluster head and routes may lead to excess energy drop of nodes near to sink in WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Here, we propose a technique using which energy can be saved during cluster formation and used in routing. The proposed mechanism also allows different nodes to get a chance to become a cluster head. In this proposed algorithm, new clusters are formed after each interval, hence new routes are followed for data transmission which results in balanced energy consumption. Therefore, no particular node is overexploited and the task is distributed among all nodes. Moreover, the performance of the proposed mechanism is measured and compared with the existing kmeans algorithm.

The huge number of wireless sensor devices are interconnected to form a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) which completes the IoT infrastructure. These sensor devices have many functionalities, such as data sensing, data transmission, intercommunication, computation, etc. The IoT devices sense and monitor the ambient conditions such as temperature, pressure, humidity, movements, speed, etc. of objects around it and convert that sensed signal to an electric signal. The received signal is processed, and useful information is extracted out of it, and the information is transmitted to a data center. These sensor networks have many applications in the field of military surveillance, healthcare, industries, environmental, etc. Mostly, the battery is the only source of energy for a node, and it is quite difficult to recharge node batteries. Hence, the design of proper routing protocol is required to extend the network lifetime. Many routing techniques have been proposed to solve this problem. All the energy efficient protocols that were proposed can be classified into three types, namely flat, hierarchical, and location-based protocols. In this paper, various energy efficient, position-aware state-of-art routing protocols based on their network structure are analyzed.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555864","Internet of Things;Hot Spot Problem;WSN-Assisted IoT;Routing Protocol;Green IoT","Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Temperature measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Routing;Routing protocols","Internet of Things;protocols;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","WSN assisted IoT infrastructure;powerful system;universal system;checking;physical condition;wireless sensor devices;Wireless Sensor Network;data sensing;data transmission;IoT devices sense;ambient conditions;sensed signal;electric signal;received signal;data center;sensor networks;military surveillance;node batteries;proper routing protocol;network lifetime;routing techniques;energy efficient protocols;location-based protocols;state-of-art routing protocols;network structure","","1","","14","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The PV module is designed with INC MPPT technology and the shunt active power filter is connected at the AC side of the inverter integrated with a nonlinear rectifier load. The harmonics in load voltage, load current and source current are present due to connection of nonlinear load and intermittent PV power generation. The presence of harmonics in the power system may cause severe harm such as component overheating, increase in installation and consumer cost, malfunctioning of equipment, unusual tripping of circuit breakers, failure of sensors and noisy communication. To overcome all the above problems Filters are to be designed. Here a shunt active power filter designed to suppress the harmonic effects produced in the PV based system. Here the shunt active power filter design includes the PI controller whose gains are selected arbitrary which affects its performance. In the first study the total harmonic distortion (THD) is calculated with no filter and nonlinear load. Then THD Analysis is performed with shunt active power filter. Further to improve the performance of shunt active power filter, a hybrid optimization technique is applied to select the proper value of PI gains R and L of nonlinear load. The simulation result depicts that the optimized shunt active filter reduces harmonics to a great extent.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555896","Shunt active filter;INC;Maximum power point tracking;THD","Power filters;PI control;Simulation;Photovoltaic cells;Voltage;Active filters;Harmonic analysis","active filters;harmonic distortion;invertors;maximum power point trackers;optimisation;photovoltaic power systems;PI control;power harmonic filters;power supply quality;reactive power control","shunt active power filter design;THD analysis;PV based system;total harmonic distortion;INC MPPT technology;photovoltaic cell based shunt active filter;hybrid optimization technique;solar cell based shunt active power filter;circuit breaker tripping;harmonic estimation;reactive power compensation","","","","11","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The greater part of the servers of the cloud server farms is so overladen because of expanding requests and diverse sorts of errands that it leads to load imbalance within the cloud setting, thus influencing the execution of the framework. Asset designation in the cloud is an NP-hard issue and numerous algorithms have been put forward to take care of this issue of asset distribution. In this study, we have addressed the problem by proposing a resource allocation strategy for finding the best-fit VM and assuring maximum resource utilization while meeting the deadline and budget constraint.

In this study, the possible future climate induced effect on the water and energy balance of the Beas river basin was evaluated using VIC-glacier model. In Beas river basin the increment of annual rainfall during the period 2006-2040 and 2041-2070 is 9-12% with respect to 1970-2005. There is a 64% reduction of deciduous broadleaf forest and a 65% increase of grassland by 2030. The hydrology model projects a general increase of rainfall-induced runoff, glaciermelt and the reduction in snowmelt as compared to historical climate data (1970-2005). This can be due to the warming climate and increased precipitation in future. The total runoff for this basin increases moderately by 6-17.0% during the period 2006-2040 and 2041-2070. The rainfall-induced runoff has a major contribution to the discharge where the runoff input from snowmelt and glaciermelt is moderate.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555850","CORDEX;Discharge;Glaciermelt;VIC-Glacier;Snowmelt","Temperature measurement;Hydrology;Climate change;Snow;Forestry;Discharges (electric);Data models","atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric temperature;climatology;glaciology;hydrology;rain;rivers;snow;water resources","hydrologic impact assessment;glaciated BEAS river basin;high resolution climate simulations;CORDEX regional climate models;changing environment;significant climate variability analysis;hydrologic response;principle consideration;sustainable water resource;possible future climate;energy balance;VIC-glacier model;annual rainfall;hydrology model projects;general increase;rainfall-induced runoff;historical climate data;warming climate","","","","15","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the present study, desertification vulnerability assessment was carried out using geographic information system (GIS) for mapping sensitive areas using Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use (MEDALUS) approach, which identifies such sensitive areas on the basis of an index in which environmental quality as well as anthropogenic factors are included as layers for Surendranagar district of Gujarat state in India. Many aspects of vulnerability arising from natural and human factors were considered in this study. Soil, climate, land utilization, geography and vegetation contribute in the land degradation of any area. Indices related to these factors have been generated. Socio-economic factor is a one of the major input to assess desertification vulnerability as anthropogenic activities.

Blockchain is the underlying technology that is responsible for maintaining the bitcoin transaction ledger. It can be defined as a chain of blocks such that each block holds some information. The information stored is dependent on the type of blockchain and can be referred to as a digital signature. The digital signature of the next block is based on the digital signature of the current block and the digital signature of the next block is based on the previous block signature. Blockchain is a fast-evolving technology that is eventually replacing the current transaction management system. The problems that are being faced by the current transaction system such as the transaction costs, crisis and crashes due to depression and fractional reserve banking, blockchain helps to solve these issues. Blockchain is not limited to the transaction system and can be used in other fields also. The property fraudulent cases are becoming very common these days, the reason being centralized control and no public access to data and absence of a system to cross-check the property for which transaction is being made. In this paper, we focus to discuss on issues like centralized control, how the blockchain technology will benefit and help to overcome the issues in any kind of property fraud cases and what are the major challenges to this technology implementation.","","978-1-7281-3709-4","10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555856","Blockchain;Hash;Bitcoin;Crypto currency;Property Management System","Costs;Online banking;Bitcoin;Depression;Computer crashes;Blockchains;Digital signatures","blockchains;centralised control;cryptocurrencies;digital signatures;fraud;transaction processing","digital signature;transaction costs;blockchain technology;property fraud detection;digital currency;bitcoin transaction ledger;transaction management system;block signature;third-party control;fractional reserve banking;property fraudulent cases;centralized control;public access","","","","7","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, comparatively fewer studies have experimented with CNN-based classifiers to classify intra-urban characteristics with open mid and low-resolution earth observation (EO) datasets. The current pace of urbanization necessitates understanding and mapping of inherent urban forms, which would further assist in devising policies pertaining to sustainable urban development. While several remote sensing methods have been utilized to understand the urban structure, the replicability and generalizability of such approaches have been some of the key limitations. This study creates the CNN model to identify the degrees of built arrangement in mid resolution Sentinel 2B imagery of ten largest Indian cities. Training and testing datasets for seven land cover classes such as compact, open, sparse built, paved, unpaved, greens, and water are manually created with the help of Google Earth Pro platform. The definitions of the classes are acquired from the LCZ classification scheme. The CNN model trained with the prepared dataset provides the overall accuracy of 90% and kappa value of 0.88. The classification results are plotted for each city and compared with each other.

Schneider",NA,"Artificial You: AI and the Future of Your Mind","","2019","","","","","Hailed by the Washington Post as “a sure-footed and witty guide to slippery ethical terrain,” a philosophical exploration of AI and the future of the mind that Astronomer Royal Martin Rees calls “profound and entertaining”Humans may not be Earth’s most intelligent beings for much longer: the world champions of chess, Go, and Jeopardy! are now all AIs. Given the rapid pace of progress in AI, many predict that it could advance to human-level intelligence within the next several decades. From there, it could quickly outpace human intelligence. What do these developments mean for the future of the mind?In Artificial You, Susan Schneider says that it is inevitable that AI will take intelligence in new directions, but urges that it is up to us to carve out a sensible path forward. As AI technology turns inward, reshaping the brain, as well as outward, potentially creating machine minds, it is crucial to beware. Homo sapiens, as mind designers, will be playing with ""tools"" they do not understand how to use: the self, the mind, and consciousness. Schneider argues that an insufficient grasp of the nature of these entities could undermine the use of AI and brain enhancement technology, bringing about the demise or suffering of conscious beings. To flourish, we must grasp the philosophical issues lying beneath the algorithms.At the heart of her exploration is a sober-minded discussion of what AI can truly achieve: Can robots really be conscious? Can we merge with AI, as tech leaders like Elon Musk and Ray Kurzweil suggest? Is the mind just a program? Examining these thorny issues, Schneider proposes ways we can test for machine consciousness, questions whether consciousness is an unavoidable byproduct of sophisticated intelligence, and considers the overall dangers of creating machine minds.","","9780691197777","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9519788.pdf&bkn=9519687&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","20 Aug 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Requirements variability motivates adaptability; hence, understanding the influence of the domain changes, i.e. context variability, to requirements variability is necessary. In this paper, we propose an approach for context-based requirements variability analysis in the goal-oriented requirements modelling. We define contextual goals and contextual preferences to specify the relationships of contexts with requirements and preferences, respectively. Given a requirements problem represented through a goal model, we use the contextual goals to derive applicable solutions at a given situation. Then, from those applicable solutions, we use the contextual preferences as criteria for evaluating and selecting the ones that would best satisfy stakeholder priorities. To support our variability analysis, we develop a tool to automate the derivation and evaluation of the solutions. We further demonstrate the use of our approach in detecting modelling errors and validating the impact of prioritizations, leading to improvements in the requirements specifications. Our approach broadens the scope of requirements variability by weaving context variability with both stakeholder goals and preferences, in order to sufficiently represent the adaptability needs of software systems where contextual changes are commonplace.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514717","contextual preferences;goal modelling;variability analysis;software adaptability;requirements;context-aware","","","","","","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In a TFD scheme, messages are encrypted under public keys as that in a standard PKE scheme, but both private keys (i.e. the first factor) and biometric inputs (i.e. the second factor) are required to decrypt the ciphertexts and obtain the underlying plaintexts. We first describe a framework of TFD, and then define a formal security model for TFD.

In this paper, we eliminate the issues of the Yakubov et al.’s scheme and propose a new PKI architecture based on permissioned blockchain with PBFT consensus mechanism where the consensus nodes utilize a dynamic threshold signature scheme to generate signed blocks. In this way, the trust to the intermediary entities can be completely eliminated during certificate validation. Our scheme enjoys the dynamic property of the threshold signature because TLS clients do not have to change the verification key even if the validator set is dynamic. We implement our proposal on private Ethereum network to demonstrate the experimental results. The results show that our proposal has negligible overhead during TLS handshake.

The power of crowd computing stems from a large number of workers potentially available to provide high quality of service and reduce costs. An important challenge in the crowdsourcing market today is the task allocation of crowdsourcing workflows. Task allocation aims to maximize the completion quality of the entire workflow and minimize its total cost. Trust can affect the quality of the produced results and costs. Selecting workers with high levels of trust could provide better solution to the workflow and increase the budget. Crowdsourcing workflow needs to balance the two conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose an alternative greedy approach with four heuristic strategies to address the issue. In particular, the proposed approach aims to monitor the current status of workflow execution and use heuristic strategies to adjust the parameters of task allocation. We design a two-phase allocation model to accurately match the tasks with workers. T-Aware allocates each task to the worker that maximizes the trust level, while minimizing the cost. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively evaluate the proposed algorithms in terms of running time, task failure ratio, trust and cost using a customer objective function on WorkflowSim, a well-known cloud simulation tool. Experimental results based on real-world workflows show that T-Aware outperforms other optimal solutions on finding the tradeoff between trust and cost, which is 3 to 6% better than the best competitor algorithm.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514732","crowdsourcing workflow;task allocation;trust;scientific workflow","","","","","1","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the same context, the real-time middleware data distribution service (DDS) is an appropriate alternative for the standard vehicular middleware considering that it handles quality of service (QoS) parameters including real-time ones. In this paper, we are proposing a new approach for DDS implementation and integration into the vehicular system by creating a model-based design blocks. To validate this implementation, we have used the case of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) vehicle benchmark as a simulation and test model. Therefore, we designed a Simulink vehicle as specified by SAE benchmark. Then, we have introduced a new methodology to link each module to a Simulink DDS blockset. The goal of this approach is to facilitate the use of DDS with vehicular controllers and to reduce the deployment and configuration complexities associated with DDS. It will also enable distributed real-time embedded systems developers to concentrate more on the business logic of the application instead of the low-level implementation details. The final developed architecture has been tested using three different types of real-time networks: FlexRay, Gigabit Ethernet and AFDX, to demonstrate that real-time application’s QoS are always met using this model.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514727","DDS;latency;GBE;AFDX;FlexRay;SAE benchmark","","","","","","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This paper focuses on several important issues on the new formalism. First, the theoretical framework of CGG is given.

Heuristic embedding algorithms generally make embedding decisions by artificially specified strategies, in which the node importance is measured by simply summing or multiplying several node attributes. However, the contributions of different attributes may be combined through complex functional relationships. The reinforcement learning-based VNE algorithms can optimize node embedding. However, the existing algorithms only consider the local node attributes, and only simple shortest path-based embedding policy is adopted for link embedding, resulting limited embedding effects. To overcome the above defects, we propose a double-layer reinforcement learning-based VNE algorithm (DRL-VNE). In DRL-VNE, both the global and local node attributes are extracted to represent the status of network nodes, then a policy network is constructed to optimize node embedding, and the other policy network is designed to optimize link embedding. The performance of DRL-VNE is evaluated under different network scenarios and is compared with that of heuristic and machine learning-based VNE algorithms. Simulation results show that in hierarchical network scenario, the request acceptance ratio and the resource utilization of DRL-VNE are respectively improved by 14% and by 27% compared with the best performance comparison algorithm.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxab040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514735","network virtualization;virtual network embedding;reinforcement learning;two-phase embedding","","","","","","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Under the MM∗ model, a variety of interconnection networks’ $g$-extra diagnosability have been investigated, such as hypercube, folded hypercube, $(n,k)$-star network, alternating group graph, etc. These results mostly share similar derivation processes to derive the $g$-extra diagnosability of involved networks by using the $g$-extra connectivity.

It deals with the complexity and characteristics of haptic interfaces to apply the record and playback technique. Our approach also provides inference rules to identify possible faulty modules of the system under testing. A case study was performed with three systems: a system with primitive virtual objects, a dental anesthesia simulator and a game. Faulty versions of the systems were created by seeding faults manually and by using mutation operators. The results showed that 100% of the manually seeded faults and 93% of mutants were detected.

Often, this need for composition can be reduced by rewriting toward queries using semi-joins instead, resulting in a significant reduction of the query evaluation cost. We study techniques to recognize and apply such rewritings. Concretely, we study the relationship between the expressive power of the relation algebras, which heavily rely on composition, and the semi-join algebras, which replace composition in favor of semi-joins. Our main result is that each fragment of the relation algebras where intersection and/or difference is only used on edges (and not on complex compositions) is expressively equivalent to a fragment of the semi-join algebras. This expressive equivalence holds for node queries evaluating to sets of nodes. For practical relevance, we exhibit constructive rules for rewriting relation algebra queries to semi-join algebra queries and prove that they lead to only a well-bounded increase in the number of steps needed to evaluate the rewritten queries. In addition, on sibling-ordered trees, we establish new relationships among the expressive power of Regular XPath, Conditional XPath, FO-logic and the semi-join algebra augmented with restricted fixpoint operators.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514723","graph query optimization;relation algebra;semi-join algebra;rewriting;transitive closure;restricted transitive closure;expressiveness","","","","","1","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These challenges are because of the increased usage of large volumes of data. These huge amounts of data are presented from large-scale distributed networks. Centralization of these data to carry out analysis is tricky. There exists a requirement for novel text document clustering algorithms, which overcomes challenges in clustering. The two most important challenges in clustering are clustering accuracy and quality. For this reason, this paper intends to present an ideal clustering model for text document using term frequency–inverse document frequency, which is considered as feature sets. Here, the initial centroid selection is much concentrated which can automatically cluster the text using weighted similarity measure in the proposed clustering process. In fact, the weighted similarity function involves the inter-cluster, and intra-cluster similarity of both ordered and unordered documents, which is used to minimize weighted similarity among the documents. An advanced model for clustering is proposed by the hybrid optimization algorithm, which is the combination of the Jaya Algorithm (JA) and Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO), and so the proposed algorithm is termed as JA-based GWO. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is verified through a comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art models. The performance analysis exhibits that the proposed model is 96.56% better than genetic algorithm, 99.46% better than particle swarm optimization, 97.09% superior to Dragonfly algorithm, and 96.21% better than JA for the similarity index. Therefore, the proposed model has confirmed its efficiency through valuable analysis.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxab013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514734","text document clustering;term frequency;inverse document frequency;Jaya algorithm;Grey Wolf algorithm;hybrid concept","","","","","1","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

CIT has been widely used in different applications, with many algorithms and tools having been proposed to support CA construction. To date, however, there appears to have been no studies comparing different CA constructors when only some of the CA test cases are executed. In this paper, we present an investigation of five popular CA constructors: ACTS, Jenny, PICT, CASA and TCA. We conducted empirical studies examining the five programs, focusing on interaction coverage and fault detection. The experimental results show that when there is no preference or special justification for using other CA constructors, then Jenny is recommended—because it achieves better interaction coverage and fault detection than the other four constructors in many cases. Our results also show that when using ACTS or CASA, their CAs must be prioritized before testing. The main reason for this is that these CAs can result in considerable interaction coverage or fault detection capabilities when executing a large number of test cases; however, they may also produce the lowest rates of fault detection and interaction coverage.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514722","combinatorial interaction testing;covering array;constructor;empirical study;software testing","","","","","1","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This work introduces a novel pixel prediction scheme-based image steganography to overcome the complexity issues prevailing in the existing works. In the proposed pixel prediction scheme, the support vector neural network (SVNN) classifier is utilized for the construction of a prediction map, which identifies the suitable pixels for the embedding process. Then, in the embedding phase, wavelet coefficients are extracted from the medical image based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and embedding strength, and the secret message is embedded into the HL wavelet band. Finally, the secret message is extracted from the medical image on applying the DWT. The experimentation of the proposed pixel prediction scheme is done by utilizing the medical images from the BRATS database.

However, the automatic search methods, no matter based on MILP, SMT/SAT or CP techniques, can be inefficient when the search space is too large. In this paper, we propose three new methods to improve Matsui’s branch-and-bound search algorithm, which is known as the first generic algorithm for finding the best differential and linear trails. The three methods, named reconstructing DDT and LAT according to weight, executing linear layer operations in minimal cost and merging two 4-bit S-boxes into one 8-bit S-box, respectively, can efficiently speed up the search process by reducing the search space as much as possible and reducing the cost of executing linear layer operations. We apply our improved algorithm to DESL and GIFT, which are still the hard instances for the automatic search methods. As a result, we find the best differential trails for DESL (up to 14-round) and GIFT-128 (up to 19-round). The best linear trails for DESL (up to 16-round), GIFT-128 (up to 10-round) and GIFT-64 (up to 15-round) are also found. To the best of our knowledge, these security bounds for DESL and GIFT under single-key scenario are given for the first time. Meanwhile, it is the longest exploitable (differential or linear) trails for DESL and GIFT. Furthermore, benefiting from the efficiency of the improved algorithm, we do experiments to demonstrate that the clustering effect of differential trails for 13-round DES and DESL are both weak.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514712","Matsui’s search algorithm;differential trail;linear trail;clustering effect;DESL;GIFT-128;GIFT-64;DES","","","","","","","","","16 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

On the other hand, the existing call centers lack a professional knowledge base and the method of automatically calling the knowledge base in real-time, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of users wanting to obtain knowledge in a timely manner. To address these problems, a call center embedded in an expert system inference algorithm and knowledge base for farmers to obtain agricultural knowledge through mobile phones or fixed-line telephones was established. By studying the event-condition-action-based (ECA-based) database triggering model, remote method invocation-based (RMI-based) communication and iterative dichotomiser 3 algorithm-based (ID3-based) parameter extraction, the cohesion between the call center and the expert system was realized. The agricultural knowledge audio acquisition model was then coupled with the call center and the expert system was constructed, allowing farmers to acquire agricultural knowledge through mobile phones or fixed phones with fast responses. When used for cotton disease diagnosis, it can achieve a high diagnostic success rate (above 75%) when at least three disease symptoms are input into the expert system via the voice call, which provides an effective channel for Chinese farmers to obtain agricultural knowledge.

On the other hand, due to the nature of ABE, a malicious user may abuse its decryption privilege. Therefore, being able to identify such a malicious user is crucial towards the practicality of ABE. Although some specific ABE schemes in the literature enjoys the tracing function, they are only proceeded case by case. Most of the ABE schemes do not support traceability. It is thus meaningful and important to have a generic way of equipping any ABE scheme with traceability. In this work, we partially solve the aforementioned problem. Namely, we propose a way of transforming (non-traceable) ABE schemes satisfying certain requirements to fully collusion-resistant black-box traceable ABE schemes, which adds only $O(\sqrt{\mathcal{K}})$ elements to the ciphertext where ${\mathcal{K}}$ is the number of users in the system.

The core idea of CMT is to combine the strengths of both decision-tree and tuple-space schemes by employing tree-like structures and hash tables simultaneously. The objective of CMT is to achieve both high classification performance and fast rule updates. In the evaluation section, CMT is compared with decision-tree and tuple-space schemes. Compared to the state-of-the-art decision-tree methods, CMT performs rule updates at two orders of magnitude faster.

Motivated by parallel routing in networks with faults, Oh and Chen (resp., Qiao and Yang) proposed the (fault-tolerant) strong Menger (edge) connectivity as follows. A graph $G$ is called $m$-strongly Menger (edge) connected if $G-F$ remains strongly Menger (edge) connected for an arbitrary vertex set $F\subseteq V(G)$ (resp. edge set $F\subseteq E(G)$) with $|F|\leq m$.

In this paper, we consider strong Menger (edge) connectedness of the augmented $k$-ary $n$-cube $AQ_{n,k}$, which is a variant of $k$-ary $n$-cube $Q_n^k$.

Moreover, we obtain that $AQ_{n,k}$ is $(8n-10)$-conditional strongly Menger edge connected for $n\geq 2$ and $k\geq 3$.

Wind energy integration is increasing in worldwide each year. To efficiently investigate a quality voltage for AC loads under wind speed variations, a combined control strategy is proposed in this paper. It consists of PI and model predictive control (MPC) for the three-phase rectifier and interlinking inverter, respectively. The controlled rectifier ensures a constant DC-bus voltage under variable wind speed, while MPC is used to control output AC load voltage under abrupt load changes. Unlike traditional controllers, MPC does not require PI controllers for inner current and outer voltage loop or complex modulation steps. The discrete state-space model of VSI, LC filter, and load currents are used to predict future trends of load voltage for each of eight switching states. The control strategy selects the optimal switching state that reduces the error difference between reference and predicted load voltage. The proposed scheme is tested under perturbation of generation and load parameters. The proposed MPC strategy is compared with the conventional method-based PI controllers.

It uses the difference between slope lines to find and choose the smallest angle located between slope of straight line from mobile robot to goal point and slope from mobile robot and two endpoints of edges for obstacle, by choosing the smallest one which refers to nearest leave point to reach goal point and repeat this action with other obstacles until mobile robot reach to goal point. this algorithm based on using on-board sensors to generate information about the environment and obstacle located in front of mobile robot. This algorithm creates better performance when compared to the other traditional algorithms. It provides real time obstacle avoidance, compatible with LIDAR sensor and fast enough to be implemented on embedded microcontrollers. The used algorithm is based on a modification for existing path planning and obstacle voidance algorithms (Bug1, Bug2, Tangent-Bug, K-Bug, Dist-Bug ......etc.), and The Vector Field Histogram (VFH) Algorithm in unknown environment. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it is not limited to the origin-destiny line and changes the main line every leave point. MATLAB 2018a is used in simulation to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and it is implemented on multiple scenarios to show the ability of the mobile robot to follow a path, detect obstacles, and navigate around them to avoid collision.","","978-1-7281-5276-9","10.1109/ICCTA48790.2019.9478801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478801","Path planning;Collision avoidance;Bug algorithm;Autonomous mobile robots;LIDAR;nonholonomic","Laser radar;Three-dimensional displays;Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Robot sensing systems;Path planning","collision avoidance;microcontrollers;mobile robots;navigation;optical radar;real-time systems","embedded microcontrollers;LIDAR sensor;2D environment;new real time algorithm;sensor based path planning;real time obstacle avoidance;mobile robot reach;nearest leave point;goal point;nonholonomic robot;M-Bug;vector field histogram algorithm;Dist-Bug;K-Bug;Tangent-Bug;Bug2;Bug1","","","","15","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning techniques could considerably reduce the cost of examination processes and improve the speed and quality of diagnosis. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to classify GI diseases using machine learning techniques. The proposed method consists of 4 steps; image pre-processing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. First the images are resized. Afterwards, the discrete wavelets transform (DWT) and histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) are used as feature extraction methods. Next, the feature data were reduced by utilizing principle component analysis (PCA) and single value decomposition (SVD). Finally, the reduced features are used to train different classifiers. Results show that classification with complex decision tree achieved an accuracy of 99.8% using SVD method. The results were compared with recent related work. The comparison showed that the proposed approach is capable of diagnosis and classification of GI diseases compared to other work. Thus, it can be used to help medical experiments in investigation procedures.","","978-1-7281-5276-9","10.1109/ICCTA48790.2019.9478820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478820","Gastrointestinal (GI) Diseases;Feature Reduction;Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT);Histograms of Oriented gradient (HOG)","Histograms;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Gastrointestinal tract;Discrete wavelet transforms;Decision trees;Medical diagnostic imaging","decision trees;discrete wavelet transforms;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;principal component analysis;singular value decomposition;wavelet transforms","feature reduction;feature extraction methods;feature data;single value decomposition;reduced features;GI diseases;automatic classification;gastrointestinal diseases;common diseases;GI tract;machine learning techniques","","2","","13","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pushing for better systems is a challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a model consists of direct and emulated recursive forecasting strategies. The model inputs are a decomposed sub time series of the original data. To improve the forecast accuracy, proper modeling of features, capturing the dependencies in the direct forecast. Decomposing the time-series dataset into feature-based sub-series, allow the model to benefit from higher predictability characteristics, in addition to utilizing the power of direct forecast strategy. Next, feeding back predictions of sub-series in a cyclic manner produces n-step predictions in a row, which achieves the target of the multi-step forecast while avoiding accumulated feedback error in a multi-step recursive strategy.

Existing methods cause over-amplifying, and occasionally it yields checkerboards of the improved image due to which we may lose the important information in the X-ray image. Therefore, this work implements a simple guideline in order to build small application for medical image enhancement using global histogram equalization that is the enhanced version of histogram equalization technique, which improves the image quality by enlarging the vigorous assortment of the intensity by the histogram of the entire image. The method was tested on publicly available X-ray dataset. The average recognition rate across the dataset specifies the achievement of utilizing the proposed method for image enhancement.","","978-1-7281-5276-9","10.1109/ICCTA48790.2019.9478834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478834","Medical imaging;global histogram equalization;X-rays","Training;Histograms;Working environment noise;Lighting;Task analysis;X-ray imaging;Image enhancement","diseases;image enhancement;image segmentation;medical image processing;X-ray imaging","image quality;ray image enhancement;global histogram equalization;medical image processing;input image;testing images;accurate enhancement;improved image;X-ray image;medical image enhancement;histogram equalization technique","","","","18","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The digital world is becoming increasingly intertwined with the physical world of machines, to which it is bringing ubiquitous intelligence and a perpetual flow of information. These trends are driving us towards a very different future. That future has already started. A new wave of social, economic, and psychological changes is expected to abruptly affect almost everything we do. With change, many opportunities come along. Those who anticipate the course of the future, and prepare for it, will be ready to seize these opportunities and will come out winners. Those who chose to ignore the signs of change, will risk losing their livelihood and eventually hurting their families, businesses, and societies. Those who see the storm coming but react by standing still in panic, disgruntlement, and lamentation will be defenseless when the inevitable waves hit their shores. This presentation overviews the trends in technology and applications, including Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Robotics, Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, etc. The impact that such advances are likely to have on the high-tech as well as the low-tech job markets is outlined.

This movement could be between different nodes or between different levels of memory in the same node. It could decrease requests to fetch data from memory to higher speed cache memory, resulting in a decrease in cache miss ratio. Additionally, it may decrease the energy/power consumption. This assumption applies to a wide spectrum of architectures such as single core, multicores, many-cores, multi-nodes, warehouse scale computing, and Domain Specific Architectures (DSA). The revolutionary approach of hardware manufacturing suggests that the gap between computing, and data movements, both in memory subsystems and interconnection networks will continue to widen. Therefore, minimizing communications is an essential goal to achieve better utilization of modern architectures. In this paper, we study the impact of the data layout re-organization to minimize communications in parallel programs. The proposed technique is based on the ordering and partitioning of the Value Communications Graph (VCG) as a representative of the communications in the program. The evaluation work is carried out using a stack distance analysis of the program. The ordering and partitioning of the VCG is conducted using METIS, a graph ordering and partitioning tool.","","978-1-7281-5276-9","10.1109/ICCTA48790.2019.9478826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478826","Parallelization;Performance;Reuse Distance analysis;Variable Distance;metis;cache oblivious;data layout organization","Multicore processing;Multiprocessor interconnection;Layout;Cache memory;Organizations;Tools;Hardware","cache storage;graph theory;memory architecture;parallel programming","data layout organization effect;parallel programs;data movement;cache memory;cache miss ratio;many-cores;warehouse scale computing;domain specific architecture;modern architectures;data layout re-organization;value communications graph","","","","20","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many types of research have presented solutions for building an adaptive e-learning environment based on the student LS using Felder Silverman model either through questionnaire or by automatic detection through literature-based method, neural networks, however the obstacle in using Questionnaire only was that the answers won't be accurate as the student can just choose any answer to finish the questionnaire, and If it's depending on the automatic detection only it will take time till the student interact with the provided system to be able to conclude the student behavior. In our paper we will be combining both techniques with the help of the Ontology to detect the accurate student LS and detect the student knowledge through the complexity measurement of each question using six measures: A) external domain references, B) explicitness, C) linguistic complexity, D) conceptual complexity, E) level of difficulty F) intellectual complexity (Bloom level) to detect the knowledge level of the student.

RFID technology helps applications to grow because of the low price of RFID components.

In this paper, we propose a mean-field variational Bayesian inference based on a 3-state RFID model that finds the nearest optimal density distribution to RFID posterior distribution. Our model takes advantage of redundancy and prior knowledge of tags location to improve data quality and take into account the environment constraints of target application to raise the accuracy of cleaned data. Our proposed technique efficiently manages and reduce uncertainty of RFID data in large scale traceability networks.

Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is used where selecting, comparing and ranking of different Criteria of multiple alternatives is a requirement. Cloud providers present all kinds of cloud services, but they vary in quality, costs, customer experience, and service delivery. One of the problems with current cloud computing is the commitment of cloud service providers to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) with cloud providers users, but there are little verification frameworks to verify that cloud service providers provide cloud services according to their commitment. In the current literature, there is a lack of assessment models that provide the true status of cloud providers to cloud users. Therefore, this paper focuses on designing a new technique for selecting cloud service in the fuzzy environment by relying on Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS by integrating the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) concepts and the ideal solution (TOPSIS) concepts. The structure of the cloud service selection problem and the weights of the standards are determined by The Fuzzy AHP technique concepts. Fuzzy TOPSIS concepts used to arrange the final solution. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique is clarified by increasing accuracy by almost 15% through implementation and case studies.","","978-1-7281-5276-9","10.1109/ICCTA48790.2019.9478831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478831","Cloud service selection;MCDM;QoS;AHP;TOPSIS;Fuzzy concept","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Analytic hierarchy process;Task analysis;Standards;Service level agreements","analytic hierarchy process;cloud computing;contracts;fuzzy set theory","cloud service provider;service level agreement;fuzzy TOPSIS concepts;MCDM;multicriteria decision making;fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS;fuzzy analytical hierarchy process;cloud computing;service delivery;cloud user requirements;cloud service selection problem","","1","","40","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The importance of language modeling comes from its involvement in many language processing tasks such as conversational system, speech to text, and text summarization. The language models are typically trained to learn the occurrence of next word in a sequence based on previous words in the text. However, when it comes to testing, it is highly expected that the entire sequence will be generated from the scratch which is computationally not suitable to many applications. In this paper, one of the popular deep learning architectures called bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) to develop a text generation approach. The recurrent neural network used in the developed approach uses long short-term memory (LSTM). By using LMST recurrent neural network, the proposed approach is well suited to making predictions based on time series data. Two representations are considered in this paper; word to vector (word2vec) and one-hot representations. The word2vec model is used with two datasets called Twilight and Alice in Wonderland stories while the one-hot model is used only with Alice in Wonderland story only.

Using a wide range of historical anecdotes and real-world examples, Joshua Holden shows how mathematical principles underpin the ways that different codes and ciphers work. He focuses on both code making and code breaking and discusses most of the ancient and modern ciphers that are currently known. He begins by looking at substitution ciphers, and then discusses how to introduce flexibility and additional notation. Holden goes on to explore polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, connections between ciphers and computer encryption, stream ciphers, public-key ciphers, and ciphers involving exponentiation. He concludes by looking at the future of ciphers and where cryptography might be headed. The Mathematics of Secrets reveals the mathematics working stealthily in the science of coded messages.A blog describing new developments and historical discoveries in cryptography related to the material in this book is accessible at http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10826.html.","","9780691184555","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452466.pdf&bkn=9452465&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

"Formal Verification of Control System Software","P. -L. Garoche",NA,"Formal Verification of Control System Software","","2019","","","","","An essential introduction to the analysis and verification of control system softwareThe verification of control system software is critical to a host of technologies and industries, from aeronautics and medical technology to the cars we drive. The failure of controller software can cost people their lives. In this authoritative and accessible book, Pierre-Loïc Garoche provides control engineers and computer scientists with an indispensable introduction to the formal techniques for analyzing and verifying this important class of software.Too often, control engineers are unaware of the issues surrounding the verification of software, while computer scientists tend to be unfamiliar with the specificities of controller software. Garoche provides a unified approach that is geared to graduate students in both fields, covering formal verification methods as well as the design and verification of controllers. He presents a wealth of new verification techniques for performing exhaustive analysis of controller software. These include new means to compute nonlinear invariants, the use of convex optimization tools, and methods for dealing with numerical imprecisions such as floating point computations occurring in the analyzed software.As the autonomy of critical systems continues to increase—as evidenced by autonomous cars, drones, and satellites and landers—the numerical functions in these systems are growing ever more advanced. The techniques presented here are essential to support the formal analysis of the controller software being used in these new and emerging technologies.","","9780691189581","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452602.pdf&bkn=9452601&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Bressoud",NA,"Calculus Reordered: A History of the Big Ideas","","2019","","","","","How our understanding of calculus has evolved over more than three centuries, how this has shaped the way it is taught in the classroom, and why calculus pedagogy needs to changeCalculus Reordered takes readers on a remarkable journey through hundreds of years to tell the story of how calculus evolved into the subject we know today. David Bressoud explains why calculus is credited to seventeenth-century figures Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, and how its current structure is based on developments that arose in the nineteenth century. Bressoud argues that a pedagogy informed by the historical development of calculus represents a sounder way for students to learn this fascinating area of mathematics.Delving into calculus’s birth in the Hellenistic Eastern Mediterranean—particularly in Syracuse, Sicily and Alexandria, Egypt—as well as India and the Islamic Middle East, Bressoud considers how calculus developed in response to essential questions emerging from engineering and astronomy. He looks at how Newton and Leibniz built their work on a flurry of activity that occurred throughout Europe, and how Italian philosophers such as Galileo Galilei played a particularly important role. In describing calculus’s evolution, Bressoud reveals problems with the standard ordering of its curriculum: limits, differentiation, integration, and series. He contends that the historical order—integration as accumulation, then differentiation as ratios of change, series as sequences of partial sums, and finally limits as they arise from the algebra of inequalities—makes more sense in the classroom environment.Exploring the motivations behind calculus’s discovery, Calculus Reordered highlights how this essential tool of mathematics came to be.","","9780691189161","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453320.pdf&bkn=9453319&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Brought together here for the first time, these conjectures describe the structure of étale cohomology and its relation to motivic cohomology and Chow groups.Although the proof relies on the work of several people, it is credited primarily to Vladimir Voevodsky. The authors draw on a multitude of published and unpublished sources to explain the large-scale structure of Voevodsky’s proof and introduce the key figures behind its development. They proceed to describe the highly innovative geometric constructions of Markus Rost, including the construction of norm varieties, which play a crucial role in the proof.

No longer the exemplar of Enlightenment rationality, the legendary physicist suddenly became “the last of the magicians.” Newton the Alchemist unlocks the secrets of Newton’s alchemical quest, providing a radically new understanding of the uncommon genius who probed nature at its deepest levels in pursuit of empirical knowledge.In this evocative and superbly written book, William Newman blends in-depth analysis of newly available texts with laboratory replications of Newton’s actual experiments in alchemy. He does not justify Newton’s alchemical research as part of a religious search for God in the physical world, nor does he argue that Newton studied alchemy to learn about gravitational attraction. Newman traces the evolution of Newton’s alchemical ideas and practices over a span of more than three decades, showing how they proved fruitful in diverse scientific fields. A precise experimenter in the realm of “chymistry,” Newton put the riddles of alchemy to the test in his lab. He also used ideas drawn from the alchemical texts to great effect in his optical experimentation. In his hands, alchemy was a tool for attaining the material benefits associated with the philosopher’s stone and an instrument for acquiring scientific knowledge of the most sophisticated kind.Newton the Alchemist provides rare insights into a man who was neither Enlightenment rationalist nor irrational magus, but rather an alchemist who sought through experiment and empiricism to alter nature at its very heart.","","9780691185033","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453262.pdf&bkn=9453261&pdfType=book","Isaac Newton;nature;alchemy;chymistry;optical experimentation;scientific knowledge;Enlightenment;empiricism;reason;chymical research;secret fire;natural world;chymical studies;experimental philosophy;philosophers' stone;adept;exegesis;biblical prophecy;aurific art;ancient mythology;metals;mining;Eirenaeus Philalethes;Nicolas Flamel;education;Free Grammar School;Trinity College;Treatise of Chymistry;Robert Boyle;Benedictine Basilius Valentinus;optical research;optics;color theory;treatise;Humores minerales;Of Natures obvious laws & processes in vegetation;sea salt;niter;vegetability;Michael Sendivogius;antimony;lead;Philalethes;florilegium;Keynes 35;Johann de Monte–Snyders;alchemist;Johann de Monte-Snyders;Sendivogius;Keynes MS 58;Ramon Lull;Epistola ad Theodorum Mundanum;Opera;Nicolas Fatio de Duillier;experimental notebooks;chymical laboratory;CU Add. 3973;sophic sal ammoniac;antimonial sublimate;copper vitriol;sal ammoniac;our Venus;scientific collaboration;Three Mysterious Fires;Keynes 58;caduceus of Mercury;scythe of Saturn;Praxis;alchemical text;florilegium style;laboratory notebooks;chymist;Captain Hylliard;William Yworth;lorilegia;refraction theory;sulfur;Opticks;Hypothesis of Light;chymistry of light;refractive power;color;phlogiston theory;sophic mercury;gold;alchemists;chrysopoeia","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Scouting and Scoring: How We Know What We Know about Baseball","C. Phillips",NA,"Scouting and Scoring: How We Know What We Know about Baseball","","2019","","","","","An in-depth look at the intersection of judgment and statistics in baseballScouting and scoring are considered fundamentally different ways of ascertaining value in baseball. Scouting seems to rely on experience and intuition, scoring on performance metrics and statistics. In Scouting and Scoring, Christopher Phillips rejects these simplistic divisions. He shows how both scouts and scorers rely on numbers, bureaucracy, trust, and human labor in order to make sound judgments about the value of baseball players.Tracing baseball’s story from the nineteenth century to today, Phillips explains that the sport was one of the earliest and most consequential fields for the introduction of numerical analysis. New technologies and methods of data collection were supposed to enable teams to quantify the drafting and managing of players—replacing scouting with scoring. But that’s not how things turned out. Over the decades, scouting and scoring started looking increasingly similar. Scouts expressed their judgments in highly formulaic ways, using numerical grades and scientific instruments to evaluate players. Scorers drew on moral judgments, depended on human labor to maintain and correct data, and designed bureaucratic systems to make statistics appear reliable. From the invention of official scorers and Statcast to the creation of the Major League Scouting Bureau, the history of baseball reveals the inextricable connections between human expertise and data science.A unique consideration of the role of quantitative measurement and human judgment, Scouting and Scoring provides an entirely fresh understanding of baseball by showing what the sport reveals about reliable knowledge in the modern world.","","9780691188980","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452700.pdf&bkn=9452699&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Together, these 2016 lectures—which were delivered in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the annual summer workshops in Alpbach, Austria—provide an introduction to high-level research on three topics: Shimura varieties, hyperelliptic continued fractions and generalized Jacobians, and Faltings height and L-functions. The book consists of notes, written by young researchers, on three sets of lectures or minicourses given at Alpbach.The first course, taught by Peter Scholze, contains his recent results dealing with the local Langlands conjecture. The fundamental question is whether for a given datum there exists a so-called local Shimura variety. In some cases, they exist in the category of rigid analytic spaces; in others, one has to use Scholze's perfectoid spaces.The second course, taught by Umberto Zannier, addresses the famous Pell equation—not in the classical setting but rather with the so-called polynomial Pell equation, where the integers are replaced by polynomials in one variable with complex coefficients, which leads to the study of hyperelliptic continued fractions and generalized Jacobians.The third course, taught by Shou-Wu Zhang, originates in the Chowla–Selberg formula, which was taken up by Gross and Zagier to relate values of the L-function for elliptic curves with the height of Heegner points on the curves. Zhang, X. Yuan, and Wei Zhang prove the Gross–Zagier formula on Shimura curves and verify the Colmez conjecture on average.","","9780691197548","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452324.pdf&bkn=9452323&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

The result ushered in a new era and made Einstein a global celebrity by confirming his dramatic prediction that the path of light rays would be bent by gravity. Today, Einstein’s theory is scientific fact. Yet the effort to “weigh light” by measuring the gravitational deflection of starlight during the May 29, 1919, solar eclipse has become clouded by myth and skepticism. Could Arthur Eddington and Frank Dyson have gotten the results they claimed? Did the pacifist Eddington falsify evidence to foster peace after a horrific war by validating the theory of a German antiwar campaigner? In No Shadow of a Doubt, Daniel Kennefick provides definitive answers by offering the most comprehensive and authoritative account of how expedition scientists overcame war, bad weather, and equipment problems to make the experiment a triumphant success.The reader follows Eddington on his voyage to Africa through his letters home, and delves with Dyson into how the complex experiment was accomplished, through his notes. Other characters include Howard Grubb, the brilliant Irishman who made the instruments; William Campbell, the American astronomer who confirmed the result; and Erwin Findlay-Freundlich, the German whose attempts to perform the test in Crimea were foiled by clouds and his arrest.By chronicling the expeditions and their enormous impact in greater detail than ever before, No Shadow of a Doubt reveals a story that is even richer and more exciting than previously known.","","9780691190051","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452642.pdf&bkn=9452641&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Nahin",NA,"How to Fall Slower Than Gravity: And Other Everyday (and Not So Everyday) Uses of Mathematics and Physical Reasoning","","2019","","","","","An engaging collection of intriguing problems that shows you how to think like a mathematical physicistPaul Nahin is a master at explaining odd phenomena through straightforward mathematics. In this collection of twenty-six intriguing problems, he explores how mathematical physicists think. Always entertaining, the problems range from ancient catapult conundrums to the puzzling physics of a very peculiar material called NASTYGLASS—and from dodging trucks to why raindrops fall slower than the rate of gravity. The questions raised may seem impossible to answer at first and may require an unexpected twist in reasoning, but sometimes their solutions are surprisingly simple. Nahin’s goal, however, is always to guide readers—who will need only to have studied advanced high school math and physics—in expanding their mathematical thinking to make sense of the curiosities of the physical world.The problems are in the first part of the book and the solutions are in the second, so that readers may challenge themselves to solve the questions on their own before looking at the explanations. The problems show how mathematics—including algebra, trigonometry, geometry, and calculus—can be united with physical laws to solve both real and theoretical problems. Historical anecdotes woven throughout the book bring alive the circumstances and people involved in some amazing discoveries and achievements.More than a puzzle book, this work will immerse you in the delights of scientific history while honing your math skills.","","9780691185026","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452334.pdf&bkn=9452333&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

This book looks at a specific example of a local-to-global principle: Weil’s conjecture on the Tamagawa number of a semisimple algebraic group G over K. In the case where K is the function field of an algebraic curve X, this conjecture counts the number of G-bundles on X (global information) in terms of the reduction of G at the points of X (local information). The goal of this book is to give a conceptual proof of Weil’s conjecture, based on the geometry of the moduli stack of G-bundles. Inspired by ideas from algebraic topology, it introduces a theory of factorization homology in the setting ℓ-adic sheaves. Using this theory, Dennis Gaitsgory and Jacob Lurie articulate a different local-to-global principle: a product formula that expresses the cohomology of the moduli stack of G-bundles (a global object) as a tensor product of local factors.Using a version of the Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula, Gaitsgory and Lurie show that this product formula implies Weil’s conjecture. The proof of the product formula will appear in a sequel volume.","","9780691184432","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452476.pdf&bkn=9452475&pdfType=book","number theory;Weil's conjecture;G-bundles;algebraic topology;factorization homology;local-to-global principle;cohomology;function fields;rational functions;continuous Künneth decomposition;triangulated category;sheaves;infinity;Weill's conjecture;algebraic geometry;affine group;analogue;Frobenius automorphism;trace formula;Grothendieck–Lefschetz;global quotient stacks;moduli stack","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

While it originated in economics, this theory now has applications in areas as diverse as mathematical finance, crowd phenomena, epidemiology, and cybersecurity.Because mean field games concern the interactions of infinitely many players in an optimal control framework, one expects them to appear as the limit for Nash equilibria of differential games with finitely many players as the number of players tends to infinity. This book rigorously establishes this convergence, which has been an open problem until now. The limit of the system associated with differential games with finitely many players is described by the so-called master equation, a nonlocal transport equation in the space of measures. After defining a suitable notion of differentiability in the space of measures, the authors provide a complete self-contained analysis of the master equation. Their analysis includes the case of common noise problems in which all the players are affected by a common Brownian motion. They then go on to explain how to use the master equation to prove the mean field limit.This groundbreaking book presents two important new results in mean field games that contribute to a unified theoretical framework for this exciting and fast-developing area of mathematics.","","9780691193717","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452506.pdf&bkn=9452505&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

While the rules governing dynamical systems are well-specified and simple, the behavior of many dynamical systems is remarkably complex. Of particular note, simple deterministic dynamical systems produce output that appears random and for which long-term prediction is impossible. Using little math beyond basic algebra, David Feldman gives readers a grounded, concrete, and concise overview.In initial chapters, Feldman introduces iterated functions and differential equations. He then surveys the key concepts and results to emerge from dynamical systems: chaos and the butterfly effect, deterministic randomness, bifurcations, universality, phase space, and strange attractors. Throughout, Feldman examines possible scientific implications of these phenomena for the study of complex systems, highlighting the relationships between simplicity and complexity, order and disorder.Filling the gap between popular accounts of dynamical systems and chaos and textbooks aimed at physicists and mathematicians, Chaos and Dynamical Systems will be highly useful not only to students at the undergraduate and advanced levels, but also to researchers in the natural, social, and biological sciences.","","9780691189390","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453370.pdf&bkn=9453369&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

First posed by the ancient Greeks, these compass and straightedge problems—squaring the circle, trisecting an angle, doubling the cube, and inscribing regular polygons in a circle—have served as ever-present muses for mathematicians for more than two millennia. David Richeson follows the trail of these problems to show that ultimately their proofs—which demonstrated the impossibility of solving them using only a compass and straightedge—depended on and resulted in the growth of mathematics.Richeson investigates how celebrated luminaries, including Euclid, Archimedes, Viète, Descartes, Newton, and Gauss, labored to understand these problems and how many major mathematical discoveries were related to their explorations. Although the problems were based in geometry, their resolutions were not, and had to wait until the nineteenth century, when mathematicians had developed the theory of real and complex numbers, analytic geometry, algebra, and calculus. Pierre Wantzel, a little-known mathematician, and Ferdinand von Lindemann, through his work on pi, finally determined the problems were impossible to solve. Along the way, Richeson provides entertaining anecdotes connected to the problems, such as how the Indiana state legislature passed a bill setting an incorrect value for pi and how Leonardo da Vinci made elegant contributions in his own study of these problems.Taking readers from the classical period to the present, Tales of Impossibility chronicles how four unsolvable problems have captivated mathematical thinking for centuries.","","9780691194233","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453390.pdf&bkn=9453389&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

As Michael Gordin reveals, Mendeleev was not only a luminary in the history of science, he was also an astonishingly wide-ranging political and cultural figure. From his attack on Spiritualism to his failed voyage to the Arctic and his near-mythical hot-air balloon trip, this is the story of an extraordinary maverick. The ideals that shaped his work outside science also led Mendeleev to order the elements and, eventually, to engineer one of the most fascinating scientific developments of the nineteenth century.  A Well-Ordered Thing is a classic work that tells the story of one of the world’s most important minds.","","9780691184425","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452656.pdf&bkn=9452655&pdfType=book","Dmitrii Mendeleev;periodic table;history of science;maverick;autocracy;Russian chauvinism;liberalism;rule of law;Russian stability;Russia;periodic system;chemistry;periodic law;St. Petersburg University;classification;gas laws;physics;Spiritualism;seances;Great Reforms;religion;superstition;Russian Spiritualism;Mediumistic Phenomena;Russian Physical Society;Russian Chemical Society;Academy of Sciences;technology;St. Petersburg;scientific societies;cultural conflict;Imperial Russia;bureaucracy;Imperial Academy of Sciences;Russian education;educational reform;Russian culture;general examinations;individual innovation;teaching;Imperial systems;student rebellion;tsarist regime;Imperial Petersburg;European science;universality","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

G. Jung delivered a series of public lectures at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. Intended for a general audience, these lectures addressed a broad range of topics, from dream analysis to yoga and meditation. Here for the first time in English are Jung’s lectures on the history of modern psychology from the Enlightenment to his own time, delivered in the fall and winter of 1933–34.In these inaugural lectures, Jung emphasizes the development of concepts of the unconscious and offers a comparative study of movements in French, German, British, and American thought. He also gives detailed analyses of Justinus Kerner’s The Seeress of Prevorst and Théodore Flournoy’s From India to the Planet Mars. These lectures present the history of psychology from the perspective of one of the field’s most legendary figures. They provide a unique opportunity to encounter Jung speaking for specialists and nonspecialists alike and are the primary source for understanding his late work.Featuring cross-references to the Jung canon and explanations of concepts and terminology, History of Modern Psychology painstakingly reconstructs and translates these lectures from manuscripts, summaries, and recently recovered shorthand notes of attendees. It is the first volume of a series that will make the ETH lectures available in their entirety to English readers.","","9780691184098","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452322.pdf&bkn=9452321&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

In fact, it is only the best-known recent experiment in a long line of similar efforts going back to the 1970s. But the story behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and its blockchain technology has largely been untold—until now. In Digital Cash, Finn Brunton reveals how technological utopians and political radicals created experimental money to bring about their visions of the future: protecting privacy or bringing down governments, preparing for apocalypse or launching a civilization of innovation and abundance that would make its creators immortal.The incredible story of the pioneers of cryptocurrency takes us from autonomous zones on the high seas to the world’s most valuable dump, from bank runs to idea coupons, from time travelers in a San Francisco bar to the pattern securing every twenty-dollar bill, and from marketplaces for dangerous secrets to a tank of frozen heads awaiting revival in the far future. Along the way, Digital Cash explores the hard questions and challenges that these innovators faced: How do we learn to trust and use different kinds of money? What makes digital objects valuable? How does currency prove itself as real to us? What would it take to make a digital equivalent to cash, something that could be created but not forged, exchanged but not copied, and which reveals nothing about its users?Filled with marvelous characters, stories, and ideas, Digital Cash is an engaging and accessible account of the strange origins and remarkable technologies behind today’s cryptocurrency explosion.","","9780691185668","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452386.pdf&bkn=9452385&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Therefore, patterns of holes on the parasitic element are optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) under constraint that the directivity at an interested direction of the antenna will be increased and the proposed antenna still operates at the original frequency (2.45 GHz). The results show the directivity of the proposed antenna is increased from 6.50 to 6.88 and S11 is still lower than -10 dB at 2.45 GHz.

In this paper, we study a technique of side lobe level suppression in a THz bowtie antenna design on an extended hemispherical dielectric lens. Two methods are applied and reviewed in this research to reduce sidelobe level, i.e., antenna cross design to provide quasi-isotropic radiation pattern and optimum matching layers to collimate radiated waves from the substrate to free space. CST Microwave studio is used to simulate the model. The optimum side lobe level obtained from five optimum matching layers can be at -12.1 dB and -11.9 dB for E-plane and H-plane, respectively.

Therefore, several transceiver performance metrics need to be measured OTA in far-field conditions, including Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), Adjacent Channel Leakage Power (ACLR), and Spectral Emissions Mask (SEM). Due to the basestation size in the 5G sub 6 GHz frequency bands, this requires a far-field chamber with 10 to 50 meters of range length. This paper describes a new measurement concept in compact test chambers using the first commercially available Plane Wave Converter (PWC): The R&S PWC200 is a phased antenna array of 156 elements located in the near-field of the DUT. It uses a variant of a hardware based Fourier transform to create far-field conditions, a quiet zone of a plane wave of e.g. 1m diameter at a distance of 1.5 meters. The measurement system is bidirectional and able to directly measure both traditional antenna metrics of gain as well as transceiver metrics of EVM, ACLR, SEM, and receiver sensitivity.

In SLPPNet, LPP-like algorithm is applied to extract features, which can maintain the spatial structure of high-dimensional data. Moreover, we changed the structure of the PCANet to obtain the filter kernels. The PCANet needs to use all training images to calculate a multistage filter bank, while the SLPPNet only needs to use one training image. Hence, the SLPPNet can greatly reduce the amount of calculation. We tested the SLPPNet extensively on various databases, such as Yale, ORL, AR and Extended Yale B datasets, and compared it with the PCANet.

However, the antenna dimensions are usually large and unsuited for installation, for example, on vehicles, aircrafts, ships and modern buildings. The proposed antenna dimension is significantly reduced by using the sectoral spherical dielectric lens together with a virtual source (image source) technique.

Since most of such adulterations are made by illiterate people who are unaware of hazardous health effects associated with such contaminations, consuming such impure food can result in various dangerous health effects. Though government regulatory authorities have detection mechanisms, they are not only expensive (with general spectroscopic analysis) but also inaccessible for domestic users for daily usage. Owing to such situation, there is a definite need for a portable and straightforward detection mechanism for domestic users to avoid serious health issues. In this paper, we present all-dielectric meta-biosensors to identify (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the hazardous adulterants in water and milk via refractive index sensing. Our demonstrated platform is a highly efficient and unique way of testing water and milk with numerically calculated sensitivity of ~ 500nm/RIU, a change in response of transmittance per refractive index unit is ~ 8 (800 %) and a figure of merit (FoM) of ~ 14.7.

In particular, the importance of automatic topology generation is illustrated. When the requirement of capacity is more than 20 bits, designing the topology of the tag by performing iterative full-wave simulations is inefficient. As millions of objects need to be mapped with a unique tag topology, a non-iterative design technique without conducting full-wave simulations is important. In this study, the technique of automatic topology generation is developed for the construction of 21-bit chipless RFID tags. The encoding scheme is frequency shift encoding. A tag is comprised of 7 half-wave slots, serving as electromagnetic resonators. The non-iterative design methodology is enabled by reducing the number of design variables to only one, which is the length of the slot. We simulate the resonant frequencies for different lengths of the slot, fitting the simulated results using an exponential function. This response surface model shows excellent prediction capability, thereby leading to the synthesis of the resonant frequency without performing additional simulations. The proposed method is examined for 30 samples in the 21-bit chipless RFID. All the tags exhibit correct radar cross-section (RCS) spectrum; thus, the information of the tags can be successfully retrieved.","2642-9179","978-1-6654-0054-1","10.1109/APCAP47827.2019.9472123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9472123","Backscattering;design methodology;radar cross-section;radiofrequency identification;resonators","Radar cross-sections;Fitting;Resonant frequency;Predictive models;Reliability engineering;Encoding;Topology","iterative methods;radar cross-sections;radiofrequency identification;resonators;topology","frequency-coded chipless RFID;chipless radiofrequency identification;automatic topology generation;iterative full-wave simulations;unique tag topology;noniterative design technique;encoding scheme;frequency shift;electromagnetic resonators;noniterative design methodology;word length 20.0 bit","","","","6","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The bent length at each end of the dipole started at one segment and incremented by one segment - allowing for 12 total test runs. For each bent length, a 5-degree increment (from 0 to 90 degrees) of the bend angle was set. Two transmission line impedance were chosen: 50 Ω and 75 Ω. The results showed that the average SWR bandwidth at different bend angles for a 50-Ω transmission line impedance tend to increase up to a bent length of 5 segments and the average SWR bandwidth at different bend angles for a 75-Ω transmission line impedance tend to decrease up to a bent length of 6 segments.","2642-9179","978-1-6654-0054-1","10.1109/APCAP47827.2019.9471911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9471911","SWR;bandwidth;dipole;bent;EZNEC","Power transmission lines;Dipole antennas;Wires;Resonant frequency;Bandwidth;Impedance;Transmission line antennas","antenna radiation patterns;dipole antennas;wire antennas","bent resonant dipole;bent length;resonant wire dipole antenna;resonant length;bend angle;average SWR bandwidth;different bend angles;transmission line impedance;frequency 299.792458 Hz;size 6.35 mm","","","","4","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through numerical simulations based on the finite-difference-time-domain method, this feature is promising to be employed in future possible applications.

In the present simulations, RRS examples with Gaussian type of spectrum are generated by the numerical convolution between the Gaussian type of spectral function and random impulses. Optical rays along RRS are computed by a new type of ray-tracing method where the shortest paths are first computed based on the Dijkstra's algorithm (DA) and then path modifications, that is, path-linearization, path-section and LOS-check, are carried out to construct optical rays.

The GBAS is also used for precise approach and landing of aircraft. The antenna used for transmission and reception exhibits the quadrangular array structure of a dipole antenna having linear polarization with VHF data broadcast (VDB). However, in the case of a VDB antenna, signal cancellation and interference among individual elements may occur. In this paper, we describe an omni-directional microstrip antenna that can replace the VDB antenna used in GBAS. The proposed design reduces the ground plane in a λ/4 folded microstrip antenna in order to have omni-directional characteristics and to radiate without affecting the ground plane itself. To miniaturize the physical size of the antenna, a metal plate is added between the openings using a perturbing effect. The designed antenna is verified through simulation. The size of the radiating element is 318 mm (0.12λ) × 100 mm (0.038λ) × 221 mm (0.083λ), whereas the size of the radiating element of a λ/4 folded microstrip antenna is 568 mm (0.214λ) × 100 mm (0.038λ) × 608 mm (0.23λ). Thus, the size of the radiating element is reduced by 79.7%.

This paper proposes a novel method to compress vectors of high precision weights of DNNs to ternary vectors, namely a cosine similarity based target non-retraining ternary (TNT) compression method. Our method leverages cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distances as commonly used in the literature and succeeds in reducing the size of the search space to find optimal ternary vectors from $3^{N}$ to $N$, where $N$ is the dimension of target vectors. As a result, the computational complexity for TNT to find theoretically optimal ternary vectors is only $O(N\log(N))$. Moreover, our experiments show that, when we ternarize models of DNN with high precision parameters, the obtained quantized models can exhibit sufficiently high accuracy so that re-training models is not necessary.","","978-1-6654-2418-9","10.1109/EMC2-NIPS53020.2019.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463521","Cosine similarity;Neural network compression;Ternary weights;Non-retrainingtable*","Couplings;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Conferences;Neural networks;Machine learning;Energy efficiency","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;vectors","target vectors;computational complexity;theoretically optimal ternary vectors;high precision parameters;quantized models;sufficiently high accuracy;target nonretraining ternary compression method;cosine similarity;multiply-accumulate operations;high precision weights;computation involving millions;sufficient resources;edge devices;DNN;deep neural networks;TNT;none-retraining ternary;neural networks weights quantization","","","","8","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The network configurations utilize the multiplication-free operator for more than 85% operations from the total. The selected configurations are 98.6% accurate for MNIST, 90.2% for CIFAR10, and 66.9% for CIFAR100.

The majority of existing work focuses on accelerating image classification, while other fundamental vision problems, including object detection and instance segmentation, have not been adequately addressed. Compared with image classification, detection problems are more sensitive to the spatial variance of objects, and therefore, require specialized convolutions to aggregate spatial information. To address this, recent work proposes dynamic deformable convolution to augment regular convolutions. Regular convolutions process a fixed grid of pixels across all the spatial locations in an image, while dynamic deformable convolutions may access arbitrary pixels. The access pattern of deformable convolutions is input-dependent and varies per spatial location. These properties lead to inefficient memory accesses of inputs with existing hardware. In this work, we first investigate the overhead of the deformable convolution on embedded FPGA SoCs, and then show the accuracy-latency tradeoffs for a set of algorithm modifications, including full versus depthwise, fixed-shape, and limited-range. These modifications benefit the efficiency of the embedded accelerator in general. We build an efficient object detection network with modified deformable convolutions and quantize the network using state-of-the-art quantization methods. Experiments show that our co-design optimization for the deformable convolution achieves significant hardware speedup with little accuracy compromised.","","978-1-6654-2418-9","10.1109/EMC2-NIPS53020.2019.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463578","accelerators;computer vision;object detection;codesign","Quantization (signal);Object detection;Machine learning;Hardware;Energy efficiency;Real-time systems;Object recognition","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;image classification;object detection;quantisation (signal);system-on-chip","object detection;modified deformable convolutions;algorithm-hardware co-design;image classification;instance segmentation;specialized convolutions;computer vision;FPGA;embedded FPGA SoC;dynamic deformable convolution;spatial location","","2","","8","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several previous works attempted to directly approximate a pre-trained model by low-rank decomposition; however, small approximation errors in parameters can ripple over a large prediction loss. Apparently, it is not optimal to separate low-rank approximation from training. Unlike previous works, this paper integrates low rank approximation and regularization into the training process. We propose Trained Rank Pruning (TRP), which alternates between low rank approximation and training. TRP maintains the capacity of the original network while imposing low-rank constraints during training. A nuclear regularization optimized by stochastic sub-gradient descent is utilized to further promote low rank in TRP. Networks trained with TRP has a low-rank structure in nature, and is approximated with negligible performance loss, thus eliminating fine-tuning after low rank approximation. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, outperforming previous compression counterparts using low rank approximation.

Due to the in-situ computation capability, analog ReRAM crossbars yield significant throughput improvement and energy reduction compared to traditional digital methods. However, the power hungry analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) prevent the practical deployment of ReRAM-based DNN accelerators on end devices with limited chip area and power budget. We observe that due to the limited bit-density of ReRAM cells, DNN weights are bit sliced and correspondingly stored on multiple ReRAM bitlines. The accumulated current on bitlines resulted by weights directly dictates the overhead of ADCs. As such, bitwise weight sparsity rather than the sparsity of the full weight, is desirable for efficient ReRAM deployment. In this work, we propose bit-slice $\ell_{1}$, the first algorithm to induce bit-slice sparsity during the training of dynamic fixed-point DNNs. Experiment results show that our approach achieves 2× sparsity improvement compared to previous algorithms. The resulting sparsity allows the ADC resolution to be reduced to 1-bit of the most significant bit-slice and down to 3-bit for the others bits, which significantly speeds up processing and reduces power and area overhead.","","978-1-6654-2418-9","10.1109/EMC2-NIPS53020.2019.00008","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1822085,CSR-1717885); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463560","","Training;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Neural networks;Machine learning;Throughput;Energy efficiency","AI chips;analogue-digital conversion;deep learning (artificial intelligence);fixed point arithmetic;logic design;low-power electronics;optimisation;resistive RAM","deep neural networks;efficient ReRAM-based deployment;resistive random-access memory;energy reduction;power budget;multiple ReRAM bitlines;ADC resolution;bit-slice sparsity;ReRAM crossbars;limited chip area;limited bit-density;bit-slice ℓ1;dynamic fixed-point DNN","","3","","17","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The precision, sparsity, and complexity are easily configurable by the amount of sampling performed. Our approach, called Monte Carlo Quantization (MCQ), is linear in both time and space, with the resulting quantized, sparse networks showing minimal accuracy loss when compared to the original full-precision networks. Our method either outperforms or achieves competitive results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet when compared to previous methods that do require additional training.","","978-1-6654-2418-9","10.1109/EMC2-NIPS53020.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463561","Compression algorithms;Deep learning;Neural networks","Training;Monte Carlo methods;Quantization (signal);Power demand;Machine learning algorithms;Image coding;Conferences","image sampling;importance sampling;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;quantisation (signal)","sparse networks;full-precision networks;Monte Carlo methods;pre-trained neural networks;importance sampling;low bit-width integer values;full-precision weights;instant quantization;CIFAR-10;ImageNet;lower power consumption","","1","","16","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low-precision networks offer promise as energy and area scale down quadratically with precision. We demonstrate 8- and 4-bit networks that meet or exceed the accuracy of their full-precision versions on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We hypothesize that gradient noise due to quantization during training increases with reduced precision, and seek ways to overcome this. The number of iterations required by SGD to achieve a given training error is related to the square of (a) the distance of the initial solution from the final and (b) the maximum variance of the gradient estimates. Accordingly, we reduce solution distance by starting with pretrained fp32 baseline networks, and combat noise introduced by quantizing weights and activations during training by training longer and reducing learning rates. Sensitivity analysis indicates that these techniques, coupled with activation function range calibration, are sufficient to discover low-precision networks close to fp32 precision baseline networks. Our results provide evidence that 4-bits suffice for classification.","","978-1-6654-2418-9","10.1109/EMC2-NIPS53020.2019.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463517","low precision;deep learning;computer vision","Training;Quantization (signal);Sensitivity analysis;Conferences;Machine learning;Benchmark testing;Energy efficiency","learning (artificial intelligence);sensitivity analysis;ubiquitous computing","low-precision networks;full-precision networks;ubiquitous embedded deep network inference;4-bit networks;full-precision versions;reduced precision;training error;pretrained fp32 baseline networks;fp32 precision baseline networks","","3","","17","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite these successes, one of the biggest challenges to widespread deployment of such object detection networks on edge and mobile scenarios is the high computational and memory requirements. As such, there has been growing research interest in the design of efficient deep neural network architectures catered for edge and mobile usage. In this study, we introduce YOLO Nano, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for the task of object detection. A human-machine collaborative design strategy is leveraged to create YOLO Nano, where principled network design prototyping, based on design principles from the YOLO family of single-shot object detection network architectures, is coupled with machine-driven design exploration to create a compact network with highly customized module-level macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs tailored for the task of embedded object detection. The proposed YOLO Nano possesses a model size of ~4.0MB (>15.1× and >8.3× smaller than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) and requires 4.57B operations for inference (>34% and ~17% lower than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively) while still achieving an mAP of ~69.1% on the VOC 2007 dataset (~12% and ~10.7% higher than Tiny YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLOv3, respectively). Experiments on inference speed and power efficiency on a Jetson AGX Xavier embedded module at different power budgets further demonstrate the efficacy of YOLO Nano for embedded scenarios.","","978-1-6654-2418-9","10.1109/EMC2-NIPS53020.2019.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463524","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Microarchitecture;Image edge detection;Neural networks;Memory management;Object detection;Machine learning;Network architecture","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;object detection","high computational memory requirements;efficient deep neural network architectures;YOLO Nano;highly compact deep convolutional neural network;object detection networks;deep convolutional neural networks;Tiny YOLOv3;Tiny YOLOv2;embedded object detection;microarchitecture designs;highly customized module-level macroarchitecture;machine-driven design exploration;single-shot object detection network architectures;design principles;principled network design prototyping;human-machine collaborative design strategy","","33","","23","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking it is a substantial burden on you and the people who help care for you, particularly if you are elderly or suffering from cognitive impairment. What if the treatment could be released automatically, not on a predefined routine but by detecting when you actually need it? This is a powerful vision, but one which highlights the limitations of current technologies. Over the last decade exciting non-invasive sensing platforms such as the fitbit and Apple watch have enabled the capture of real-time health and lifestyle data. However, all current ‘wearables’ have two major limitations: • The manufacturing is based upon highly miniaturised, but essentially conventional, microelectronics mass produced in a Silicon foundry. As such there is limited scope for the personalisation of devices from a manufacturing point of view. It also means that current devices are held in place using straps, which do not maintain a good connection to the body over long periods and which introduce significant numbers of strap and motion artefacts into the collected signals. • Their focus has been on “Big Data” collection. Wearable sensors are now seen as “one-way streets” only for data generation. There is substantial potential for sensor systems which analyse the collected data ‘on-electrode’ and allow data driven personalisation of outputs. For example, monitoring physiological parameters and performing highly targeted treatment release within a few milliseconds of a trigger event, where there is not time to send the signals to a data centre for conventional analysis.","","9788770221313","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450176.pdf&bkn=9431973&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This has been specifically beneficial for the application areas of DNA based diagnostics and full genome sequencing, where the implementation of chemical sensors known as Ion-Sensitive Field Effect Transistors (ISFETs) directly in CMOS has enabled the design of large-scale arrays of millions of sensors that can conduct in-parallel detection of DNA. Furthermore, the scaling of CMOS with Moore's law and the integration capability with microfluidics has enabled commercial efforts to make DNA detection affordable and therefore deployable in hospitals and research labs.","","9788770221313","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450136.pdf&bkn=9431973&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The miniaturised and implantable neural interfacing devices are widely applied in different clinical scenarios for example, peripheral, and spinal nerve interfaces for monitoring epilepsy, cochlear and retinal implants, and as deep brain stimulators thanks to evolutions in microelectronics, sensors, communications, and neuroscience. Implementation of such neuranics (neural electronics) using traditional CMOS technology is inefficient in terms of size, performance and power.

De Jager",NA; NA,"Circuits and Systems for Wearable Technologies","","2019","","","141","150","Energy harvesting (EH) IoT systems are inherently accompanied by challenges in matching the dynamics of the power source with those of the power consumption. To mitigate this, systems typically incorporate large energy storage elements (referred to as ‘energy-neutral’ computing), increasing their volume, mass and cost. However, for future IoT systems that are highly constrained, it is instead desirable to minimize or even remove energy storage. In this presentation, I will discuss the emerging class of ‘energy-driven’ systems which reduce the energy storage by including the EH source and its availability as a primary consideration in the system's design. I will conclude my talk by exploring some open challenges necessitating further research to deliver on this vision of energy-driven IoT systems.","","9788770221313","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450087.pdf&bkn=9431973&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In this paper, we try to examine whether polls and OPOs reveal vote preferences. Taking the 2016 US presidential election as an example, we adopt the dynamic linear models to trace two candidates' popular votes by fusing measurements from social media, news, prediction market, and polls. The interesting findings we obtained are as follows. First, with the estimations of basic dynamic linear model, we find that both the polls and OPOs are subject to measurement bias. Second, to characterize the bias, we add a time-varying parameter into the basic dynamic linear model. Via Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) estimations, we find that although polls and news failed to reflect the victory of Donald Trump, they did reflect candidates' popularity nationwide. Compared with polls and news, OPOs have larger deviations in revealing candidates' national popularity, but they are closer to the electoral vote outcome. Third, we find that there are patterns in the same type of measurement bias, no matter in direction or magnitude. The above three findings highlight the necessity of fusion method using multi-source heterogeneous data to make election forecasts. The fusion is expected to cancel out different types of measurement bias. The findings also indicate that both the polls and OPOs reveal the public opinions although the measurement bias exists. It is useful to adjust measurements extracted from polls and OPOs for specific forecast models.","","978-1-7281-0030-2","10.1109/Cybconf47073.2019.9436606","Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0108400,2020AAA0108405); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9436606","Social Media;Polls;Measurement Bias;Dynamic Linear Model","Monte Carlo methods;Social networking (online);Voting;Conferences;Estimation;Predictive models;Markov processes","forecasting theory;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;politics","polls;election forecasts;candidates;basic dynamic linear model;measurement bias;online public opinions;vote preferences;AD 2016;US presidential election;time-varying parameter;Markov chain Monte Carlo estimations;electoral vote outcome","","","","18","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Faced with such a problem, this paper proposes a non-parametric High-Dimensional test method based on Marginal Sign. After transformation, it can be expressed as the sum of the sign test statistics of each dimension, causing it easier to infer the progressive distribution of the test statistics when the dimension approaches infinity. After giving the test statistic, we conduct the numerical experiment in this paper to try to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the new method with the existing methods.

DEA can compare efficiencies of units in a system; moreover, an LMDI can express the corresponding contributions between inputs and outputs and avoid the hypersensitivity of the inputs and outputs selection process in DEA. The variables of CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and economic components of China from 1990 to 2016 were transformed into various factors for this efficiency evaluation. The results from the integrated approach between LMDI and DEA performed better fitted than the ordinary DEA. It seems likely that this approach can produce better correlation between the input and output variables, and also it can return less variance in the models. These possibly help to reduce a gap in the hypersensitivity issue.","","978-1-7281-0030-2","10.1109/Cybconf47073.2019.9436628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9436628","decomposition analysis;LMDI;data envelopment analysis;DEA;environmental economic efficiency","Productivity;Energy consumption;Biological system modeling;Sociology;Government;Employment;Energy measurement","air pollution control;carbon compounds;data envelopment analysis;energy consumption;environmental economics;sensitivity analysis","data envelopment analysis;LMDI;energy consumption;economic components;hypersensitivity issue;China's environmental economic efficiency;environmental issues;global CO2 emissions;extended Kaya identity;logarithmic-mean Divisia index;DEA;inputs-outputs selection process;CO2","","","","33","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From 1994, French government stipulates that a certain proportion of music in French, at least 40 percent, should play on radio stations. The regulation was introduced as part of efforts to protect and promote cultural diversity. Radio stations argued that the regulation imposed a constraint upon the programming decision and forced them to branch out and play less well-aired content. The regulation has an effect on the local ratio broadcasting, giving rise to changes affecting stations' programming decisions. I compute a measure of product similarity index called cosine similarity, which allow me to estimate program differentiation in a multi-characteristics space. The results suggest that stations complying with the regulation are more likely to broadcast similar program contents than noncomplying stations.","","978-1-7281-0030-2","10.1109/Cybconf47073.2019.9436602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9436602","Broadcasting competition;Quota;Regulation;Programming similarity","Conferences;Government;Programming;Extraterrestrial measurements;Regulation;Cultural differences;Radio broadcasting","gender issues;radio broadcasting;radio stations;technology management","radio stations;French government;programming decision;local ratio broadcasting;product similarity index;program differentiation;similar program contents;noncomplying stations;radio broadcasting;product differentiation;efficiency 40.0 percent","","","","15","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Apart from existing stochastic demand, there is efficacious demand stimulated by shopping guide investment in the market. This stimulating demand mainly depends on sale price and stochastic expected value of consumers. We consider effect of sale price and capital constraint on supply chain operational decision, like order decision and shopping guide investment strategy, etc. In our model, sale price has income effect and demand effect conversely on retailer's decision. When sale price is in a low level, income effect is dominant, making retailer improve inventory and shopping guide investment dramatically. On high sale price condition, demand effect is obvious, making order quantity keep robust and leading to decreasing of shopping guide investment. Besides, sale price has positive impact on wholesale price and can improve profit of retailer and manufacturer. We consider in influences of initial capital. With increase of initial capital, order quantity decreases and investment of shopping guide increases. This is risk shifting mechanism for manufacturer to improve wholesale price for response to retailer's bankruptcy risk. We find there exists shopping guide benefits to supply chain when retailer is extremely capital constraint.

Numerous methods have been proposed for credit card fraud detection during past decades. However, most of the existing frameworks mainly focus on directly processing structured data. While they lack inner relations between features of raw descriptions for credit owners, this could lead to information deficiency. Therefore, we proposed a graph-based semi-supervised fraud detection framework. In this work, the structured dataset is translated to graph format through the sample similarity in order to improve the effect of label propagation on the graph. We further adopt the GraphSAGE algorithm which has been demonstrated to show excellent performance on node classification tasks. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our graph-based model can outperform state-of-the-art baselines. We argue that our model could be extended to other classification tasks using structured data.","","978-1-7281-0030-2","10.1109/Cybconf47073.2019.9436573","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71621002,71602184,71472175); Ministry of Health of China(grant numbers:2017YFC1200302,2017ZX10303401-002); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0108401,2019QY(Y)0101,2016QY02D0305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9436573","Credit card fraud Detection;Graph neural network;graph modeling;node classification","Conferences;Credit cards;Data models;Classification algorithms;Task analysis;Cybernetics","credit transactions;fraud;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","credit cards;credit card fraud detection;structured data;credit owners;graph-based semisupervised fraud detection framework;graph-based model;credit card payment;commonly used consumption methods;fraud transactions","","","","17","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An Efficient Battery Lifetime Aware Power Saving Scheme was proposed to minimize frequent transition of MS to listening-wake mode in order-to reduce power consumption. However, it increases average response delay due to a longer sleep interval used. Thus, an efficient sleep window based power saving scheme (ESPSS) is proposed to reduce the response delay. The ESPSS introduces an average based sleep window to minimize the longer sleep interval. The scheme also proposed a modified minimum and maximum sleep interval to reduce the response delay. The ESPSS was evaluated using a discrete event simulator.

Dual-mode flash (the medium can be partially switched to SLC mode by programming only 1 bit in some cells) can combine SLC and MLC to provide trading density opportunity for performance. In this paper, we present Hercules—a hybrid storage system that couples dual-mode flash memory and hard drive disk (HDD)—based on the content locality principle for high storage performance. The data are divided into two types: the reference data for read operation and the delta data for write operation. The reference data are stored in SLC and the delta data in MLC or HDD in sequential orders. Hercules organizes the metadata for the mapping of the physical locations of the reference blocks and the delta data of the original blocks, intelligently identifies hot/cold data and performs the data migration between MLC and disk for performance improvements. To validate our findings, we implemented Hercules and made evaluation to show that Hercules can effectively improve the data access speed and reduce the response time, compared with the Flashcache storage structure, and in particular, with Hercules, we can achieve 10% performance improvement over the system in absence of hot delta data caching.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433167","double-mode flash memory;content locality;cache;hybrid storage","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The density of data in construction projects and the inability of extracting these data cause various losses in field studies. In this respect, the behaviors of leaders are important in the selection and efficient use of these data.

This work built a deep learning model and analysed the influence of content, sentiment and user features on information spread. The model used the learning capability of a long short-term memory network to predict ‘retweetability’. Experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets (Hirak and Brexit) collected from Twitter. User features were found to be a key element in the diffusion of information.

In order to improve the optimization performance of the CS algorithm, a new CS extension with multi-swarms and Q-Learning namely MP-QL-CS is proposed. The step size strategy of the CS algorithm is that an individual fitness value is examined based on a one-step evolution effect of an individual instead of evaluating the step size from the multi-step evolution effect. In the MP-QL-CS algorithm, a step size control strategy is considered as action, which is used to examine the individual multi-stepping evolution effect and learn the individual optimal step size by calculating the Q function value. In this way, the MP-QL-CS algorithm can increase the adaptability of individual evolution, and a good balance between diversity and intensification can be achieved. Comparing the MP-QL-CS algorithm with various CS algorithms, variants of differential evolution (DE) and improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, the results demonstrate that the MP-QL-CS algorithm is a competitive swarm algorithm.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433160","cuckoo search algorithm;Q-Learning;multi-stepping evolution;global optimization;multi-swarms","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Nowadays, the scale of graphs becomes so large that traditional algorithms for shortest path are not available to answer the exact distance query quickly. Many methods based on two-hop labeling have been proposed to solve this problem. However, they cost too much either in preprocessing or query phase to handle large networks containing as many as tens of millions of vertices. In this paper, we propose a novel $k$-hub labeling method to address this problem in large networks with less preprocessing cost while keeping the query time in the microsecond level on average. Technically, two types of labels are presented in our construction, one for distance queries when the actual distance is at most $k-2$, which we call local label, and the other for further distance queries, which we call hub label. Our approach of $k$-hub labeling is essentially different from previous widely used two-hop labeling framework since we construct labels by using hub network structure. We conduct extensive experiments on large real-world networks and the results demonstrate the higher efficiency of our method in preprocessing phase and the much smaller space size of constructed index compared to previous efficient two-hop labeling method, with a comparatively fast query speed.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433159","k-hub labeling;exact distance query;large networks","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To capture topological and temporal features, we develope a second-order weighted random walk sampling algorithm. It combines network snapshots with both first-order and second-order weights into one weighted graph. Moreover, it incorporates a damping factor to assign greater weights to more recent snapshots. Next, we adopt graph wavelet neural networks to embed the vertices and use gated recurrent units for predicting new links.

In this paper, we propose a new heuristic algorithm for the crossing resolution maximization problem and we experimentally compare it against the known approaches from the literature.

It is extensively believed that real-world networks, especially social networks, are fast mixing with their mixing time at most $O(\log N)$ where $N$ is the number of vertices. However, the behavior of mixing time in the real-life networks has not been examined carefully, and exactly analytical research for mixing time in models mimicking real networks is still lacking. In this paper, we first experimentally evaluate the mixing time of various real-world networks with scale-free small-world properties and show that their mixing time is much higher than anticipated. To better understand the behavior of the mixing time for real-world networks, we then analytically study the mixing time of the Apollonian network, which is simultaneously scale-free and small-world. To this end, we derive the recursive relations for all eigenvalues, especially the second largest eigenvalue modulus of the transition matrix, based on which we deduce a lower bound for the mixing time of the Apollonian network, which approximately scales sublinearly with $N$. Our results indicate that real-world networks are not always fast mixing, which has potential implications in the design of algorithms related to mixing time.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433168","random walk;mixing time;normalized Laplacian;social networks;fast mixing","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Due to the stringent demands of WBAN, such as energy efficiency, reliability and low delay, the development of an efficient contention control algorithm is exceptionally crucial that aims to maximize throughput by reducing collisions. In this context, this paper proposes an adaptive algorithm, namely, Prioritization and Contention Control (PCC) algorithm, to minimize collisions, latency and energy consumption. The first phase of the proposed algorithm prioritizes sensors using run-time metrics to grant channel access only for the potential nodes to send their data. It leads to a lesser number of collisions among sensors, thereby reducing retransmission attempts. In the second phase, the Contention Window (CW) size is predicted using queue length and collision rate that accurately mimic the current channel status. The dynamic estimation of CW aids in minimizing channel access delay, collisions and energy consumption, thereby enhancing overall network performance. The performance of the proposed PCC algorithm is validated with the 2D Markov model and NS2 simulation in terms of throughput, packet delivery ratio, delay and remaining energy.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433166","WBAN;IEEE 802.15.6;MAC;Contention Control;Markov Model;NS2","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This protocol is proposed as an enhancement over ordered contention MAC (OCMAC) protocol to deal with bursty traffic by reducing transmission collisions. It does so by enabling nodes to employ multichannel technique along with the scheduling technique of OCMAC. The protocol uses separate channels for channel reservation and data transmission.

Conventional methods of disease diagnosis are primarily based on CBR with reference to user-provided symptoms; however, in most cases, user-provided symptoms do not fully meet the requirements of CBR. To address this problem, fuzzy logic is incorporated into CBR to allow for more flexible and accurate models. With the help of CBR and fuzzy reasoning, three diagnostic results can be obtained by the cotton disease diagnosis system (CDDS) constructed in this study: success, success but not exact and failure. To verify the reliability of the CDDS and its ability to diagnose cotton diseases, its diagnostic accuracy and stability were analyzed and compared with the results obtained by the traditional expert scoring method. The analysis results reveal that the CDDS can achieve a high diagnostic success rate (above 90%) and better diagnostic stability than the traditional expert scoring method when at least four disease symptoms are input. The CDDS provides an independent and objective source of information to assist farmers in the diagnosis and prevention of cotton diseases.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433162","CBR;fuzzy logic;diagnosis;cotton diseases","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the study of query-based trading in the user data market is still in the initial stage. To design a practical user data trading mechanism, we have to consider three major challenges: privacy concern, compensation cost minimization and revenue maximization in a Bayesian environment. By jointly considering these challenges, we propose a profit-maximizing mechanism for user data trading with personalized differential privacy, called READ, which comprised two components, READ-COST for cost minimization and READ-REV for revenue maximization. Especially, READ adopts personalized differential privacy to satisfy each data owner’s diverse privacy preferences. READ-COST greedily selects the most cost-effective data owner to achieve the sub-optimal data query cost. Given this query cost, READ-REV calculates the maximum expected revenue in a Bayesian setting. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and real-data based experiments, we demonstrate that READ achieves all desired properties and approaches the optimal profit.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433171","query service;data trading;personalized differential privacy","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Therefore, we implemented sentiment analysis to make the process automatically. The entire process includes data collection, pre-processing, word embedding, sentiment detection and classification using deep learning techniques. Twitter was chosen as the source of data collection and tweets collected automatically by using Tweepy. In this paper, three deep learning techniques were implemented, which are CNN, Bi-LSTM and CNN-Bi-LSTM. Each of the models trained on three datasets consists of 50K, 100K and 200K tweets. The experimental result revealed that, with the increasing amount of training data size, the performance of the models improved, especially the performance of the Bi-LSTM model. When the model trained on the 200K dataset, it achieved about 3% higher accuracy than the 100K dataset and achieved about 7% higher accuracy than the 50K dataset.

However, owing to the volume of data, users are encountering a difficulty to accede to the preferred events according to their features that are stored in their social network profiles. To surmount this limitation, multiple event recommendation systems appeared. Nevertheless, these systems use a limited number of event dimensions and user’s features. Besides, they consider users’ features stored in a single user’s profile and disregard the semantic concept. In this research, an approach for multi-dimensional event recommendation is set forward to recommend events to users resting on several event dimensions (engagement, location, topic, time and popularity) and some user’s features (demographic data, position and user’s/friend’s interests) stored in multi-user’s profiles by considering the semantic relationships between user’s features, specifically user’s interests. The performance of our approach was assessed using error rate measurements (mean absolute error, root mean squared error and cross-validation).

The wrapper-enabled feature selection is employed for selecting the highly significant features that are generated using the technical indicators. The highly significant features of the data are fed to the prediction module, which is developed using the NARX model.

It is a DG enhancement of the derived category $D({{\mathcal{A}}})$ of ${{\mathcal{A}}}$, which is isomorphic to the category of DG ${{\mathcal{A}}}$-modules with ${A_{\infty }}$-morphisms between them. However, it is defined intrinsically in the language of DG categories and requires no complex machinery or sign conventions of ${A_{\infty }}$-categories. We define for these bar categories Tensor and Hom bifunctors, dualisation functors, and a convolution of twisted complexes. The intended application is to working with DG-bimodules as enhancements of exact functors between triangulated categories. As a demonstration, we develop a homotopy adjunction theory for tensor functors between derived categories of DG categories. It allows us to show in an enhanced setting that given a functor $F$ with left and right adjoints $L$ and $R$, the functorial complex $FR \xrightarrow{F{\operatorname{act}}{R}} FRFR \xrightarrow{FR{\operatorname{tr}} - {\operatorname{tr}}{FR}} FR \xrightarrow{{\operatorname{tr}}} {\operatorname{Id}}$ lifts to a canonical twisted complex whose convolution is the square of the spherical twist of $F$.

Our results apply to a wide class of groups, including non-virtually solvable fundamental groups of 3-manifold groups, generalised Baumslag–Solitar groups and almost all one-relator groups and graph products of groups. It follows that groups in the class satisfy a number of algebraic properties: for instance, their verbal subgroups have infinite width and, although some groups in the class are simple, they cannot be boundedly simple. In order to prove these results, we describe a uniform way for constructing (weak) small cancellation tuples from (weakly) stable elements. This result of interest in its own is fundamental to obtain corollaries of general nature such as a quantifier reduction for positive sentences or the preservation of the non-trivial positive theory under extensions of groups.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433058","","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

At the same time, transitive Courant algebroids may be viewed as the higher analog of Atiyah Lie algebroids and the noncommutative analog of exact Courant algebroids. In this article, we explore what the “principal bundles” behind transitive Courant algebroids are, and they turn out to be principal 2-bundles of string groups. First, we construct the stack of principal 2-bundles of string groups with connection data. We prove a lifting theorem for the stack of string principal bundles with connections and show the multiplicity of the lifts once they exist. This is a differential geometrical refinement of what is known for string structures by Redden, Waldorf, and Stolz–Teichner. We also extend the result of Bressler and Chen et al. on extension obstruction involving transitive Courant algebroids to the case of transitive Courant algebroids with connections, as a lifting theorem with the description of multiplicity once liftings exist. At the end, we build a morphism between these two stacks.

We show that the ideal simplicial volume is bounded above by the ordinary simplicial volume, and that it vanishes if and only if the ordinary simplicial volume does. We show that, for manifolds with amenable boundary, the ideal simplicial volume coincides with the classical one, whereas for hyperbolic manifolds with geodesic boundary it can be strictly smaller. We compute the ideal simplicial volume of an infinite family of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds with geodesic boundary, for which the exact value of the classical simplicial volume is not known, and we exhibit examples where the ideal simplicial volume provides sharper bounds on mapping degrees than the classical simplicial volume.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rny302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433115","","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By work of Harris and Kim, we now know that these conjectures in the generality stated may not always be valid. In this paper we show that in the context of hyperrigid tensor algebras of $\mathrm{C}^*$-correspondences, each one of these conjectures is equivalent to the Hao–Ng problem. This is accomplished by studying the representation theory of non-selfadjoint crossed products of C$^*$-correspondence dynamical systems; in particular we show that there is an appropriate dilation theory. A large class of tensor algebras of $\mathrm{C}^*$-correspondences, including all regular ones, are shown to be hyperrigid. Using Hamana's injective envelope theory, we extend earlier results from the discrete group case to arbitrary locally compact groups; this includes a resolution of the Hao–Ng isomorphism for the reduced crossed product and all hyperrigid $\mathrm{C}^*$-correspondences. A culmination of these results is the resolution of the Hao–Ng isomorphism problem for the full crossed product and all row-finite graph correspondences; this extends a recent result of Bedos, Kaliszewski, Quigg, and Spielberg.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnz271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433045","","","","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This paper focuses on Non-isolated Bidirectional Interleaved DC- DC Converter (NIBIC) with battery storage. The NIBIC is controlled based on the voltage of the DC bus, connected to photovoltaic sources with maximum power point tracking technique (MPPT) via boost converter and load. The control circuit of bidirectional DC-DC converter includes current and voltage loop for operating the converter under different operating modes.

Here Cooperative diversity combining is incorporated with relay nodes in multipath fading environment to improve the secrecy performance in terms of Secrecy Outage Probability and Bit Error Rate (BER). The secrecy rate of the cognitive radio network has been analyzed with and without relay. It is obvious that Maximal ratio combining outperforms Selection combining scheme since the signals from each channel are added together. From the numerical results it is evident that BER comes down to 10-3 which is the required standard value for the wireless fading environment.

In engineering applications, the estimation of the state of a ballistic missile is an important requirement for the reliable deployment of an anti ballistic missile (ABM) system. But during the measurement of its flight through radar there are many disturbances that tend to add significant amount of error in its readings thus reducing the effectiveness of ballistic missile defense system. Many researches conducted in the field estimated the state of the missile and tried to minimize the error by using various techniques such as Bayesian theorem, Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter. This research examines the Radar related errors, studies the extent of its impacton ABM system and proposes a solution to minimize the errors and increase the effectiveness of the system. The results obtained are used for error estimation in the filtered radar data and theoretically predicted trajectory of the missile.

The machinery used gases and the concentration of stored assets result in high risks. This system is capable of detecting fire and provides an alert to the workers. Raspberry Pi 3 has been used which is integrated with a couple of sensors and a camera. The system uses gas sensor to detect gas leakage, PIR sensor detects intrusion and the flame sensor detects fire. The sensors constantly sense and keep on transmitting values to the online web server over a Wi-Fi connection. If fire due to an intruder is detected, the camera captures the image and the system will immediately send an email alert along with the image of the affected spot to the industry owner. Once the fire is detected by the flame sensor, fire alarm will be generated to alert the workers, the sprinkler motor will be activated. The server can be viewed from anywhere for sensor information such as concentration of gases, fire and motion detection. With such intelligent information, safety managers, workers, and fire fighters will also be able to make better decisions for fire response.","","978-1-7281-1528-3","10.1109/ICCI46240.2019.9404469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9404469","industry;iot;raspberry pi;sensors;security","Gases;Fires;Cameras;Sensor systems;Web servers;Telecommunication computing;Security","alarm systems;electronic mail;file servers;fires;gas sensors;industrial accidents;Internet;Internet of Things;leak detection;microcomputers;process monitoring;production engineering computing;security;wireless LAN","IOT approach;security surveillance system;industrial process monitoring;fire protection;fire security;Raspberry Pi 3;gas sensor;gas leakage;PIR sensor;flame sensor;online web server;Wi-Fi connection;email alert;fire alarm;sensor information","","2","","4","IEEE","23 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of coils of different sizes in the transmitter array is proposed in order to eliminate the splitting of the magnetic field produced by the transmitters. This is done by designing three different multi-coil transmitter arrays, each with five transmitter coils with a single receiver coil placed 40 cm from the transmitters. The first array is designed with coils of the same size. The second and third arrays are designed with coils of smaller sizes placed between larger size coils. The performance of the three arrays is compared by considering the scattering parameters at the receiver coil. It is shown that using smaller coil sizes between larger coils causes uniform coupling in the multiple transmitter array, resulting in suppression and subsequent elimination of the frequency splitting phenomenon of the received signal.","","978-1-7281-0486-7","10.1109/ICMRSISIIT46373.2020.9405831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405831","multiple transmitter array;resonant coupling;frequency splitting","Couplings;Mechatronics;Transmitters;Receivers;Wireless power transfer;Scattering parameters;Magnetic fields","coils;inductive power transmission;S-parameters","frequency splitting elimination;multicoil power transfer system;single receiver coil;multicoil transmitter arrays;multiple transmitter coil wireless power transfer system;scattering parameters;size 40.0 cm","","","","18","IEEE","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The LNA is used in communication systems to amplify very weak signals captured by an antenna. The design of an LNA in Microwave circuits requires a trade-off or careful balance of many important parameters such as Gain, Noise Figure (NF), and Stability. In view of this, it is essential to make calculated choices to realize an optimally functioning LNA. This paper presents a single stage 2.0 GHz LNA optimal design using lumped elements (discrete passive components) for the input and output matching networks. The Radio Frequency (RF) transistor used for this design is the ATF-21170, which is modelled by its Scattering (S) parameters. This is a high performance, low noise Gallium Arsenide Schottky barrier-gate Field Effect Transistor. The LNA is designed using conventional techniques to boost weak cell signals in the frequency range of 1.8GHz to 2.6GHz. The design is done with the aid of Advanced Design System (ADS) 2020 software.

Dialogue Systems are also augmented with Robots to improve human-robot dialogues.Conversational Agents are classified into two main types: Social bots/Chitchat bots and Task Oriented Dialogue Agents. Social bots aim to engage user with unstructured human conversations. These dialogue agents don't have fixed aim to complete and focus more on carrying out open domain conversations. For example ALIZA, Microsoft XiaoIce etcOn the other hand, Task oriented dialogue agents help user to accomplish certain tasks in specific domains like Restaurant booking, Flight reservation, customer support etc. These are popularly used in controlling home appliances and carrying out simple tasks by users in day to day life.

There is increasing interest in building task completion dialogue agents that span over multiple sub-domains to accomplish a complex user goal.With the increasing acceptance of Dialogue Agents, there is need of high-quality, large-scale dialogue datasets for better performance of task oriented dialogue agent in changing environment. Neural approaches are applied to design intelligent dialogue agents frequently which require very large datasets. However, there are following challenges while building intelligent task completion dialogue systems. Firstly, there are a lot of datasets available for chit-chat bots but they are not directly relevant to task oriented systems.

The nature-inspired method aid in mapping IoT-edge computing devices used by the water and sewage workers, especially in the cities and urban areas, to find and locate leaked pipelines. Once, a water and sewage worker receive a trigger from any location that there are leakages, the algorithm generates the location data which automatically processes the distance, geographic location, and direction. In this paper, a nature-inspired algorithm based on the behaviour of a Kestrel bird was used as the mapping function. The developed algorithm was tested and evaluated using pre-defined and random locations based on their latitudes and longitudinal data. The proposed algorithm was evaluated against BAT algorithm.

Due to this, the effect of high latency, noise and interference in communication networks is one major challenge that pose great danger to faster and successful data transmission. We use data obtained from the software tool (ICMP) which recorded the ping statistics and (SPSS) in data coding and analysis.

Because of this property, RNS is extensively used in communication, Finite Impulse Response (FIR), cryptography, and signal processing devices. The transfer of data in digital channel is very important for some critical applications where accuracy is very important. This work proposes a novel algorithm that is premised on the Hamming Distance (HD) and one of the reverse conversion methods, which is, the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and as a joint technique for detecting and correcting multiple bit errors in RNS. The algorithm provides more efficient technique that improves on the hardware size and increases the processing speed with less iterations when compared with other state-of-the-art schemes. An area-delay comparison analysis done and compared with other known schemes in this work revealed the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of area and delay requirements.","","978-1-7281-0486-7","10.1109/ICMRSISIIT46373.2020.9405850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405850","Residue Number System;Mixed Radix Conversion;Hamming Distance;Digital Signal Processing;Computer Architecture","Performance evaluation;Heuristic algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Computer architecture;Cathode ray tubes;Signal processing;Hardware","error correction codes;error detection codes;Hamming codes;iterative methods;residue number systems","unweighted number system;RNS;finite impulse response;FIR;cryptography;signal processing devices;digital channel;critical applications;Hamming distance;reverse conversion methods;Chinese Remainder Theorem;area-delay comparison analysis;RRNS architecture;redundant residue number system;multiple bit error detection correction;area requirements;delay requirements","","","","27","IEEE","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study investigated the effect of covid-19 on education from the perspective of primary and high school children staying at home in Ghana. Due to the pandemic, the descriptive study drew respondents across the country using snowball sampling via the internet (social media, email, WhatsApp, etc). Results lead to major conclusions that children employed both manual and/or online methods of learning at home mostly relying on parents' electronic gadgets and/or computers. They faced mostly issues of bad internet connectivity and expensive data while learning online. Majority (54.6%) claimed they want to resume school amid the pandemic because they mostly miss their friends and teachers and also sometimes needs help studying at home. The strong minority (45.4%) prefer to stay home for fear of infecting their family members.

The progressive histogram quantization (PHQ) is a simple iterative algorithm where a single histogram bin is merged to one of its two nearest neighbors' bins at each iteration. The histogram bin is merged according to the differences in the value (pixel counts) and the location of the left and right bins. The PHQ algorithm is used as a pre-quantization for the Kmeans clustering to reduce the size of the data and speed up the clustering process. The experimental results show that the PHQ+Kmeans algorithm maintains good image quality and enhances the execution time compared to the Kmeans clustering algorithm alone when applied on remote sensing images.","","978-1-7281-0486-7","10.1109/ICMRSISIIT46373.2020.9405957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405957","Color Quantization;Progressive Histogram Quantization;Kmeans clustering","Image quality;Histograms;Quantization (signal);Mechatronics;Image color analysis;Clustering algorithms;Tools","computer vision;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image colour analysis;image segmentation;iterative methods;nearest neighbour methods;pattern clustering;remote sensing","image color reduction;progressive histogram quantization;image processing;computer vision applications;progressive histogram-based color reduction;Kmeans clustering algorithm;simple iterative algorithm;single histogram bin;nearest neighbors;pre-quantization;PHQ+Kmeans algorithm;remote sensing images","","","","14","IEEE","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores the relationship between manage services and the operations of mobile telecommunications in Ghana. The study focused on one of the prominent telecommunications companies in Ghana and its managed service providers. Using primary and secondary data obtained from interviews and incident dashboard from service Management tool of MSPs respectively, studies were conducted on the cooperation of MSPs, their adherence to SLAs and cost savings as a means to measure the impact of managed services on the business operations of Mobile Telecommunication Companies in Ghana. The results revealed that the level of cooperation between MSPs towards service delivery is generally good. However, the MSPs level of adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is low according to the Case company respondents although the MSPs claimed their adherence to SLA was high. Service dashboard data on the other hand confirmed that the MSPs are in fact meeting the SLAs.

The algorithm is based on the three-sigma rule of leverage statistics but here the recursion is truncated using a tolerance convergence level defined in a classifier or with the help of a convergence graph. The justification of the algorithm has been established and was implemented with the US Dollar-Ghana Cedi log-returns as a Lebesgue unimodal data. The jump dynamics show that the jump size and jump time are random and independent; jump size is time-invariant and jump time intervals obey the Markov chain property of time inhomogeneity. There were more positive jumps (depreciation of the cedi) than negative jumps (appreciation of the cedi) but the magnitude of the negative jumps is higher than that of the positive jumps.","","978-1-7281-0480-5","10.1109/ICDSA46371.2019.9404237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9404237","dollar-cedi;stochastic process;algorithm;machine learning;jump-diffusion;jump dynamics","Machine learning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning;Filtering algorithms;Tools;Nonhomogeneous media;Classification algorithms","foreign exchange trading;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;pattern classification;probability;random processes;stochastic processes","positive jumps;negative jumps;jump dynamics;US Dollar-Ghana Cedi exchange returns;US Dollar-Ghana Cedi log-returns;machine learning tools;classifier;jump size;jump time intervals;correlated multifactor stochastic variance jump diffusion;CMSVJD;three-sigma rule;leverage statistics;tolerance convergence level;convergence graph;Markov chain property;Lebesgue unimodal data","","","","31","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are two types of tumors present in the brain, and they are malignant and benign tumors. Benign tumors are non-cancerous tumors which reside inside a person's brain having a primitive shape and size. Malignant tumors are cancerous brain tumors which spread by transforming the cells into the cell type next to the malignant tumor and have no clearly defined edge or shape(cloudy). Treatment planning and detection is the most efficient way of treating a patient and improving the condition. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the established method to detect the tumors. After the detection classification of the tumor manually takes reasonable time and sometimes it is impossible to detect the type with the naked eye. This results in having to conduct a biopsy which is a risk as well as sometimes impossible. One of the main factors to be considered in segmenting the tumor is the edge intensity of the tumor. For detecting the intensity of the tumor edge a novel completely automatic and reliable detection based on CNN is proposed. Pre-processing and running the improved images through CNN to get the best possible features to be extracted from the MRI images. Canny edge detection and Wavelet transform are applied to detect the edge and finally, Hough transform is used to detect the intensity of the edge. Edge detection method that proposed in this paper will have a wide verity of surgical applications.","","978-1-7281-6199-0","10.1109/ICITR49409.2019.9407795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407795","BenignTumors;Malignant Tumors;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Convolutional Neural Networks","Wavelet transforms;Image edge detection;Magnetic resonance imaging;Noise reduction;Neural networks;Benign tumors;Surgery","biological organs;biomedical MRI;brain;cancer;edge detection;feature extraction;Hough transforms;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;tumours;wavelet transforms","benign tumors;noncancerous tumors;malignant tumor;cancerous brain tumors;tumor edge;MRI images;canny edge detection;edge detection method;brain tumor","","1","","17","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It tracks and analyses data from large information streams pertaining to a string of related or non-related events in order to identify patterns and relations that could be used to derive useful connections among seemingly unrelated factors within its applications. CEP systems make use of pattern queries to match identified events within an event stream. However, due to the generalized nature of CEP query languages and the lack of general structure and semantics, it is difficult to write queries that function optimally to deliver the expected results within the required time frames. This issue is particularly of importance as CEP systems often deal with time sensitive data and hence require rapid processing in order to output useful information and hence, defines the importance and requirement for query optimization techniques that may be applied to CEP systems. This paper focuses on research publications related to the four main pattern query optimization techniques, namely, Multi-Query Optimization, Join Query Optimization, Nested Query Processing techniques and Query Rewriting as well as their applications within modern CEP systems. This study further aims to identify possible limitations within the four techniques mentioned previously and advise on possible measures that may be taken to further improve these techniques in order to offer greater efficiency and stability to pattern query processing within CEP systems.","","978-1-7281-6199-0","10.1109/ICITR49409.2019.9407794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407794","Complex event processing;pattern queries;optimization;CEP models;query rewriting","Query processing;Semantics;Finance;Stability analysis;Information technology;Database languages;Pattern matching","data analysis;query languages;query processing;rewriting systems","multiquery optimization;join query optimization;query rewriting;modern CEP systems;pattern query processing;complex event processing systems;data analysis;information streams;CEP query languages;time sensitive data;pattern query optimization;nested query processing","","","","23","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Not all bots are malicious but these automated accounts are largely responsible for platform manipulation, which is the process of misleading, disrupting the experience of other users by engaging in deceptive, aggressive activities. There are many politically motivated groups in Facebook and Twitter who use various levels of manipulation to influence voters and thereby undermining the democratic process. Platform manipulation is not only carried out by malicious automation, but also with spam and inauthentic accounts (fake accounts). This paper presents novel methodology to detect these bots (automated accounts) using existing research as foundation and builds new research solution to the problem. This methodology can be applied to the news domain to find bots involved in spreading false information.

In this research, we present a 4ONSE network as a complementary to professional, state-owned weather station network. This open network was built on 4 open pillars – open hardware, open software, open standards and open data. Credibility of the network was assessed by analyzing the reliability and accuracy of data, cost incurred in building the station and conformity of measured parameters with WMO standards. Even though the 4ONSE station is not a high tech, professional weather station, these mini stations can be used to filling the gaps left by professional weather stations.

To provide a better environment to them, some researchers investigate the affection of light and noise in the NICU on the formation of the sleep-wake cycle of the newborn called Circadian rhythm. These researches require the optimal evaluation method of the sleep-wake state. The visual assessment by nurses do not guarantee enough inter-tester reliability, and the measurement puts an additional burden on them. The conventional sleep-wake states discrimination method requires attachment devices on the subject's body. This paper proposes the automatic classification method of the sleep-wake states of neonates by using only facial information. In this research, we extract gradient features and spatio-temporal HOGV features from 3,600 face image frames (1 minute). According to Blazelton's method, this study classifies the sleep-wake states into six classes by using machine learning techniques. Support Vector Machine and Random Forest were used in the experiment. The spatio-temporal HOGV feature is an extension of the HOG feature to the time domain. The experiments using two kinds of feature quantities and classifiers showed that the highest accuracy rate (54.4%) was obtained by the gradient feature and Random Forest. This result suggested the possibility of improving accuracy by combining facial information with body movement and other conventional features.","","978-1-7281-6199-0","10.1109/ICITR49409.2019.9407788","Kyushu University; Mie University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407788","Sleep-Wake States;Neonates;Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS);Classifying;Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU);Facial Video Analysis","Support vector machines;Pediatrics;Visualization;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Face detection;Reliability","circadian rhythms;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;paediatrics;patient care;sleep;support vector machines;video signal processing","Neonatal sleep-wake states;facial video analysis;NICU;Neonatal Intensive Care Unit;sleep-wake cycle;optimal evaluation method;sleep-wake state;conventional sleep-wake states discrimination method;automatic classification method;facial information;gradient feature;spatio-temporal HOGV feature;random forest;time 1.0 min","","1","","19","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technology is beneficial in increasing safety of the driver and passengers, and also has affect in reducing the public cost of society safety. This study proposes a driver assistive tool for elder drivers which respond immediately in case of potential accidents by giving appropriate warning or arrestments. This tool monitors the movement of the vehicle dynamically with the behavior of the driver, detects the irregularity between the driver and the vehicle. Sensory devices which have been installed in the vehicle include the imaging camera, inertial measurement unit, Lidar scanner, steering wheel angle sensor, depression sensors on accelerator pedal and brake pedal to form a sensory network for the purpose of collecting signals for irregularity identification. In order to detect the surrounding suspicious objects, an array of ultrasonic sensors was installed on the vehicle and to evaluate the irregularity level of the danger, a sensor harness was integrated. When the risk level reaches a significant level, a danger classification information will be delivered to the processing center and a corresponding ensemble of sensory feedback will be activated to remind to the driver.

In addition, CM-OCR methods usually employ a script identification step before character recognition. Recent approaches for script identification depend on a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) thanks to its promising performance in the image recognition task. However, researchers mentioned the importance to understand the decision criteria in CNNs as a warning to employ them for actual tasks as black-box classifiers. Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate the hyperparameter dependence of CNNs and to visualize the region focused by CNNs in the task of script identification. In this research, we applied Grad-CAM to the script identification task of image classification and used the SIW-13 dataset. We investigated the learning progress of CNNs by defining the value used in Grad-CAM as the ""reaction"" and visualized the region focused by CNNs in script identification. As a result, the learning process was stabilized in the case that the number of hyperparameters was sufficient for the given training samples even though the hyperparameters which should be tuned were increased. This result demonstrated that the capacity to stably learn training samples depends on the number of hyperparameters. In the insufficient capacity case, the learning process was destabilized and it caused scripts with relatively low accuracy. Analyzing one of the low accuracy scripts of the model using Grad-CAM, we found that some failures progress greatly changes by the difference in hyperparameters of CNNs. Scatter plots of the reaction and the probability clarified the capacity of CNNs in each script.","","978-1-7281-6199-0","10.1109/ICITR49409.2019.9407784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407784","CM-OCR;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Grad-CAM;Scene Text Script;Script Identification","Training;Visualization;Image recognition;Optical computing;Optical imaging;Character recognition;Optical scattering","document handling;document image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optical character recognition","learning progress;CNNs;script identification step;image recognition task;Grad-CAM;script identification task;learning process;low accuracy scripts;camera-based multilingual optical character recognition","","","","21","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The task of speaker identification consists of three main phases which are feature extraction, feature embedding and voice classification. Speaker embedding is the process of modeling the voice of a person where the model of the utterance can uniquely represent the speaker of that voice. Speaker embedding is a commonly used method in Automatic Speaker Recognition systems to identify the voice of the speaker. Currently, Deep Neural Networks based approaches are used in these systems for speech feature extraction and speech embedding. The performances of different approaches heavily depend on the noise factor and suitability of selected features of the audio data. MFCC, LPC, Dimensional filter banks are some of the frequently used speech features in speaker recognition. This speaker recognition research focuses on the usage of speech features for speaker embedding that are fitting for the speaker identification in conversational environment using a Convolutional Neural Network based approach.","","978-1-7281-6199-0","10.1109/ICITR49409.2019.9407789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407789","MFCC;LPC;GMM;UBM;i-vector;DNN;RNN;CNN;VQ;PLDA","Training;Neural networks;Fitting;Speech recognition;Feature extraction;Data models;Speaker recognition","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;speaker recognition","speaker identification;conversational speeches;automatic speaker recognition systems;speech feature extraction;speech embedding;feature based speaker embedding;voice classification;deep neural networks;MFCC;LPC;dimensional filter banks;convolutional neural network","","","","16","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some transient stability parameters of a specific fault in the system, such as critical fault clearing time and oscillation finishing time are used to determine some deterministic transition rates.

Rapid developing of software of engineering problems and hardware, taken place for the last few decades significantly widens numerical research capabilities. Presently numerical modeling and computer simulation are widely used as primary research tool for the most of engineering problems. Therefore, ensuring the adequacy of mathematical models requires a comprehensive study of the features of simulation tools in relation to the problems to be solved. The switching transitional processes in high-voltage systems are formalized in mathematical models as the system of first order “stiff” differential and algebraic-differential equations with nonlinearity and some logical conditions for setting current interruptions (current chopping) and arc's repeated restrikes and re-ignitions, that determines complexity of the problem.

In the structure of renewable generation, the output from wind and solar power plants generally exceeds the output from other renewable sources. The probabilistic-fuzzy nature of wind power and solar plants, as well as the stochasticity of the load power leads to random variability of voltage and power flows in the electrical networks of the system. The effect of random-indefinite variability of mode in the network may increase with the growth of power from wind and solar plants integrated into the system. In this paper we propose probabilistic fuzzy models that describe the power system state variability caused by the load and generation stochasticity. The proposed models are presented in the form of the Gauss fuzzy description with varying center and width for the membership functions of the mode parameters that determine the system state. It is shown that the proposed models allow for approximating the current and forecasting values of its parameters with a higher accuracy on the basis of simultaneous consideration of stochasticity and uncertainty in the variability of the power system state. The paper consists of introduction, which formulates the problem of modeling of the power system state, taking into account the stochasticity and uncertainty of its variability, in the form of a probabilistic fuzzy set; in the second section the procedure for the identifying the model structure of the probabilistic fuzzy set in relation to the description of the random variability of the system state caused by the load power stochasticity is proposed; in the third section an analysis of the simulation results of the power system state represented by the fuzzy description for the voltage vector and power flows in the network is provided.","","978-1-7281-1641-9","10.1109/MEPS46793.2019.9395036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395036","power grid;renewable energy sources;probabilistic fuzzy model;probability density function;membership function","Uncertainty;Predictive models;Wind power generation;Probabilistic logic;Power grids;Load modeling;Load flow","fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;load flow;power generation control;power grids;probability;solar power;solar power stations","stochastic nature;electric power industry;renewable sources;consumer electric networks;renewable generation;solar power plants;probabilistic-fuzzy nature;wind power;solar plants;random variability;power flows;electrical networks;random-indefinite variability;probabilistic fuzzy models;power system state variability;generation stochasticity;probabilistic fuzzy set;load power stochasticity;grid steady state evaluation;time 20.0 year to 30.0 year","","","","14","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper the results of three different approaches to assess the feasibility of intentional islanding is presented using generic power system model. The study targets to identify on high level the criteria for successful islanding based on the system's main characteristics with a wide variety of operating conditions. The operating conditions were executed by varying size of the studied system, imbalance level at the time of islanding and the response speed of the turbine governor. The conditions were derived so that they can be considered to represent on a general level, the possible regional islands and their generation portfolio in Finland. Size of the possible regional islands was represented by varying the kinetic energy of the rotating masses. The results showed that the frequency response stayed within tolerable limits when the total imbalance was maximum of 1.25 % of the total kinetic energy of the rotating masses, i.e. very a narrow range of the studied combinations. Based on the results, it can also be concluded that turbine speed control parameters, tuned for certain size of system, do not likely perform in an adequate manner when the rotational kinetic energy of the systems varies. Considering the results of the study, it seems that the required combinations for robust island may be very rarely available because of the present market-based electricity generation allocation and configuration. However, separate system specific studies to address the possibility of intentional islanding should be performed considering the actual availability and variations of generation and the actual power system configurations.","","978-1-7281-1641-9","10.1109/MEPS46793.2019.9395001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395001","Islanding;synchronous generator;system inertia;frequency controller;frequency deviation","Islanding;Velocity control;Power systems;Kinetic energy;Resource management;Turbines;Portfolios","distributed power generation;frequency response;hydraulic turbines;investment;power distribution economics;power distribution faults;power distribution reliability;power generation control;power generation economics;power generation reliability;power markets;velocity control","rotating masses;turbine speed control parameters;rotational kinetic energy;market-based electricity generation allocation;intentional islanding;power system configurations;generic power system model;operating conditions;imbalance level;regional islands;black-out prevention;generation portfolio;Finland;frequency response;turbine governor","","","","16","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The considered type of overvoltage refers to durable internal overvoltages, which have characteristics that can exceed the maximum permissible magnitude with a certain correlation of the values of the parameters of the extra high voltage power transmission line 750 kV. A typical example of a non-sinusoidal mode of operation of an extra high voltage line is the mode of switching on the line to an unloaded autotransformer. It should be noted that this mode is accompanied not only by resonant overvoltages, but also by inrush currents of magnetization. As a result, modern developers of controlled switching devices should choose switch-on settings for successful solution of two tasks: suppression of inrush current and resonant overvoltage. The paper analyzes the effect of remanent magnetization of an unloaded autotransformer on resonant overvoltages. To remove the remanent magnetization of the autotransformer, a set of effective measures for suppressing resonant overvoltages has been proposed.","","978-1-7281-1641-9","10.1109/MEPS46793.2019.9395035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395035","non-sinusoidal mode;controlled switching;abnormal resonant overvoltages;remanent flux;inrush currents","Performance evaluation;Magnetization;Switches;Power system harmonics;Harmonic analysis;Control systems;Surges","autotransformers;inrush current;magnetisation;overvoltage;power transmission lines;remanence","resonant overvoltage;nonsinusoidal mode;durable internal overvoltages;high voltage power transmission line;unloaded autotransformer;remanent magnetization;remanent flux evaluation;bulk electrical networks;maximum permissible magnitude;magnetization inrush currents;switching devices;switch-on settings;voltage 750.0 kV","","1","","9","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to cope with this, new technical solutions are required as well as practical testing of the present protection ideas are needed.

The analysis and study of the problems arising during the application of modern technologies to ensure the power grid reliability are topical in adjustment of frequency, voltage and capacity to ensure the regime reliability on such power route. From this point of view, in high-voltage system-forming and inter-system electrical networks, it is of particular importance to conduct research on the forming of a control system based on modern technologies, the placement of FACTS devices in the part of control shunt reactors (CSR) to compensate the charging capability. Thus, in high-voltage system-forming and inter-system electric networks, the use of charging capability compensation means for power transmission lines (PTL) creates an opportunity to ensure a sufficiently high reliability and efficiency of the power system mode. On both sides of 500 kV PTL of the power grid, relevant research work was carried out in connection with the placement and control of the FACTS devices of CSR. These works represent the research related to the development and implementation of the methods and algorithms of CSR control mainly on the basis of traditional and non-traditional mathematical technologies. However, in the works under consideration the questions of adequacy of planned and unplanned switch-ons of system elements (power lines, generators, transformers) of the given methods and algorithms were considered insufficiently. This work represents the results of the development and computer implementation of the methods and algorithms for controlling the CSR device in the state of shift switch-ons (N-1 criterion) of the power grid elements using the mathematical fuzzy logic apparatus. The obtained results confirm the reactive power compensation and bus voltage stabilization during its controlling high-voltage networks during the short-term plannings of maintenance modes and, therefore, the possibility of provision for the power grid voltage stability.","","978-1-7281-1641-9","10.1109/MEPS46793.2019.9395043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395043","power grid;high-voltage electric network;regime reliability;repair mode;power transmission line;controlled shunt reactor;fuzzy logic theory","Shunts (electrical);Computer network reliability;Switches;Power system stability;Power grids;Power system reliability;Voltage control","flexible AC transmission systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;power engineering computing;power grids;power system stability;power transmission control;power transmission lines;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;reactive power;reactors (electric)","high-voltage power network;maintenance modes;fuzzy logic theory;DC device;power grid reliability;inter-system electrical networks;FACTS devices;control shunt reactors;power transmission lines;power system mode;CSR device;reactive power compensation;bus voltage stabilization;power grid voltage stability;mathematical technologies;nonsynchronous communication;PTL;short-term plannings;voltage 500.0 kV","","1","","11","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet the transformer reliability is highly impacted by its cooling medium and the contaminants within the cooling medium. These contaminants account for roughly 15% of transformer failures. Contaminants such as water can be harmful to the transformer, will reduce its reliability, and, consequently, the electrical system reliability. Therefore, moisture must be eliminated from the cooling medium as well as the insulation paper of the transformer. In this paper, an online oil drying system technology is implemented on a 69/13.8 kV transformer with more than 35 years in service. The technology removes moistures from transformer’s oil and the winding insulation paper. This paper also illustrate the working principle of this technology. The importance of this technology comes from the fact that the drying process is conducted while the power transformer is in service. Hence, no outage is required. The ultimate purpose of transformer dehydration is to increase the transformer reliability and extend its service life. This paper analyzes the performance of the online dehydration technology and compares it to offline methods.

In Germany, both DER and EVs are installed in the electrical grid primarily at the low-voltage level. In order to ensure grid stability in the future, energy generation by DER and charging of EVs must be coordinated locally. At the low-voltage level, however, there is mainly no measurement technology installed which is required for the implementation of a grid-compatible control of the charge EVs and feed-in of DER.

During the first seconds, the energy is taken from the rotating masses in the generator and the turbine. Thereafter, the water flow and thereby the mechanical power are adjusted by governor action to return the turbine to its optimal speed. Two VI control structures are implemented and tested on a VSHP plant simulation model. The virtual synchronous generator (VSG) and the virtual synchronous machine (VSM) are further developed to fulfil the main objective of the control; to maximize the grid support from the VSHP by utilizing the turbine and generator rotational energy. At the same time, the impact on the hydraulic system must be considered in order to fulfil the objectives for internal control of the plant; i.e. to optimize the turbine rotational speed, minimize water hammering and mass oscillations, minimize guide vane servo operation and minimize hydraulic and electric losses. Dynamic analyses are performed to compare the control structures; the power-frequency PID controller with permanent droop (VSG-PID) based on the VSG and the VSM with powerfrequency PID controller and permanent droop (VSM-PID). They are evaluated by two main criteria; their ability to deliver instantaneous power (inertia) to reduce the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and their contribution to frequency containment control (steady state frequency droop response).","","978-1-7281-1641-9","10.1109/MEPS46793.2019.9395013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395013","Virtual inertia;synthetic inertia;virtual synchronous generator;virtual synchronous machine;variable speed hydropower;hydropower;grid integration study","Hydraulic turbines;Velocity control;Hydroelectric power generation;Hydraulic systems;Generators;Synchronous generators;Frequency control","blades;frequency control;hydraulic systems;hydraulic turbines;hydroelectric power stations;machine control;power generation control;power grids;power system stability;servomechanisms;synchronous generators;three-term control","turbine rotational speed;water hammering;mass oscillations;hydraulic losses;electric losses;power-frequency PID controller;VSG-PID;VSM;variable speed hydropower plant;virtual inertia control;grid stability;rotating masses;mechanical power;VI control structures;VSHP plant simulation model;virtual synchronous generator;virtual synchronous machine;hydraulic system;guide vane servo operation;ROCOF;steady state frequency droop response","","","","33","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of them is comprehensive consideration of all the physical phenomena might have notable influence on the process under consideration. For the problem under study these are chopping of switched-off current and arcs' repeated re-strikes and re-ignitions in circuit-breakers, arc resistance etc. Another one is providing stability of transitional functions of voltages and currents due to use appropriate ode solvers and algorithms and also simulation parameters ensuring convergence of solutions. The paper presents results of investigation influence of arc resistance and inertia of current chopping process (slope of chop current) on functions of transitional voltages at switching-off unloaded transformer and unloaded power transmission line by SF6 and vacuum circuit-breakers. The research curried-out allowed us to estimate influence of arc resistance and inertia of the current chopping process on transitional voltages.

One of the steps for creating an energy cluster should be the analysis of electricity consumption profiles. Due to the increasing number of meters with remote reading (Automatic Meter Reading or Advanced Metering Infrastructure) installed at the LV consumers (IV and V connection group), which also enable acquisition and archiving of energy consumption data over long periods of time, it is possible to rely on actual measurement data for creating real load profiles. Due to the current poor access to the actual measurement data for the purpose of creating balances, for this group of consumers, the standard electricity consumption profiles of various types of loads are used. The standard electricity consumption profiles creating and publishing is required from the Distribution system operator. The paper presents the analysis of real profiles of various types of low voltage consumers (belonging to the fourth and fifth connection group) compared to standard profiles.

To eliminate the disoperation of digital relay protection and improve the accuracy of fault location, it is necessary to eliminate the influence of aperiodic components in the currents drawn to the measuring devices of relay protection. The algorithm completely eliminates the aperiodic component at any time constants and is implemented by four samples of currents. The four samples of currents separated by three sampling intervals are sufficient for calculating all the parameters of currents, including the positive and negative-sequence currents, in particular in the case when the magnetic cores of current transformers reach saturation.

Generation from these volatile renewable sources largely depends on the weather, which causes problems on the transmission, e.g., the excess power flow reversing or backfeeding, and the 1ack of production or shortage. These problems cause particular difficulty in the wind power prediction of the power operation system in planning the future schedule. Consequently, inaccuracy of generating future scheduling diminishes the flexibility of the power system.

In this work, a value based reactive power pricing model suitable for real time market is proposed. In the proposed reactive power market model, bids(operation cost and lost opportunity cost(LOC) of reactive power) are received from the Generating Companies (GENCOs) participating in the real time market. From the bids received, a three component reactive power value function is formulated. The components of value function being load serving component, voltage support component and reserve component of reactive power requirement in the system. The objective of the Independent System Operator (ISO) is to minimise the value function of reactive power requirement in the system subject to generator limits, bus voltage limits and transmission line limits. From the Lagrange function of the optimisation problem, the marginal value (MV) of reactive power is derived to calculate the marginal price (MP) of reactive power. The NLP formulation of the market model is solved using DICOPT solver in GAMS and anlaysed on IEEE 24-Bus system. The simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm is efficient in clearing the reactive power market in such a way that the system wide bus voltage deviation is minimal and sufficient reactive power reserve is maintained in the network.","","978-1-7281-1641-9","10.1109/MEPS46793.2019.9395050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395050","Real time reactive power market;value of reactive power;bus voltage support;reactive power reserve;marginal price","Reactive power;Simulation;Pricing;Real-time systems;Mathematical model;Optimization;Load modeling","IEEE standards;nonlinear programming;power markets;power system security;power transmission economics;power transmission lines;pricing;reactive power;real-time systems","real time market;reactive power market model;component reactive power value function;voltage support component;independent system operator;bus voltage limits;marginal value;IEEE 24-bus system;value-based real time reactive power pricing model;voltage security;reserve requirement;ancillary service;operation cost;lost opportunity cost;LOC;GENCOs generating companies;load serving component;ISO;transmission line limits;Lagrange function;optimisation problem;marginal price;MP;NLP formulation;DICOPT solver;GAMS","","","","17","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, several algorithms for event or anomaly detection in electrical power systems are investigated and compared. The proposed algorithms utilize unsupervised training of auto-encoders and Fourier transform-based signal reconstruction.

The influence of the amount of energy released during the tape shock with insulation and without electrical insulation on the stability of the tape parameters was investigated. The obtained results indicate that as a result of thermal and dynamic processes occurring during the operation of the limiter, the tape parameters may be degraded and the value of the critical current may decrease.

Numerical analysis reveals that this error in total cost can be as high as 8% and that approximated operational models such as ED, ED+R or UC-C could provide sub-optimal solutions with inefficient capacity mix. Even though the impact of sub-optimal solutions is minor in the observed set of experiments, this could be problem specific.

The Vector Network Analyzer 16451B and the software Dielectric Probe 85070 manufactured by Agilent were used. Measurements were performed on the outer part of the fruit, on the shell and also on the inside, relating the results to the maturation index of the mango, identified by the yellowish tone in its shell, as well as the amount of soluble solids (amount of sugar). The results allowed to correlate the dielectric characteristics of the fruit with the physical-chemical transformations that occurred in the maturation process of the mango, as well as the sugar content. The lowest value was determined for the dielectric constant and for the tangent of losses on the day of the fruit's peak maturity.

The FBMC is referred as one of the strongest candidates to replace OFDM in 5G networks, but it is greatly affected by noise, inter-user interference, and distortion caused by the channel frequency selectivity in a MIMO channel. However, a phenomenon referred to as “self-equalization” occurs when the channel employs a larger ratio between the number M of base station (BS) antennas and the number K of users in Massive MIMO (MM), turning the effects of the channel frequency selectivity negligible. Under that condition, the FBMC presents better SE than OFDM mostly due to the absence of the cyclic prefix. Thus, by adopting a threshold in terms of the output mean squared error of the estimated transmitted symbols in MM, the results indicate the viability of FBMC, showing that although it requires a larger M/K ratio than OFDM to start working, after surpassing the threshold it presents a much higher SE which clearly justifies the extra number of BS antennas.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317570","5G;Massive MIMO;FBMC;OFDM","Frequency modulation;Spectral efficiency;OFDM;Transmitting antennas;Massive MIMO;Interference;Turning","5G mobile communication;antenna arrays;cellular radio;channel bank filters;distortion;equalisers;intercarrier interference;mean square error methods;MIMO communication;OFDM modulation","Filter Bank Multicarrier;FBMC;Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing;OFDM;single-cell environment;inter-user interference;MIMO channel;self-equalization;base station antennas;Massive MIMO;channel frequency selectivity;spectral efficiency analysis;massive multiple-input multiple-output system uplink;5G networks;distortion;BS antennas;output mean squared error","","","","11","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results of the long-term drift of an off-the-shelf device are presented and the time-constant associated to its drift is analyzed; the parameter that translates the dependence of the drift’s magnitude on the applied bias voltage is shown to be in contrast of well-established models of the drift phenomenon.

Reconfigurable interferometers, wide-band, and dual-band filters designed using interference principles are described in this overview paper.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317617","Generalitat de Catalunya; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317617","inteferometer;instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM);filter;microstrip devices","Microwave filters;Interferometers;Interference;Microwave theory and techniques;Transversal filters;Delay lines;Microwave measurement","band-pass filters;frequency measurement;frequency response;light interference;microwave filters;radiofrequency interference","microwave interference techniques;frequency measurement;microwave signal-interference techniques;input-signal components;different electrical paths;interference pattern;path lengths;interference-based power-transmission maximum;desired device frequency response;reconfigurable interferometers;dual-band filters;interference principles;overview paper","","","","7","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose and analyze a generalized link configuration, which in addition to incorporating heterodyne detection (HD) and remote heterodyne detection (RHD) links as particular cases, also includes a Dual-Drive MachZehnder Modulator (DD-MZM) combined with directional couplers (DC) with arbitrary division rates other than the usual 3 dB value. Relying on the Graf's theorem, an analytical formulation not limited to small-signal approximation was obtained which properly takes into account the nonlinearity of the modulation process at various operating bias points. The link RF frequency response is investigated with respect to the difference between the length of optical fiber travelled by the carrier and LO signals. Numerical simulations show that fading caused by optical fiber chromatic dispersion is strongly dependent on the DC directivity, fiber lengths and modulation formats, among others. Such dependence may be used to mitigate the known notch regions generated by the chromatic dispersion effect. The model developed for the studied link reveals RF gain enhancement with respect to link configuration in which LO and laser signal are in the same end. Furthermore, a link length as long as 100 km of notch-free regions for frequencies between 1 and 35 GHz is demonstrated. As far as we know those features had not been published yet.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317600","heterodyne;coherent detection;optical fiber;Graf’s theorem;chromatic dispersion","Radio frequency;Optical fiber communication;Optimized production technology;Optical mixing;Chromatic dispersion;Optical modulation;Modulation","frequency response;heterodyne detection;Mach-Zehnder interferometers;microwave photonics;optical fibre communication;optical fibre dispersion;optical links;optical modulation;radio-over-fibre","link length;fiber-optic link;heterodyne detection technique;wireless-over-fiber transmission systems;relative position;optical local oscillator;carrier source;generalized link configuration;Mach-Zehnder Modulator;directional couplers;arbitrary division rates;usual 3 dB value;small-signal approximation;modulation process;optical fiber chromatic dispersion;DC directivity;fiber lengths;modulation formats;chromatic dispersion effect;size 100.0 km;frequency 1.0 GHz to 35.0 GHz","","","","8","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Surprisingly, no regulations are currently in force which cover the RF transparency of buildings. It may well be justifiable on health and safety grounds (i.e. use of mobile phones or TETRA radio in emergency situations). For instance, there is substantial use of metal within current buildings which causes major problems for radio propagation. On the other hand, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is seen as a key technology and methodology to improve productivity and integration across various disciplines throughout the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) value chain. Although many valuable information has been added to such databases in the last years, detailed information about the radio wave propagation characteristics of buildings and building materials have been absent. This paper presents a multilayer Electromagnetic (EM) simulation tool to assess the radiofrequency transparency of building wall structures, which allows to explore different layer arrangements and determine the overall frequency response. In particular, the assessment of EM properties of different types of building walls commonly used in building construction, combined into one complete EM tool, is proposed. This is sought to be a valuable feature to be considered towards the integration with BIM-based simulation methods to provide unprecedented visualisation of the radio coverage within the building, allowing for the optimisation to meet specific facility radio requirements.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317674","Foundation for Science and Technology; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad; European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317674","Radiowave propagation;Channel modelling;BIM","Buildings;Tools;Building materials;Electromagnetics;Databases;Radio frequency;Wireless communication","building management systems;building materials;buildings (structures);database management systems;indoor radio;radiowave propagation;telecommunication computing;walls","RF transparency parameters;BIM databases;radio based services;radio propagation phenomena;indoor radio planning;human exposure assessment;electromagnetic radiation;safety grounds;mobile phones;TETRA radio;emergency situations;Building Information Modelling;radio wave propagation characteristics;building materials;multilayer electromagnetic simulation tool;radiofrequency transparency;building wall structures;building construction;complete EM tool;BIM-based simulation methods;radio coverage visualization;specific facility radio requirements;frequency response;architecture, engineering and construction value chain;AEC value chain","","","","6","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT gateways bridge devices to the Internet in the context of real-world applications. This paper presents a low cost IoT gateway prototype to bridge conventional Modbus RTU sensors/actuators to a MQTT IoT cloud. The methodology used consists in implementing bidirectional functional mappings between Modbus RTU and a MQTT broker. Two sets of events were defined in this mapping: one for Modbus alerts and other one for MQTT commands. The gateway prototype was validated in a scenario in which IoT Sensors generate events to update a monitor panel controlled by a CLP connected to the prototype. The results were promising since the integration allowed a transparent and efficient operation for the gateway in several different scenarios in the laboratory.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317637","IoT;Gateways;Modbus;MQTT protocol","Logic gates;Internet of Things;Protocols;Prototypes;Cloud computing;Bridges;Servers","actuators;Internet of Things;internetworking;network servers;protocols;sensors","MQTT broker;Modbus alerts;IoT Sensors;legacy automation processes;data-gathering devices;MQTT IoT cloud;bidirectional functional mappings;IoT gateway bridge devices;MQTT command integration;Modbus RTU sensor-actuator;CLP","","4","","5","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These beams are solutions to the Fresnel diffraction integral constructed from a Gaussianapodized Bessel beam. A comparison between finite series, 10-calized approximation (LA) and the time-consuming quadrature schemes are presented in terms of BSCs. It is shown that finite series and LA approaches agree with great precision.

The optical clip sensor can be operated in a wide range of frequencies. The sensitivity can be controlled by varying the stiffness of the clip. The static and dynamic characteristics of this sensor embedded in the carbon fiber were verified and presented through the finite element method and experimental tests were conducted.

Recently, a version of an Otto based device, baptized as Otto chip, was manufactured. Regression analysis procedures can be used to help the chip characterization by adjusting parameters of the model reflectance curve. However, as in any classical regression procedure, the initial guess must be close enough to the final solution to avoid convergence to a local minimum. An alternative approach to the classical regression procedure is the use of computational techniques inspired on swarms. Swarm intelligence, as this area of computer science is known, has successfully been used by engineers in various optimization problems. One prominent algorithm is the Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) that stands out for its low computational cost, simplicity of implementation and high efficiency on finding global optimum solutions. This paper describes the use of PSO in regression analysis of experimental SPR curves. It was shown that the PSO technique yields better results when compared with classical regression analysis methods.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317596","UPE; UFPE; CAPES; CNPq; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317596","particle swarm optimization;surface plasmon resonance;Otto chip;PSO;regression analysis","Particle swarm optimization;Regression analysis;Surface plasmons;Convergence;Semiconductor device measurement;Optimization;Optical sensors","particle swarm optimisation;regression analysis;surface plasmon resonance;swarm intelligence","swarm intelligence approach;surface plasmon resonance curves;Otto chip;Otto configuration;surface plasmon resonance sensors;underdeveloped research area;Otto based device;regression analysis procedures;chip characterization;model reflectance curve;classical regression procedure;computational techniques;computer science;particle swarm optimization;low computational cost;experimental SPR curves;classical regression analysis methods","","","","14","IEEE","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, SA also presented satisfactory results, being an interesting alternative method for designing high-order DRAs, specially considering its simpler implementation.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317571","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317571","High-order distributed Raman amplification;Particle Swarm optimization;Simulated Annealing;unrepeatered optical systems","Signal to noise ratio;Optical noise;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Simulated annealing;Stimulated emission;Optical pumping","optical pumping;particle swarm optimisation;Raman lasers;simulated annealing","simulated annealing;natural computing algorithms;third-order DRAs;PSO algorithm;interesting alternative method;high-order DRAs;Raman amplifiers;simulated annealing","","3","","6","IEEE","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prerequisite for such a simulated outcome is the adequate reflection of reality in the model. Moreover, field measurements are extremely resource-intensive for communication testing in rail transport. These two aspects lead to the fact that high quality channel models are essential in this industrial sector and the only way to obtain results regarding communication performance rapidly and without massive effort. After preliminary work has identified unexplored effects in train-onboard communication during tunnel crossing at high speeds, this work focuses on the creation of a channel model for such a scenario. By analyzing many channel impulse responses, it is the intention to gain an improved knowledge of interference effects and to transfer this scenario into a statistical channel model. After an appropriate verification, this enables the execution of several simulations in the context of 5G and the optimal setting of various communication parameters. A realistic evaluation is thus possible in a purely virtual way as finally presented by results of two applied channel models.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317549","channel sounding;channel model;5G;train communication","Channel models;Standards;Bandwidth;5G mobile communication;Mathematical model;Delays;Automobiles","5G mobile communication;modulation coding;radiofrequency interference;railway communication;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;transient response;wireless channels","rail transport;high quality channel models;communication performance;train-onboard communication;tunnel crossing;channel impulse responses;statistical channel model;communication parameters;high-speed rail traffic;communication testing;modulation-coding schemes;wireless onboard channel characterization;field measurements;industrial sector;interference effect","","1","","6","IEEE","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method allows the analysis of amplitude and frequency characteristics of an arbitrary waveform showing the correlation and, in this experiment, determine if it is possible to minimize the effect of the conducted emission by layout modification or if the differences are so small that a modification is not justified.

These materials have good transparency and conductivity. Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is a degenerate semiconductor material with high band gap, transparent in the visible range of the solar spectrum and belonging to TCO class. When nitrogen is added to the ITO thin film, it is formed a new semiconductor, ITON (or indium tin oxynitride). The properties and characteristics of this material depend on the nitrogen concentration that is incorporated in its structure. Characteristics such as band gap and resistivity differ if compared to ITO. ITON thin film also has a higher light response. In this work, Indium Tin Oxynitride films were fabricated by evaporation and PECVD techniques and electrical parameters were characterized. Incorporation of nitrogen into the film by plasma annealing with different temperatures (140 °C, 200 °C, 260 °C and 320 °C) could improve further the optical and electrical properties of the ITON films and thus making ITON film an ideal transparent and conducting material for opto-electronic applications. Substrates were silicon (75 mm, p-type, 1-10 ohm.cm) and optical three-inch glass wafers with 0.5 mm thickness. The thin films were analyzed with spectral response, IxV (current x voltage) and Hall effect analyses. The main objective of this study is the development of optoelectronic devices. The current versus voltage curve show the response of light. With the spectral response measures it is possible to verify that ITON based devices have higher quantum efficiency for the near infrared region. In conclusion, the ideal would be the application of these materials in sensors that operate in the infrared range.","","978-1-7281-3099-6","10.1109/IMOC43827.2019.9317577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317577","indium tin oxynitride;sensors;electrical characterization","Indium tin oxide;Sensors;Optical sensors;Optical films;Optical device fabrication;Nitrogen;Conductivity","annealing;electrical resistivity;energy gap;Hall effect;indium compounds;infrared detectors;infrared spectra;optical sensors;plasma CVD;plasma CVD coatings;semiconductor growth;semiconductor materials;semiconductor thin films;transparency;vacuum deposited coatings;vacuum deposition","degenerate semiconductor material;indium tin oxynitride thin films;ITON film;infrared sensor;transparent conductive oxides;wide band gap;electrical conductivity;transparency;PECVD;evaporation;plasma annealing;optical three-inch glass wafers;Hall effect;temperature 140.0 degC;temperature 200.0 degC;temperature 260.0 degC;size 0.5 mm;temperature 320 degC;InSnON","","","","13","IEEE","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, ETS-8, former generation of ETS-9, ended its operation as planned in 2017 and moved to a graveyard orbit. Wideband Inter Networking engineering test and Demonstration Satellite (WINDS) suddenly ended its operation due to a communication error in 2019 and it could not be maneuvered to a graveyard orbit. From the above, we should be aware of the rotation of the objects not only in graveyard orbits but also of objects in GEO to ensure the safety of the operation of ETS-9 and also telecom, earth observation, and navigation satellites. In this study, we carried out optical observations for some of nonoperational satellites including ETS-8 and WINDS using a CCD camera attached to a 1-m telescope. We will report how to select the nonoperational satellites, the results of the optical observations, and the light curves of the satellites using photometry.

The scale of these constellations requires a new approach to the design, build, and verification of high-performance space optics, one that will focus on mass-producibility, low-cost design, and limited touch-time. Honeywell and our partners have developed an optical intersatellite terminal that builds on our combined decades of experience in reliable space optics, electronics, and mass production of space hardware. The critical technical drivers of optical systems for space are their suscept­ibility to the thermal and radiation environments. The system is designed around Honeywell's Optical Pointing and Tracking Relay Assembly for Communications (OPTRAC), a low-cost sub­system which is designed to drive all of Honeywell's optical link products by providing a common interface between swappable front-end telescopes and back-end optical transceivers. The lowest-cost traditional approach to per­forming pointing and tracking is to apply quadrant photodiode sensors. These large-area devices have limited sensitivity and must maintain tight alignment tolerances over temperature. This chapter discusses the advantages and impacts of tracking with a pixelated sensor and presents results of laboratory testing and environmental qualification of a pixelated prototype subsystem.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384431","optical communications;detectors;satellite systems","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The systematic error calibration of an array feed is very important because the influence of phase errors appears prominently in the characteristics of the antennas. We propose a self-calibration system for an array feed using a pickup antenna and gating process to realize a more accurate systematic error calibration for array-fed reflector antennas. The calibration values for the array feed are obtained from the coupling characteristics using a pickup antenna from which the noise is removed by a gating process. This chapter shows the proposed method, procedure, and calibration results of the radiation pattern in an anechoic chamber. In order to determine the measurement parameters of the proposed method by parametric study, only the characteristics of the array feed were measured and evaluated. The calibration values, with gating a width of 0.01 ms, were almost the same compared with reference values. The calibrated radiation pattern using the proposed method was compared with a simulated radiation pattern, and the deviation in the H- and V-planes within a ± 6° range was about ±1.0 and ±0.6 dB, respectively. This chapter shows that the proposed self-calibration using a pickup antenna and gating process is effective for a DBF array feed.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384444","digital channelizer;digital beam-former;self-calibration method;systematic error;coupling characteristic;gating process","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Secret key agreement over FSO links (FSO-SKA) employs this security advantage for key establishment between two distant parties, which is secure against Eve even with unbounded computer resources. In this chapter, we numerically evaluate the performance of FSO-SKA for satellite laser communications under the given power constraint. We also compare the performance of FSO- SKA and quantum key distribution (QKD).

Most of the published work about this topic consider ideal oscillators, but in practice, the output of an oscillator is not a single spectral line at the nominal frequency. This chapter proposes a model for the oscillator phase noise and analyzes the resulting received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SNIR) in a satellite communication system using precoding. Simulations of a communication satellite system with a two-beam transponder and two receivers were performed to compute the effective SNIR. This work uses a simulator which also considers practical impairments such as time misalignment, errors in the channel state information, interference, thermal noise, and phase noise masks for satellite oscillators. The precoding methods used for the analysis are zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). The obtained results prove that there is a degradation in the performance due to the use of independent oscillators but this effect is compensated by the precoding matrix.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384465","phase noise;oscillator model;linear precoding;system performance","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

For a smooth integration of satellite networks into the terrestrial ones, the standardization bodies are pushing for shared spectrum. Therefore, it is of interest to study satellite specific scenarios, the applicability of multicarrier waveforms that have already shown promise to meet the requirements of the future mobile networks. 5G candidate waveforms such as filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (f-OFDM), filter bank multicarrier (FBMC), and universal filtered multi- carrier (UFMC) offer sharper out-of-band characteristics, significantly increasing the spectral efficiency. However, like OFDM, these waveforms exhibit a high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). A high PAPR saturates the nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA) which leads to nonlinear distortions in the on-board HPA's output. Moreover, signal clipping is often proposed in the literature to reduce the PAPR. However, clipping itself introduces nonlinear distortions within the signal bandwidth. Digital predistortion (DPD) can be applied to the clipped signal to remove the added nonlinear distortions while keeping the overall PAPR low. This chapter provides the simulation results on the application of the aforementioned waveforms to a satellite communication chain and presents the gains achieved by implementing DPD and clipping together in terms of PAPR, power spectral densities (PSDs), and bit error rates (BERs).","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384464","peak to average power ratio (PAPR);filtered-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (f-OFDM);filter bank multicarrier (FBMC);universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC);high power amplifier (HPA);digital predistortion (DPD);5G waveforms;satellite payloads","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Satellite communications systems are to play significant role in supporting this system in terms of significant capacity enhancement, in addition to its ability to serve area where the terrestrial infrastructure is unable to provide services. The DVB-S2 standards are the candidates that will support this quest. The extension of the second generation of the DVB-S2X has further justified this advantage by incorporating higher modulation and coding schemes (MODCODs) such as the 64-APSK, 128-APSK, and 256-APSK. However, with the increasing utilization of on-the-move applications and services, the classical limitations of the satellite links in a mobile environment pose a problem to the seamless realization of capacity. These problems include signal fading due to path blockage, multipath propagation, and shadowing. A realistic mobile satellite channel has been modeled in MATLAB¯ using realistic terrain data which is processed in Systems Tool Kits simulator (STK) in order to determine the satellite-receiver access time leading to the determination of the Markovian Transition Matrix used for channel state condition. The performance of a good selection of DVB-S2X MODCODs has been presented and the new mobile channel has been used to test the effect on mobility on system performance. The result indicated that the mobility of the earth station causes degradation to the link performance, with scenarios of higher values of Rician K-factor, denoting the dominance of line-of-sight (LOS) being the best. Therefore, the need for further highly efficient receiver processing and optimal thresholds switching techniques that can support mobile channels in terms of high data-rate and availability is more than a prerequisite for the satellite component of the 5G systems.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384457","land mobile satellite;DVB-S2X;Markov model;BER;channel modeling","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Interference is one of the major causes of service degradation and deficient operational efficiency. Moreover, the satellite spectrum is becoming more crowded, as more satellites are being launched for different applications. This increases the risk of interference, which causes anomalies in the received signal, and mandates the adoption of techniques that can enable the automatic and realtime detection of such anomalies as a first step toward interference mitigation and suppression. In this chapter, we present a machine learning (ML)-based approach which is able to guarantee a real-time and automatic detection of both short-term and long-term interference in the spectrum of the received signal at the base station. The proposed approach can localize the interference both in time and in frequency and is universally applicable across a discrete set of different signal spectra. We present experimental results obtained by applying our method to real spectrum data from the Swedish Space Corporation. We also compare our ML-based approach to a model-based approach applied to the same spectrum data and used as a realistic baseline.

Current communication platforms in place are not able to fully support the transmission of high priority safety critical data required to provide these services. Individually, the two main V2X architectures (DSRC and C-V2X) have limitations which inhibit them from fully supporting the V2X platform. As such, this chapter proposes the integration of 5G technology, which supports all types of communication technologies through the integration of reconfigurable devices and offers higher data rates and bandwidths than any preceding platform. The architecture proposed in the chapter is composed of three layers: DSR V2X for direct short-range communication; cellular V2X layer which will combine 5G cellular platform to provide backup communication when DSR V2X layer fails and multimedia capabilities; and satellite (SAT)-V2X which provides extra backhaul connectivity when both DSR and cellular V2X is unavailable.

Proceedings of the 37th International Communications Satellite Systems Conference (ICSSC-2019)","24 Mar 2021","2019","","","1","16","The commercial segment of the satellite communications industry has led the way in terms of innovation and investment. Beginning with the launch of Intelsat 1, Early Bird, in 1965, the size and coverage of satellites in general and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) systems in particular, have complemented and sometimes matched that of both fiber optic and wireless resources. The latest trend toward high-throughput satellites and non-GEO constellations assures that space is still vital to a variety of users who can depend on the robustness and bandwidth offered by satellite links. Perhaps we are at a point of inflection reminiscent of the 1980s when cables began to take over long-haul telecom demands, and again in the 1990s when satellite TV took front stage in terms of monetary gains and general knowledge of space broadcasting. The Internet exploded in the late 1990s to become a foundation for almost all forms of communication and even product marketing. Satellites responded with the very small aperture terminal that could deliver medium data rates, but cable modems and 3G wireless proved the master. Post-2000, satellite links came back by proving their effeteness in supporting remote locations to extend cellular systems, serve ships and aircraft, and aiding the success of our defense forces by reaching beyond line-of-sight. This brings us to the current day where our ability to use space is unparalleled, yet some doubt that satellites can be relevant and even retain an innovative posture as the world adopts 5G. To this, we can point to how the fundamentals cannot change as to the advantages of the space link and coverage of the planet, and of outer space for that matter. We discuss construction of space systems to apply low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and GEO, with advanced features to reach all people and places, providing them with information and critical support no matter their access to terrestrial wireless or fiber. We describe the processes needed to allow the space segment and satellite terminal devices to adapt to the user's situation, dependent on network connectivity and handoff performance. Ground facilities to access networks and resources will likewise arise from cloud technologies and intelligence to build infrastructure that can overcome prior disadvantages in remoteness and susceptibility to outage and other threats. This is the promise of the renewed commercial satellite communications segment, precisely because this is where innovators reside and where investment will always find a home.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384439","Post-2020 satellite communications;LEO;MEO;GEO systems;innovative communications satellite system advancements and applications","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this chapter, the beamforming capability of DBF with the configuration of an array-fed reflector is investigated. Antenna patterns are evaluated by considering the different restrictions on excitation coefficients between DBF and a conventional active phased array antenna (APAA). The excitation phase and amplitude of APAA is constrained to the assumed discretized values. The sidelobe levels formed by DBF achieve an excellent performance of more than 5 dB compared to APAA.

The authors have investigated the MIMO channels in LEO satellites, specifically proposing a channel model and assuming line-of-sight (LOS) environments. In the previous study, the authors analyzed channel capacity by using a channel model that randomly defines the satellite position. However, channel capacity that considers the parameters of the antenna position due to the satellite attitude must be analyzed. The authors evaluated the channel capacity on the LEO-MIMO channel model by using the transmitting antenna distance and satellite altitude as parameters. As a result, the authors found that the channel capacity of an LEO-MIMO satellite varies at different time interval, and this time interval depends on the antenna distance and the altitude.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384474","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);LEO satellite;channel capacity","","","","","1","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

For commercial application, the downlink from low Earth orbit (LEO) sensors and observation satellites is of a special interest. Such satellites should be capable of recording gigabytes of data and transferring it to the ground stations within a few minutes since the satellite is only visible for a short time at such low altitudes. This implies a very fast and reliable information processing at the terminal. For this, it would be beneficial to utilize the entire 1500 MHz spectrum of the extended Ka-band. In this context, the design of the modem architecture is very challenging. This problem is addressed in this chapter for the first time. We develop a new terminal modem architecture, which is expected to support a data rate in the range between 25 Msps and 1400 Msps. Through this, the receiver can easily adapt to changes in the data rate according to the traffic requirements. Furthermore, a simulator tool is developed, which is used for a numerical performance evaluation of the individual components and the whole system.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384424","wideband modem;high throughput satellite;MODCOD;equalisation;synchronisation","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The system involves three key participants: JAXA ground station at Uchinoura, the Deep Space Network (DSN) components at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California, and the Artemis 1 mission navigation at the NASA Johnson Space Center, Texas. Demonstration of Uchinoura station support to the future Artemis signal relies on the use of a low-cost, highly-portable software-defined radio (SDR) test equipment as well as the tracking of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft. Using the SDR equipment, we validated the compatibility of signal format between the Artemis flight radio and the Uchinoura ground station without having to send the flight equipment to the station. By tracking an ongoing operational spacecraft such as LRO, we were able to calibrate the performance of the system in real operational conditions. The measured Doppler noise of 0.03 Hz (1-sigma), or 0.002 m/s range rate at S-band, for Uchinoura station is deemed suitable to the Artemis 1 mission navigation needs. This chapter also discusses the test equipment capability and its performance. In addition to being low cost, the equipment offers many advantages compared to the traditional full-scaled test signal simulator. Chief among them is portability making system easy to set up and transport, and the fidelity of the test signal that it captures from spacecraft flight equipment. Some of the lessons learned, such as internal frequency stability of the test signal, are also reflected.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384427","EM-1;Uchinoura;DSN;three-way;Doppler","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Specifically with respect to high throughput satellites (HTS) where the amount of information passed through the transponders, that is, capacity, is determined mainly by the quantity of beams the satellite can generate. This application is well suited for SSPAs over the conventional TWTA solution as they are smaller and lighter weight enabling a simplification of HTS payload architectures, higher density physical integration, and the ability to support active array transmit solutions all of which increases the quantity of beams and thus capacity. However, this is also dependent on the SSPA's DC power and thermal dissipation as these are limited by a satellite's ability to generate the DC power and remove the thermal energy created by these types of units. Gallium nitride (GaN) power amplifiers (PAs) have shown the ability to generate high RF output power levels with small size and high efficiency thereby enabling step-function improvement in capacity for our emerging generation of HTS [1]. For this effort, K-band power amplifier breadboards were designed, fabricated, and tested. The purpose of the breadboards was to validate the baseline approach to meet the challenging performance required for HTS. These requirements were based on the need to increase satellite capacity. Maxar Space Infrastructure leads the industry in launched HTS capacity, with SSL having built some of the world's highest capacity spacecraft, with initial HTS systems of 50 GBps, innovating 100 GBps class, then to 200 GBps class, and now over 500 GBps class solutions [2]. This trend of nearly doubling the throughput capacity with each innovated new generation continues to project forward with the need for higher capacity solutions. This chapter will describe the design and performance of the GaN PA breadboards. Measurements of three key parameters—RF power out (Pout), power added efficiency (PAE), and carrier to third order intermodulation level (C/3IM) and/or noise power ratio (NPR)—will be presented to describe the performance of the PA. Additionally, a description of the GaN PA MMICs and the module integration approaches utilized will be given. To the author’s best knowledge, the results presented are the best reported for a GaN PA module in this frequency band.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384437","solid state power amplifier (SSPA);monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC);gallium nitride (GaN);traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA);Ka-band;high throughput satellite (HTS)","","","","","","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Japan should vitalize the ocean industries since we have a huge area of the territorial sea and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (the sixth biggest country in the world). To vitalize them significant cost reduction of works in/on the sea will be necessary. It will be achieved by automation or unmanned work in a harsh environment. The utilization of autonomous marine robots is an effective unmanned way to achieve this cost reduction. It would be better that the robots autonomously deal with dynamic change of environment and are remotely controlled by operators for mission execution.

Most of the existing trunking satellite systems are optimized (in terms of resources, processing, and architectures) for the GEO consolidated architecture. This system design vastly differs from the envisaged LEO system due to the motion of the satellite and limited coverage. This chapter considers the development of a tool to optimize the resources, processing, and architectures for next-generation LEO systems to meet the increasing requirements from trunking markets. The developed optimization tool jointly optimizes the number of beams, beam width, power, and bandwidth allocation in order to match the provided data rate to the predicted traffic demand. Due to the generic nature of the proposed method, further system parameters, such as orbit parameters, number of satellites, or frequency reuse factor, can be easily added to the list of optimization parameters.

The present state of the effort, future work, and other elements of the work to date are described in this chapter. This implementation is intended to support applications that run at 1+ Gbps per the requirements of modern optical and high-frequency radio frequency links. Uniquely, this implementation is also tuned to support relay and data trunking applications, which might require support for large num­bers of small bundles per second. The design for this platform is based entirely on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and possesses buffering capabilities in the 5 TB range. This document takes results from previous individual tests and integrates them to demonstrate results in the presence of a coherent use-case, for example, consider a network aboard the International Space Station which intends to utilize an upcoming optical communications capability. For this use-case, orbital analysis software is used to analyze orbital dynamics, from which a list of access times are generated that might take in to account weather, schedule competition, etc. A variant of contact graph routing (CGR) is applied to these windows to determine an optimal schedule. This schedule is then loaded into the HDTN prototype and, in conjunction with various measurement tools, a complete end-to-end analysis of HDTN's performance is conducted. Various bottlenecks (including storage) are identified: these bottlenecks are expected to help us focus our future work on the elements of the system that are most likely to present issues moving forward. Finally, we discuss possible paths for evolution beyond the present rates supported by the system, including (but not limited to) hardware acceleration.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384420","delay-tolerant networking;optical communication","","","","","2","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To improve this situation, the recent discussions held by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Japan have concluded that large aperture reflector antennas for Ka-band are one of the key technologies to realize for the next generation of geostationary communications satellites. To this end, JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, started to investigate the realization of 5 m aperture large deployable reflector of Ku/Ka-band for geostationary communication satellites. The reflector is a fan-fold deployable reflector and composed of a fan-fold deployable structure, a thin-plate network, and a metal mesh. The fan-fold deployable structure is designed as a Japanese fan, or ""sensu,"" and can be stowed in the manner of a folded fan. A rhombus lattice thin-plate network forms the parabolic surface.

The influence of shadowing is dependent on the seasons, as the conditions of the leaves vary by season for different types of trees.

To overcome this drawback, a model of an array antenna including the mutual coupling between antenna elements has been constructed.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has traditionally launched single spacecraft missions that are served by the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) pro­gram. Operations on SCaN networks are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and often each asset serves a single user spacecraft at a time. Recent movement towards swarm missions could make the current approach unsustainable. Additionally, the integration of commercial communication service providers will substantially increase the data transfer options avail­able to new missions. NASA science missions have found benefit in launching swarms of space­craft, allowing coordinated simultaneous observations from different per­spectives. Inter-spacecraft communication (mesh networking) is an enabler for this architecture, as are CubeSats that allow cost-effective provisioning of distributed mission assets. As more complex swarm missions launch, one challenge is coordinating communication within the swarm and choosing the appropriate mechanism for telemetry, tracking, control, and data services to and from Earth. Cognitive communications research conducted by SCaN aims to mitigate the increasing communication complexity for mission users by increasing the autonomy of links, networks, and service scheduling. By considering automation techniques including recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, cognitive algorithms and related approaches enable increased mission science return, improved resource utilization for service provider networks, and resiliency in unpredictable or unplanned environments. The Cognitive Communications Project at the NASA Glenn Research Center develops applications of data-driven, nondeterministic methods to improve the autonomy of space communication. The project emphasizes the development of decentralized space networks with artificial intelligence agents optimizing communication link throughput, data routing, and system-wide asset management. This chapter discusses the objectives, approaches, and opportunities of the research to address growing needs of the space communications community.","","978-1-83953-499-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384426","cognitive;autonomy;delay-tolerant networking","","","","","1","","","","24 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Typically, the performance of air interfaces is measured in terms of throughput, transmit error performances, etc. However, we evaluate for energy efficiency, an additional hardware-related aspect, which indicates the joint energy efficiency of hardware and transmission scheme. In particular, conventional continuous transmission of a message is opposed to discontinuous transmission by telegram splitting, as specified for the telegram splitting ultra-narrowband (TS-UNB) technology standardized by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

To this must be added the fact that the geographic valley of the Cauca River (VRC) produces almost 80% of Colombia's sugar cane, and that pre-harvest burning is still used in 34% of the harvested area. This research is part of the CACIQUE project and measurement campaign (CAuca river valley sugarCane pre-harvest burning aIr QUality Effects), which seeks to quantify and attribute sources of pollution to the air quality measured in Palmira, center of the VRC. In this extended summary we report measurements of aerosols, in situ in the surface layer, and of the atmospheric column by solar photometry at the Palmira Headquarters of the National University of Colombia (3,512 N, 76,308 W). Instrumentation included a beta analyzer and high and low volume PM2.5 and PM10 samplers, a cascade impactor for particle size mass distribution, and a nephelometer. Solar photometry measurements show that the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 500 nm measured in Palmira (~ 0.22) is almost ~ 2 higher than in Bogotá (~ 0.14), and only marginally lower than that measured in the Carboniferous Zone of the Cesar (~ 0.28). Even more unexpected is the fact that this high AOT appears inconsistent with the comparatively low concentrations measured at the surface. Angstrom exponents, derived from photometric measurements, are in the range 0.2-2, which is indicative of a mixture of 1) predominantly fine particulate matter, which would include secondary aerosols (as revealed by our analysis of PM2.5), and soot from biomass burning, and 2) coarse material, including dust. In general, more than three quarters of the attenuation by aerosols in the atmospheric column is attributable to fine material. The mean volumetric particle size distributions in the atmospheric column were comparable to the mass distributions in the surface layer, with modal diameters of ~ 0.3 μm and ~ 6 μm in the column, and ~ 0.9 μm and ~ 5.2 μm in the column. surface layer.","","978-1-7281-5129-8","10.1109/CASAP48673.2019.9364032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364032","Valle del Cauca;aerosols;optical thickness;AOT;Angstrom exponent;particle size distribution","Pollution measurement;Gases;Aerosols;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Rivers;Photometry","aerosols;air pollution;air quality;atmospheric composition;atmospheric optics;dust;particle size","geographic valley;VRC;Colombia's sugar cane;harvested area;measurement campaign;CAuca river valley sugarCane pre-harvest burning aIr QUality Effects;surface layer;atmospheric column;Palmira Headquarters;National University;particle size mass distribution;solar photometry measurements;aerosol optical thickness;high AOT;comparatively low concentrations;photometric measurements;secondary aerosols;biomass burning;mean volumetric particle size distributions;low volume PM2.5;PM10 samplers;Bogotá;Cesar;CACIQUE project;greenhouse gases;industrial emissions;national industry;Valle del Cauca;high optical thickness","","","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this project, three low-cost Clarity sensors were evaluated, co-located in reference stations of the Bogotá monitoring network (Usaquén, Ferias and Kennedy). The measurements of four and two months of the sensors and the reference equipment for PM2.5, in time-time resolution, were compared to evaluate aspects such as response linearity, dependence on relative humidity and temperature and improvement of the sensor's accuracy (calibration), with a multiple linear regression model. Two scenarios were proposed: 1. Calibration with two-month data and application of the calibration equation to the following two months. 2. Calibration with data from four months and application of the calibration equation to the same period. For the calibration period with two-month data, the R2 values before and after calibration were very low: 0.23, 0.32 at Kennedy; 0.41, 0.44 in Fairs and 0.40, 0.44 in Usaquén. ii) For the four-month calibration period, the results showed improvements as follows: 0.33, 0.41 in Kennedy; 0.54, 0.57 in Fairs and 0.55 to 0.59 in Usaquén. These correlations are lower than those found in similar published comparisons. Inexpensive sensors can be used to make indicative assessments of air quality, but they do not produce highly accurate results. Also, to install community information networks. Since the sensors depend on a Wi-Fi connection to upload the records to the Clarity server, information loss occurs when the connection is lost due to power outages or energy-saving practices in the institutions or communities where the sensors are installed. Therefore, it is recommended to use systems that allow on-site storage of records during interruptions of the Wi-Fi connection or internet service.","","978-1-7281-5129-8","10.1109/CASAP48673.2019.9364031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364031","Air Pollution;Air Quality Monitoring;Low Cost Sensors","Sensors;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Calibration;Temperature sensors;Atmospheric modeling;Wireless fidelity","air pollution;air quality;calibration;Internet;regression analysis;sensors;wireless LAN","Bogotá air quality monitoring network;public policy decisions;low-cost Clarity sensors;reference stations;Kennedy;reference equipment;time-time resolution;multiple linear regression model;calibration equation;Usaquén;calibration period;community information networks;PM2.5;R2 values;on-site storage;Wi-Fi connection;internet service","","","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, the lack of studies in the Colombian territory is worrying, even more so when it does not have control mechanisms due to null legislation on environmental emissions for these sources. Given this absence, this work seeks to generate quantitative information through the estimation of emissions of: SO2, NOx, Particulate Material (PM10, PM2.5), Hydrocarbons (HC), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), CO, CO2, CH4, and N2O, using the “Bottom up” methodology for Container, Bulk and General Cargo vessels arriving at the Barranquilla Fluvial Terminal throughout the year 2018, in order to make a preliminary diagnosis of the current situation of the port.

As an indirect result of the Peace Process, deforestation in Colombia has been growing alarmingly: in 2017 (220 thousand hectares) it was 23% higher than in 2016. Total forest coverage has decreased from 57% in 1990 to 52% in 2017. It is estimated that 27% (69Mton of CO2 equivalent) of national greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 were caused by deforestation. In this case, the activity, that is, the deforested area, is the controlling factor for the uncertainty in the emission estimate. The thematic accuracy assessment is a necessary input for the estimation of central values and confidence intervals for the activity data. This research has sought to improve the estimation of the confidence intervals and reduce the standard errors. For this, three different approaches to statistical inferences have been developed that are used as a generalization tool that from the data of a sample can produce estimates of the population parameters, which are: probability sampling (based on the design), mathematical models (model-based) or a mixture of the two above known as hybrid inference. Our approach includes the design-based approach, analyzing different scenarios of sampling design, response and estimation of statistical parameters. This study estimates the thematic error associated with deforestation in a region of the PNN (Natural National Park) Sierra de la Macarena.

To explore the association between atmospheric pollutants and variations in the frequency of occurrence of health events, it is convenient to have complete atmospheric pollutants data, in order to avoid introducing biases into the results. A useful strategy for obtaining complete time series is the application of missing data imputation methods. In this work, we compare the performance of two imputation techniques in particulate matter data: Multiple Imputation and Neural Networks. Data from two stations of the Air Quality Monitoring Network of the Aburrá Valley, Antioquia were used. In general, the applied techniques presented a good fit, where the results observed when applying each method in situations of presence or absence of meteorological data (or predictor variables) were differential. In situations where there is no access to predictor variables and there are percentages of missing data greater than 25%, the Neural Networks technique showed a better performance. The presence of missing values in the predictor variables, used in the Multiple Imputation method, limited the technique's performance.","","978-1-7281-5129-8","10.1109/CASAP48673.2019.9364069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364069","Atmospheric pollutants;data mining;imputation;neural networks","Time series analysis;Monitoring;Media;Conferences;Licenses;Internet;Artificial neural networks","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These substances are produced mainly by combustion processes, which can be significant on high-traffic roads. The Aburrá Valley is declared an atmospheric basin contaminated by particulate matter as a consequence of topographic, meteorological, climatic, demographic and anthropogenic factors. Pollution peaks coincide with the hours of greatest displacement of the population In this context, the spatial evaluation of the PAH concentrations associated with particulate matter was proposed by means of a photoelectric aerosol sensor during short trips (<; 2 hours) in periods of high traffic flow (between 7:00 and 9:00 hrs.) from Medellín to Girardota (T1) and Caldas (T2) in an electric car equipped with a continuous PM2.5 particle analyzer and a global positioning system (GPS). The average PAH concentrations obtained were 742.6 and 698.2 ng.m-3 during T1 and T2, respectively, in contrast to the average 70.5 ng.m-3 measured within the municipal capital of Girardota. The concentrations of PAH and PM2.5 had the same trend, and significant correlations (r> 0.5) were established between them. Some areas of high PAH concentration that could be attributed to vehicular dynamics were identified through a geographic information system. The results show that road users under these high traffic flow conditions would be exposed to an average inhalation dose of PAH greater than 0.12 μg. Kg-1. day which reveals the need to implement immediate management tools for the monitoring of these substances.","","978-1-7281-5129-8","10.1109/CASAP48673.2019.9364044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364044","Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons;aerosol photoelectric sensor;PAS 2000;routes;vehicular flow","Monitoring;Europe;Roads;Hydrocarbons;Aerosols;Silicon;Instruments","aerosols;air pollution;atmospheric chemistry;atmospheric composition;atmospheric optics;geographic information systems;organic compounds;road traffic","topographic factors;Medellín to Girardota;Caldas;atmospheric basin;high-traffic roads;combustion processes;risk factor;respirable particulate matter;Aburrá Valley metropolitan area;high traffic flow roads;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons;high traffic flow conditions;road users;high PAH concentration;average PAH concentrations;global positioning system;PM2.5 particle analyzer;Girardota;photoelectric aerosol sensor;spatial evaluation;pollution peaks;anthropogenic factors;demographic factors;climatic factors;meteorological factors","","","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results obtained in the predecessor research carried out at the Antonio Nariño University on the pre-feasibility of wind and solar systems for residential self-sufficiency are evaluated under the implication of the new incentives included in Law 1715 of 2014. The results of said study show that the wind system is unable to obtain a payback period for the investment, even considering the application of the new legal incentives, while the solar photovoltaic system can pay off within the established useful life horizon; when applying the incentives of Law 1715 (Value added tax and customs taxes excluded); The work concludes that it is possible to obtain a payback period of the system between 10.6 and 12.9 years, depending on the socioeconomic strata where it is implemented [1], however, according to the economic evaluation criteria and the variability of the Market conditions, this range of the payback period, as well as other profitability indicators can vary significantly. Additionally, the research methodology currently being carried out between the Universidad de La Salle and the Universidad Antonio Nariño entitled ""Renewable energy use strategies focused on urban planning and environmental conditions of housing in Colombia"" is partially synthesized.

A characterization campaign was carried out at a traffic station between 11/23/2018 and 02/16/2019, locating two low-volume meters at Polytechnic traffic monitoring network station under protocols accredited by IDEAM and International Laboratories. The samples were analyzed for elemental, ionic and carbonaceous composition, applying methods (ICP-MS), chromatography and NIOSH 5040 protocol. For the comparison of the changes in the chemical composition of PM2.5, concentration and speciation historical reports for periods of diesel consumption of 25 and 50 ppm of sulfur (S) were analyzed. An analysis of the concentration distribution between march 2008 and february 2019 shows an average decrease of 4.8 (μg / m3) and 5.1 (μg / m3) for 75% of the data. Based on the results of the characterization and previous studies, a greater adjustment of the ionic balance in the composition of the samples in the 2019 campaign was evaluated, showing the effect of the reduction of sulfates of 1.4% in the PM2.5 mass as an impact of the fuel quality improvement and a 2.2% EC reduction associated with the optimization of combustion systems in furnaces and boilers, renewal of the vehicle fleet in public transport and implementation of mobility and sustainable strategies in the metropolitan area. For the first time in the region, a concentration of the potassium ion (K +) is detected, which may be associated with the increase in the consumption of biodiesel in the region. The significant increase in the OC / EC ratio in the period of consumption of lower sulfur diesel (S) and some strong correlations such as that found between SO42– and NH4 +, infer a greater atmospheric reactivity implying the formation of secondary PM2.5 and consequently, a high need to continue with strategies to control primary emissions from all combustion sources.","","978-1-7281-5129-8","10.1109/CASAP48673.2019.9364055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364055","PM2.5;Characterization;Fuel Improvement;Desulfurization","Sulfur;Protocols;Iron;Combustion;Climate change;Urban areas","aerosols;air pollution;air quality;atmospheric composition;biofuel;chromatography;public transport","public transport;biodiesel;Colombia;boilers;furnaces;combustion systems;NIOSH 5040 protocol;chromatography;IDEAM;AD 2015 to 2019;PM2.5;United Nations-International Atomic Energy Agency;chemical composition;ICP-MS;carbonaceous composition;ionic composition;International Laboratories;Polytechnic traffic monitoring network station;traffic station;PIGECA Air Quality Management Plan;Área Metropolitana del Valle de Aburrá;Ecopetrol;climate change;sulfur diesel;metropolitan area;fuel quality;diesel consumption","","","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring of different daily activities was analyzed and it was found that cooking, sweeping and sanitizing (use of disinfectant or bactericidal sprays) significantly raise the concentrations of pollutants in the air and despite the fact that they depend on many factors, there are evident patterns of behavior between activities and indoor air quality. For each behavior pattern, the stages were identified (with respect to the Air Quality Index criteria) and average periods were obtained. The monitoring showed that the concentrations increase in the first minutes when the source is activated, reaching maximum values of up to 6 times the background concentration of PM2.5 in cooking, 4 times the background concentration of PM10 when sweeping, and with times average return of 54 and 30 min respectively, while formaldehyde exceeds the limits accepted by international environmental agencies and causing potential risk under no-ventilation conditions.

In this first phase of the project, a spatial and temporal analysis of the behavior of PM10 and PM2.5 and the relationship between these two fractions was developed. Additionally, meteorological data were recorded in the sampling stations, which allowed the analysis of the origin of the pollutants and included relevant atypical events, such as the alerts for air pollution, day without car and environmental vehicular restriction measures. In general, higher concentrations of PM are observed in the southern and western areas of the city, with PM2.5/PM10 ratios close to unity, which may indicate a considerable contribution of fine material from combustion activities. In certain periods of time, this ratio decreases to 0.5, which could also suggest a contribution of resuspension activities, especially to the gross fraction PM10. During the first months of 2019, concentrations were observed above the permitted levels, in some cases throughout the urban perimeter, which could infer regional pollution phenomena such as biomass burning and marine aerosoltransported over long distances. In the second phase of the project, we will have the chemical characterization of the PM, which will allow the confirmation of hypotheses about the origin of the particulate material in Bogota, especially in the most affected areas of the south-west and in the periods of environmental contingency.

Methodology: the literature review was conducted in ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, Springer and Scopus databases between the years 1990-2017. The order of importance for the FFs was established by a citation frequency index (Q). The conditioning FFs identified were as follows: dust road particle size (Q1 =3D 0.842), vehicle traffic (Q2 =3D 0.742) and traffic composition (Q2 =3D 0.630). Results: the results showed that on urban roads there were potential resuspension particles between <; 0.25-10 μm and its main sources of emission in order of importance were as follows: deposited road sediment (18.8%), tyre wear (2.5%), brake wear (2.5%) and pavement wear (1.30%). A linear relationship (R2 = 3D 0.531) was identified between vehicle traffic density (veh./h) and PM10 concentration (μg/m3). Regarding the traffic composition, on average, the highest emission factors for RPM were associated with heavy-duty vehicles (1016 mg/VKT) in relation to light-duty vehicles (53.4 mg/VKT) and motorcycles (3.95 mg/VKT). Finally, this review showed that Europe, Asia and North America registered the highest amount of studies on PMR (92.2%) while in Latin America these were scarce (7.80%).","","978-1-7281-5129-8","10.1109/CASAP48673.2019.9364049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364049","Particulate Matter;Resuspension;Traffic intensity;Air quality","Roads;Sediments;Meteorology;Indexes;Atmospheric modeling;Water pollution;Urban areas","air pollution;brakes;dust;road vehicles;sediments;tyres;wear","light-duty vehicles;heavy-duty vehicles;emission factors;vehicle traffic density;road sediment;urban roads;traffic composition;dust road particle size;citation frequency index;Scopus databases;urban air quality;road environments;RPM;physical factors conditioning;urban areas;resuspended particulate matter;air pollution","","","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These air pollutants can be accurately measured using ground, mass-based devices. However, the limited availability and spatial coverage of ground-monitoring networks restrict their use for the analysis of pollution at local and regional scales. The use of ground-based measurements combined with satellite and reanalysis models data is an excellent tool to analyze air pollution events on a regional scale. In this study, a Neural Network Model (NN) that relates Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and meteorological variables from the MERRA-2-reanalysis model was developed for the estimation and mapping of PM2.5 concentration distribution in Northeastern Mexico. The NN was calibrated using ground-based PM2.5 concentrations from the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA), the main urban area in the region, for a period covering 2010 to 2014. AOD, temperature, and relative humidity, along PM2.5 components (dust, sea salt, black carbon, organic carbon, and sulfate) from MERRA-2 reanalysis model were found to be factors that significantly influence the regional distribution of PM2.5. Monthly-averaged PM2.5 concentrations were mapped, with maximum levels located over the MMA. The largest PM2.5 concentrations occurred in winter and spring, while moderate concentrations were observed in autumn and low concentration in summer. In conclusion, MERRA-2 reanalysis data can be used to study atmospheric pollution distribution at regional and local scales. The magnitude of PM2.5 pollution events of PM2.5 varies in space and time, showing large seasonality and heterogeneous distribution across the region. The methodology developed and results obtained here can be used to improve air quality management in places with few or no ground-based measurements.","","978-1-7281-5129-8","10.1109/CASAP48673.2019.9364066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364066","PM 2.5;MERRA-2;neural network;reanalysis model","Monitoring;Atmospheric modeling;Biomedical monitoring;Aerosols;Atmospheric measurements;Analytical models;Sea measurements","aerodynamics;aerosols;air pollution;air quality;atmospheric composition;atmospheric optics","Aerosol Optical Depth;atmospheric pollution distribution;ground-based PM2.5;MERRA-2 reanalysis model;PM2.5 concentration distribution;MERRA-2-reanalysis model;meteorological variables;Neural Network Model;regional scale;air pollution events;reanalysis models data;ground-monitoring networks;MERRA-2 re-analysis model;PM2.5 regional distribution;influential variables;ground-based measurements;PM2.5 pollution events;local scales;regional scales;MERRA-2 reanalysis data;Monthly-averaged PM2","","","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The net reduction of these emissions and greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, CH4, and N2O, is a more complex and controversial issue, since it involves the entire production chain, including agricultural emissions, about which he knows very little. Similar volumes of oil palm biodiesel are produced in Colombia (1261 ton / day in 2017) and sugar cane bioethanol (1005 m3 / day in 2017). The geographic valley of the Cauca River (VRC), in which it is possible to grow cane throughout the year, produces almost 80% of Colombia's sugar cane. The pre-harvest burning of sugarcane (QPA) is still a common practice, given its advantages in terms of yield and production, compared with the green harvest, that is, without pre-harvest burning. Despite its importance, very little is yet known about the impact on air pollution of this practice. This research is part of the CACIQUE project and measurement campaign (CAuca river valley sugarCane pre-harvest burning aIr QUality Effects), which seeks to quantify and attribute sources to the air quality measured in the center of the VRC. Based on detailed information for 2018, in this presentation we will present a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of the QPA in the VRC, and a first estimate of the associated atmospheric emissions. In 2018, 66% of the area was harvested green, 26% by controlled burning, and 8% by fires, or unintentional burning. The analysis also revealed that the majority of the burns take place in the 4-8 pm period, and a considerable reduction in burns and fires in the rainiest months (May and November).

However, current sEMG-based speech recognition approaches usually depend on the electrodes chosen by experience, and whether electrodes of both left and right side should be chosen remains unclear. In this study, high-density (HD) sEMG signals were symmetrically recorded from 120 electrodes placed on both sides of the facial and neck muscles across eight normal-speaking subjects, when they were speaking five Chinese and English words, respectively. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier were applied on four time-domain features extracted from the HD sEMG signals for speech classification. The results showed that classification accuracies in speech recognition could be larger than 85% in average, and using information from the left side of the neck muscles had no significant difference from using the right side. Meanwhile, the individual difference played an import role in the left/right contributions of the facial muscles. The pilot study suggests that the left/right contributions of the articulatory muscles should be different between the neck and face, which might provide useful clue to reduce the electrode number and to select the best location of channels for speech recognition.","","978-1-83953-443-0","10.1049/cp.2019.1197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307491","HIGH-DENSITY SEMG;SPEECH RECOGNITION;SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE","Neck;Muscles;Face recognition;Speech recognition;Electrodes;Facial muscles;Task analysis","","","","","","","","4 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Therefore, we extracted synergies from three structures of electromyogram (EMG) using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Algorithm (NNMF), including single-trial EMGs (SIN), average (AVE) and concatenation of all-trial EMGs (CON). Results indicated the significant impact of data structures on synergy numbers. Further, we also calculated the reconstruction effect of EMGs across trials to examine ability of the three structures to capture trial-based features. It suggested that synergies extracted by SIN captured more features of the original trial than other trials, and CON and AVE could both invariably and adequately reconstruct EMGs of four trials but with higher extent of CON than AVE. These results were beneficial in guiding synergy-based researches in rehabilitation assessment and control to deal with EMGs of multiple trials.","","978-1-83953-443-0","10.1049/cp.2019.1194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307488","DATA STRUCTURE;MUSCLE SYNERGIES;RECONSTRUCTION EFFECT;THE NUMBER OF SYNERGIES","Electromyography;Muscles;Data structures;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Data mining;Analysis of variance","","","","","","","","4 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The results showed that the interaction strength on stroke-affected hand was weaker in comparison with that on the unaffected hand and healthy controls. There, however, were no significant differences between two directions for stroke patients, while the FCMC in descending pathway was dominant at high beta-band (25–35Hz) than that in ascending direction for healthy controls. These differences might derive from the structural lesion which may disorder the function of oscillation, coordination, feedback and transmission between the efferent control and the afferent feedback.

In this work, a non-invasive muscle oxygenation monitoring technique, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to acquire concentration of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2) and total-hemoglobin (tHb) in four hemiparesis patients. The participants were divided into two groups. Participants who can clench their paretic side of fist were attributed to mild group and asked to perform clenching tasks using their non-paretic or paretic hand alternatively. Participants who cannot clench their paretic side of fist were attributed to severe group and asked to only perform clenching tasks using their non-paretic hand. The analysis of muscle oxygenation variation showed that the HbO2 and tHb decreased on the contracted side while no significant HbO2 and tHb changes were observed on the non-contracted side at mild group. For severe group, the HbO2 contraction of the paretic side was observed to decrease when performing non-paretic fist clenching. These results indicated that the muscle oxygen variation at the paretic side was different due to the severity of hemiparesis and it may be a potential assessment for hemiparesis.","","978-1-83953-443-0","10.1049/cp.2019.1204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307498","HEMIPARESIS;MUSCLE OXYGENATION;NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY;NIRS","","","","","","","","","4 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Unfortunately, the control performance of myoelectric prostheses is commonly affected by a number of factors that limit their practical use. When most of the factors have been investigated in the previous studies, it remains unclear how muscle fatigue negatively affects the prosthetic control stability. In this pilot work, our goal was to study the muscle fatigue that was induced by wearing a prosthesis with different weights. The effect of the weight of the prosthesis on muscle fatigue was estimated by surface electromyography (sEMG) signals that were recorded from residual limb muscles of a transradial amputee before and after wearing the prostheses. Three features, mean absolute value (MAV), mean frequency (MNF) and median frequency (MDF), were extracted from the EMG recordings and then the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was represented by the MAV and the muscle fatigue tendency was estimated from the MDF and MNF. The preliminary results of the study indicated that the greater the weight of the prostheses, the more likely it was to cause muscle fatigue. Importantly, our results showed that the muscles of intact limb recover much quicker than the disabled side from muscle fatigue. This study could provide the guidance for amputees to select a proper prosthesis base on individual load capacity, and decide appropriate usage time in daily training activities.","","978-1-83953-443-0","10.1049/cp.2019.1203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307497","MUSCLE FATIGUE;EMG;PROSTHETIC WEIGHT","Fatigue;Muscles;Prosthetics;Electromyography;Sockets;Force;Feature extraction","","","","","","","","4 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The training system is developed by 3ds Max and Unity3D, containing three different functions named as Self-Control Therapy, Aversion Therapy and Drug Craving Assessment. In Self-Control Therapy, a 3-D racing game designed for promoting the concentration of drug addicts is the key idea of the system, which achieves a real-time control through BCI technology. The communication function of the system is accomplished via UDP. The ultimate target for this system is to help drug addicts to improve their ability of self-control by repeated trainings. The system provides new ideas for drug addiction rehabilitation, and uses BCI technology rather than traditional psychological scale assessment to evaluate the real situation of drug addicts, which makes the results more persuasive.","","978-1-83953-443-0","10.1049/cp.2019.1195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307489","DRUG ADDICTION;REHABILITATION;SELF-CONTROL;VR;BCI","Drugs;Automobiles;Medical treatment;Games;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Electroencephalography","","","","","","","","4 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Whereas, the direct measurement of CAP is invasive. Multichannel blind system identification (MBSI) provides a method for noninvasive CAP estimation from two or more PAP waveforms such as brachial and femoral pulse waves. However, most previous MBSI methods require the prior knowledge and manual searching for unknown model order, which greatly influence the accuracy of the CAP estimation. In this paper, we employed a genetic algorithm (GA) method for automatically identifying the model orders and parameters in MBSI technique to improve the accuracy of CAP estimation. The performance of the proposed GA-MBSI algorithm was evaluated in comparison with three previous MBSI methods. Preliminary experimental results using data from three Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats showed that the proposed GA-MBSI algorithm could provide an improvement on estimating the beat-to-beat systolic pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and total waveform (TW) of the CAP with root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.02+0.76 mmHg, 0.30+0.14 mmHg, and 1.30+0.38 mmHg, respectively. In comparison to the three previous MBSI methods, the proposed method efficiently reduced the RMSE of SBP, MAP and TW of the estimated CAP by at least 9.42%, 34.78%, and 3.70%, respectively. The pilot results suggest that the proposed GA-MBSI algorithm is potential to serve as a reliable method for noninvasive and continuous CAP estimation.","","978-1-83953-443-0","10.1049/cp.2019.1202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307496","CENTRAL AORTIC PRESSURE WAVEFORM;PERIPHERAL AORTIC PRESSURE WAVEFORM;GENETIC ALGORITHM;MULTICHANNEL BLIND SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION;CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM","Mathematical model;Genetic algorithms;Biological cells;Blood pressure;Statistics;Sociology;Estimation","","","","","","","","4 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this study, a non-contact electrode that does not need any conductive gel nor ohmic connection with the skin was presented to apply high-quality physiological signals. It was made up of flexible printed circuits materials and the surface signal can be obtained by the principle of capacitive coupling. The results showed that the proposed non-contact electrode could acquire high-quality ECG compared to wet Ag/AgCl electrode. The correlation coefficient of the ECG waveforms was as high as 98.10% in the quiet state and 90.80% in the motion state between standard electrode and our non-contact electrode. The electrode was capable of obtaining good ECG signals even when the subject was walking at a speed up to 6 km/h.

In this work, the rectangular defects with various lengths and widths are investigated, as well as the cylinder defects with different radii. We note that the increase of the defect length will lead to a decrease of the received signal amplitude for the receiving transducer, and the amplitude increases as the defect width increases.

However, the relatively high capital cost hinders the development of AA-CAES system. As a result, the cost-benefit analysis of AA-CAES application is studied in this paper. The thermodynamic characteristics of AA-CAES system are carefully studied and modeled. An optimal configuration method of AA-CAES capacity considering energy arbitrage is proposed and the optimal capacity of each component of AA-CAES is demonstrated. Simulation results indicate that the application of AA-CAES in arbitrage market is profitable but the payback period is long. The profit estimations are more realistic compare to conventional battery model. Profitable cost range of AA-CAES is found through sensibility analysis. Augmenting electricity price to improve economic of AA-CAES is discussed at the end.","","978-1-83953-390-7","10.1049/cp.2019.1179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240166","Compressed energy storage;capacity allocation;energy market","","","","","","","","","4 Mar 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, ERA requires the prior knowledge of the number of modes present in the signal. Therefore, a modified ERA-based mode identification method is proposed in this paper with a new way of order determination. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain an accurate model order estimation at different noise levels. Furthermore, the proposed method is tested on a 36-bus benchmark system as well as on measurement data from a real power system. Comparison of the proposed method with other methods is also carried out.

In this work, we update RPM emissions from paved roads in the PM10 EI by applying a novel methodology developed by the Spanish Research Council (CSIC), and we assess EI improvements with an air quality model. The CSIC approach reduces RPM emissions from paved roads by 97% compared to the EPA-AP-42 approach and leads to better PM10 model performance.

There are several sources of this deterioration among which are transport, industry and agriculture, all also influenced by population growth. However, in urban areas, transport is primarily responsible for the deterioration of air quality and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Argentina is the South American country with the highest urbanization rate in the region, with more than 92% of the population residing in urban areas and almost 50% concentrated in only 8 cities. This has resulted in an increasingly intensive use of motorized transport, not only because of the large distances that must be traveled, but also influenced by the ease of purchase of private vehicles (installment payments, “self-saving” plans, etc.), low air ticket costs, but also due to the inefficiency of public land transport. It is then necessary to know the magnitudes of the emissions generated and thus be able to develop public policies. That is why this work aims to present an inventory that simultaneously includes emissions from land transport and air transport in the city of Córdoba (Argentina), considering greenhouse gases (GHG) (CO2, N2O and CH4) and air pollutants (PM, NOx, VOCs, SOx and CO. The results indicate that land transport contributes 3.7 × 106 tons per year of CO2e, while air transport 2.5 × 104 tons of CO2e.

The idea of Least Significant Bit based image steganography and data hiding technique is utilized to come up with an image-based authentication to make it easier for the users to maintain their password. The proposed technique also resolve the burden of memorizing every password for all accounts and avoid “Shoulder surfing” by hiding the password in the cover image. Although there is a rising number of innovative ways to authenticate users and text-based passwords are still popular and generally used method, the proposed technique aims to improve existing authentication and address the drawbacks of text-based authentication. The use of randomized embedding, image partitioning, and columnar transposition help increase the complexity of the extraction of the password embedded in the cover image. At the same time, the use of the one-time pad Encryption added a layer of security in keeping the password. In this way, the password is kept secure and confidential. A series of testing was conducted to verify the outcome of the proposed technique. The Peak-to-Signal-Noise-ratio (PSNR) and Similarity Index (SSIM) average result is 72.5688 and 0.9999, respectively. The result proves that the generated image password has high imperceptibility.

There are several issues related to the transportation of goods in the city, e.g. environmental and energy issue. With the problems of transportation of products in the urban area, the concept of city logistics was introduced. One of the city logistics solutions is the use of various types of vehicles to transport products, including small vehicles. This study develops an assignment first routing second (AFRS) algorithm to solve the heterogeneous vehicle routing problems in the context of city logistics. The algorithm is divided into two mathematical models; i.e. assignment problem and travelling salesman problem. The branch-and-bound method is used for solving those problems. In this research, there are many types of vehicles used to deliver goods to consumers in the urban area. The algorithm considers the level of congestion in the customer area. The main purpose of the algorithm is to make the right assignments, so the small vehicles can be optimally assigned to serve customers, especially in congested areas, but do not exceed their vehicle capacity. Then, this research determines the most optimal route with the objective function is to minimize the total distance travelled by each vehicle. This study used hypothetical data to test and verify the algorithm. Seven data instances are developed with the number of customers are ranged from 20 to 80 customers, also with various type and amount of vehicles for each case. From the computational results, the algorithm successfully found the optimal assignments strategy for six datasets. In that strategy, the small vehicles are optimally assigned to serve as many customers as possible, especially for customers in congested areas. The optimal route for each vehicle is also found with the travelling salesman problem (TSP) model.","","978-1-7281-3134-4","10.1109/TIME-E47986.2019.9353311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9353311","assignment;routing;city logistics","Urban areas;Software algorithms;Transportation;Routing;Mathematical model;Vehicle dynamics;Logistics","logistics;optimisation;travelling salesman problems;tree searching;vehicle routing","assignment first routing;economic development;urban area;transportation;environmental energy issue;city logistics solutions;heterogeneous vehicle routing problems;assignment problem;vehicle capacity;optimal assignments strategy;travelling salesman problem model;AFRS algorithm;branch-and-bound method","","","","19","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, it has introduced a new reliability problem called row-hammering, in which, in case that a certain row is activated too frequently, one or more bits in the adjacent rows are unintentionally corrupted. It is crucial to address row-hammering errors because they not only can be exploited by a malicious attack for modern computing systems but also may occur in general applications stored in a highly scaled-down DRAM. Even if several methods have been proposed to resolve row-hammering, existing solutions have limited capability to prevent row-hammering from occurring. Hence, a more robust solution for row-hammering is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel row-hammering mitigation mechanism, called Adaptive-probabilistic Additional Row Refresh (AARR). The main observation exploited by the proposed method is that each memory access does not have an equal degree of threat to cause row-hammering: accessing a row that has been frequently activated is much vulnerable to row-hammering rather than a barely activated row. In AARR, a small table and a few logic blocks are added to keep track of the threat level that causes row-hammering. Then, one of the adjacent rows of an accessed row is refreshed with an adaptive probability that corresponds to the threat level of that memory access. Our evaluation results show that the proposed method renders the most reliable protection against row-hammering with the lowest overhead on performance and energy compared to two well-known existing solutions.","","978-1-7281-3134-4","10.1109/TIME-E47986.2019.9353293","Technology Innovation Program MOTIE(grant numbers:10076583); Competency Development Program for Industry Specialists MOTIE(grant numbers:0001883); IC Design Education Center (IDEC), Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9353293","DRAM;row-hammering;probability-based;aggressor row;victim row;reliability;security","Manufacturing processes;Random access memory;Reliability","DRAM chips;integrated circuit reliability;probability","adjacent rows;row-hammering errors;novel row-hammering mitigation mechanism;adaptive-probabilistic additional row refresh mechanism;DRAM manufacturing process technology;dense chip capacity;malicious attack;AARR;logic blocks;memory access","","","","16","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses a microgrid testbed simulation consisting of one synchronous generator, two induction generators, three induction motors, busbar, and load. The induction motor is used as prime mover which controlled by inverter. The operation of microgrid testbed, both in stand-alone as well as parallel operation, can affect frequency. The speed of prime mover is used to maintain the frequency of the system at 50 Hz (±1 %). The method used to control the speed of prime mover is by changing the frequency of the power source. The best stand-alone operation frequency (50 Hz) of induction generator is achieved by setting the power source frequency to 46 Hz to get the motor speed of 0.85 pu, while synchronous generator operation achieved with setting the power source frequency to 45 Hz and the motor speed of 0.9 pu. The oscillation occurred shortly when induction generator 1 and 2 connected to the system in parallel operation. This happens because the induction generator not only acts as an active power supply, but also absorbs reactive power from the system, so it affects the changes of frequency. The synchronous generator as the primary generator can reduce oscillation because it acts as both active and reactive power supply to the system, so it can stabilize the frequency.","","978-1-7281-3134-4","10.1109/TIME-E47986.2019.9353304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9353304","microgrid testbed;induction motor;inverter;simulation;frequency","Reactive power;Induction motors;Induction generators;Microgrids;Synchronous motors;Synchronous generators;Frequency synchronization","asynchronous generators;busbars;distributed power generation;induction motors;invertors;load (electric);power grids;reactive power;synchronous generators","reactive power;induction motor inverter drive;induction generator;power source frequency;dynamic modeling;microgrid testbed simulation system;synchronous generator;induction motor;busbar;stand-alone operation frequency;frequency 50.0 Hz;frequency 46.0 Hz;frequency 45.0 Hz","","","","13","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm security depends on the complexity of solving the discrete logarithm and the integer factorization problem. The security also depends on the length of bits keys used. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid algorithm, the combination of Modified Diffie Hellman (MDH) with the Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) algorithm. The MDH will not use primitive root (g). Instead, it will use two prime numbers (P and Q) for key exchange. It reduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. Furthermore, the MDH has an authentication mechanism. If both shared keys are equal, the communication will continue. Otherwise, it will stop because it is compromised. Also, the RSA algorithm will use the two prime numbers generated by MDH (P and Q). The RSA algorithm will perform the encryption and decryption message. The Diffie Hellman (DH) and the RSA Algorithms are the basis of several security standards and services on the internet, especially TLS and SSL. If the security of both algorithms is compromised, such systems will collapse. In this proposal, the combined cryptography system aims to achieve secret message exchange; it uses random prime numbers after multiplication and eventually shared with the other end of a communication. The proposed algorithm secretly generate a value so that the security level increases.","","978-1-7281-3134-4","10.1109/TIME-E47986.2019.9353292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9353292","Diffie Hellman;RSA;Public Key Pair Based Authentication","Authentication;Hybrid power systems;Encryption;Complexity theory;Security;Proposals;Standards","public key cryptography;telecommunication security","classic Diffie-Hellman algorithm;RSA algorithm;key exchange;prime numbers;MDH;bits keys;integer factorization problem;algorithm security;security problems;security standards;RSA Algorithms","","","","20","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quality of the image plays a vital role in increasing the success rate of image recognition and related fields. Image quality can be degraded due to distortion, imperfection during image capture, inappropriate light balancing, and exposure to name a few. Various deblurring techniques were introduced to address blurred issues, transforming an image to lesser imperfections, successfully reading and/or identifying available details on it. This study aims to identify, define, and evaluate deblurring techniques in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in the design. Significantly, the study compares various techniques that can be used to recover hidden details in the presence of image noise. The MA TLAB was used as a tool for testing and evaluating the deblurring techniques. PSNR, MSE, and computational time were used to compare each identified deblurring techniques. Based on the comparative performance results of each technique, in terms of accuracy measure, Lucy-Richardson got the highest PSNR ratio of 25.8312 that leads the best result while wiener filter got the lowest PSNR ratio of 21.3012.

Also, some CNNs incorporate channel attention mechanisms that re-scale each channel of intermediate feature maps based on their importance. The channel attention modules squeeze the spatial information of a feature into a representative value to transform it as a re-scaling value. In order to reduce the amount of information, attention modules have utilized hand-designed pooling functions such as max pooling or average pooling which have been widely adopted in CNNs, because they add negligible computational complexity. However, a significant amount of spatial information is lost due to these pooling functions. In this paper, we propose a generalized pooling function that scales down spatial information with respect to the importance of each pixel. Unlike max pooling or average pooling, our score-based aggregation is capable of flexibly adjusting to input. Also, the score-based aggregation function learns how to squeeze the spatial information into the must appropriate representative value, which will convert the pooling into a spatial attention mechanism. Finally, we propose a novel method called Score-based Aggregated Attention Module (SAAM) that utilizes the proposed score-based aggregation. Our experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that SAAM achieves the highest classification accuracy improvement among existing channel attention modules since the score-based aggregation in SAAM is a more dynamic and effective method than the hand-designed aggregations.","","978-1-7281-3134-4","10.1109/TIME-E47986.2019.9353302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9353302","","Computer vision;Transforms;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Computational complexity;Image classification","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","score-based aggregation;hand-designed aggregations;image classification tasks;computer vision tasks;bountiful features;CNNs incorporate channel attention mechanisms;intermediate feature maps;channel attention modules;spatial information;representative value;hand-designed pooling functions;max pooling;average pooling;generalized pooling function;spatial attention mechanism;Score-based Aggregated Attention Module","","","","16","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Amongst candidate bands to be allocated for IMT-2020 mid bands, the extended C-band (±3.5 GHz) becomes favorite due to its advantages in terms of both technology and economy. Thus, many countries identify it as one of the candidate bands for IMT-2020. In Indonesia, C-Band and extended C-band are primarily occupied by Fixed-Satellite Services (FSS) because of its robustness to heavy rain. This study investigates the feasibility for IMT-2020 and FSS systems to coexist in the extended-C band by analyzing the possibility of interference from IMT-2020 base stations to FSS earth stations using deterministic calculations. The calculations use FSS earth station and IMT-2020 base station trial parameters in Indonesia. The study results show that under any circumstances, co-channel scenario is very challenging since it requires very significant separation distance between the two systems. By employing off-axis angle of 50°, IMT 2020 base station need to be separated at least 78 km away from any FSS earth station. On the contrary, in the adjacent channel scenario, two systems are possible to coexist with a small protection distance (about 1 km) and a guard band of 10 MHz. The protection distance can be minimized by directing the IMT-2020 base station transmitting antenna away from the direction of the FSS earth station antenna.","","978-1-7281-3134-4","10.1109/TIME-E47986.2019.9353306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9353306","extended C-Band;deterministic calculations;FSS;IMT-2020;interference","Frequency selective surfaces;Earth;Base stations;5G mobile communication;Transmitting antennas;Directive antennas;Robustness","3G mobile communication;aircraft communication;cellular radio;cochannel interference;satellite ground stations;transmitting antennas","extended C-band;extended-C band;IMT-2020 base stations;IMT-2020 base station trial parameters;IMT 2020 base station need;guard band;IMT-2020 base station transmitting antenna;FSS earth station antenna;frequency 3.5 GHz;frequency 10.0 MHz","","","","23","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the sensors are placed on the sides of the human's fingertips, and measure the deformation of the fingerpad resulting from interaction with objects. The current paper proposes a vastly improved design, using four 3-axis sensors to measure the fingerpad deformation. Thereby, the area of the fingertip from which forces can be detected is larger, and a higher signal-to-noise ratio was achieved.

Y-function method was used to extract mobility and its degradation coefficients. Differently from previously reported data from pMOS transistors, in which carrier mobility degrades with substrate bias increase, an improvement in carrier mobility is verified for n-type devices when back bias is increased from negative voltages up to 10V. However, by raising back bias up to 100V, causes carrier mobility degradation. Three-dimensional simulations confirmed this effect and showed that strong back bias attract the channel to the bottom interface, causing carrier confinement and, thus, increasing scattering mechanisms.","2573-5926","978-1-7281-3523-6","10.1109/S3S46989.2019.9320726","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320726","mobility;substrate bias;nanowire;SOI MOSFET","MOSFET;Substrates;Logic gates;Degradation;Transistors;Voltage measurement;Nanoscale devices","carrier mobility;MOSFET;nanowires;semiconductor device models;silicon-on-insulator","carrier mobility variation;degradation coefficients;pMOS transistors;substrate bias;carrier mobility degradation;carrier confinement;n-type Ω-gate SOI nanowire MOSFET;n-type Ω-gate SOI nanowire MOS transistors;p-type Ω-gate SOI nanowire MOS transistors;n-type devices;back bias;three-dimensional simulations;scattering mechanisms","","","","10","IEEE","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The monolithic 3D architecture embraces a methodic “system-on-top-of-system” approach that effectively suppresses RC-delays by eliminating all global and semi-global on-chip interconnects. The DS-FD-SOI CMOS eliminates the need for Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) and enables shorter less resistive vertical interconnections while its secondary Gate contributes further to reducing RC-delays and it also trims the Standby power by up to 4 orders of magnitude. Preliminary simulations on this novel monolithic 3D architecture demonstrates clock-speed up to 20GHz with dynamic losses that are order(s) of magnitude lower than those in today's conventional 2D CPUs that use standard FD-SOI CMOS when these are clocked at 5GHz and interconnected to one another through long global and semi-global interconnects.","2573-5926","978-1-7281-3523-6","10.1109/S3S46989.2019.9320673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320673","monolithic 3D;fully-depleted SOI;double-gate","Three-dimensional displays;Logic gates;Transistors;Semiconductor device modeling;Two dimensional displays;Integrated circuit interconnections;Solid modeling","CMOS digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;microprocessor chips;silicon-on-insulator;system-on-chip;three-dimensional integrated circuits","high-rise 3-Dimentional CPU;RC-delays;DS-FD-SOI CMOS;Through-Silicon-Vias;shorter less resistive vertical interconnections;standard FD-SOI CMOS;semiglobal interconnects;pathfinding architecture;record CPU performance;clock speed;self-heating;next-generation monolithic 3D CPU;2D CPU;monolithic 3D architecture;system-on-top-of-system;double-sided fully-depleted-SOI CMOS;TSV;dark silicon;SOC;double-sided fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS architecture;frequency 20.0 GHz;frequency 5.0 GHz","","","","5","IEEE","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we verify this theory through numerical calculations and Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) simulations calibrated to quantum solvers for electrostatics. It is found that SS degradation increases as the source metal workfunction increases. In the nanowire simulated, SS increases from 94mV/dec to 109mV/dec for gate length, LG, = 10nm and from 72mV/dec to 88mV/dec for LG = 15nm, representing an increase of effective carrier temperature from 300K to more than 340K.","2573-5926","978-1-7281-3523-6","10.1109/S3S46989.2019.9320746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320746","Sub-threshold Slope;Energy Filter;Nanowire;Schottky Contact;Ballistic Transport","Nanowires;Schottky barriers;Scattering;Tunneling;Metals;Logic gates;Filtering","electrostatics;MOSFET;nanowires;semiconductor device models;technology CAD (electronics)","subthreshold slope;ultra-scaled MOSFET;energy filtering;source contact;ultra-scaled Field Effect Transistors;nanowire;energy filter;channel barrier;inelastic scattering;short source-contact-to-channel region;Technology Computer-Aided-Design simulations;SS degradation;source metal work function;carrier temperature;TCAD simulations;quantum solvers;size 10.0 nm;size 15.0 nm","","","","13","USGov","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, NWJAMFETs suffer from an enhanced detrimental lateral-band-to-band tunneling (L-BTBT) which restricts their scaling to sub-10 nm regime. Therefore, we investigate the scalability of NW JAMFETs using an intrinsic pocket in the extension regions. Using calibrated 3-D simulations, we demonstrate that the incorporation of an intrinsic pocket substantially reduces the L-BTBT induced OFF-state current by around 2 orders and 4 orders of magnitude for a gate length of 20 nm and 7 nm, respectively, leading to a significant ON-state to OFF-state current ratio (ION/IOFF) of 106 and 105, respectively and a small DIBL of 12mV/V and subthreshold swing (SS) of 62.2mV/dec for 20 nm gate length device. The NW JAMFET with intrinsic pocket (Pi-NW JAMFET) exhibits superior short channel characteristics due to the reduced electrostatic source/channel-to-drain coupling and a diminished parasitic BJT action in the sub-10 nm regime extending the roadmap for the device scaling. The proposed Pi-NW JAMFETs show superior performance even at a scaled contacted poly pitch (CPP) of 52 nm with IOFF~28pA/um for a gate length of 7 nm. The excellent OFF-state characteristics of Pi-NW JAMFET makes them a lucrative FET architecture for realizing sub-10 nm channel lengths for low power and low leakage applications.","2573-5926","978-1-7281-3523-6","10.1109/S3S46989.2019.9320703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320703","Nanowire;Lateral Band-to-band-tunneling (L-BTBT);Junctionless accumulation mode FETs;Parasitic BJT","Logic gates;Field effect transistors;Tunneling;Semiconductor process modeling;Scalability;Photonic band gap;Performance evaluation","junctionless nanowire transistors;low-power electronics;nanoelectronics;semiconductor device models;tunnel field-effect transistors","intrinsic pocket;junctionless FET;lateral-band-to-band tunneling;L-BTBT;OFF-state characteristics;lucrative FET architecture;NWJAMFET;nanowire junctionless accumulation Mode FET;calibrated 3D simulations;reduced electrostatic source;channel-to-drain coupling;low power applications;low leakage applications;size 7.0 nm;size 20.0 nm;size 52.0 nm","","","","10","IEEE","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is revealed through 2D-TCAD analysis that along with gate oxide traps, traps at back-side interface can significantly alter the performance of In0.53Ga0.47As on insulator TFET. The presence of In0.53Ga0.47As/BOX traps alone can increase the OFF current ~ 22 times, and cumulative effect of the presence of traps at gate oxide interface and In0.53Ga0.47As/BOX interface is an increase in OFF current by ~ 3 order of magnitude, thus deteriorating the ON=OFF current ratio significantly. We also propose the methodologies to mitigate the effect of traps in OFF state. By mitigating the decrease in flat band voltage caused by presence of traps, through p type doping of channel instead of n-type channel and using the graded doping in the source, the OFF current is reduced in trap affected TFET. The application of proposed methodology in trap affected TFET offers > 3 order reduction in OFF current, thus restoring the ON=OFF current of In0.53Ga0.47As TFET.

This prevents the direct contact of the two wafers and results in unbonded area. To address this, a CMP process that using conventional SiO2 slurry with the addition of diamond nanoparticles is carried out on the GaN (LED)-on-Si wafer prior to the bonding to the Si-CMOS wafer. The second issue is that the Si substrate of the GaN LED wafer absorbs photons which lowers the light emitting efficiency of the LEDs.

In other words, the same Cratio can be achieved at a lower voltage. This can further be increased by increasing the thickness of the ferroelectric layer (tfe), however, at the cost of a lower Quality (Q) factor and a higher variation in the VCO gain/sensitivity. We further investigate the impact of geometrical and material parameters and find that in general, a small interfacial oxide thickness (tox), a smaller area of the ferroelectric layer (Afe) compared to the internal gate area (AMOS), and the ferroelectric materials with a high coercive field (Ec) and a low remnant polarization (Pr) can all boost the Cratio.","2573-5926","978-1-7281-3523-6","10.1109/S3S46989.2019.9320695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320695","ferroelectric;negative capacitance;MOS varactor;capacitance tuning ratio","Capacitance;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Tuning;Logic gates;Varactors;Reactive power;Q-factor","capacitance;dielectric polarisation;ferroelectric materials;high-k dielectric thin films;MIS devices;Q-factor;varactors;voltage-controlled oscillators","negative capacitance technology;negative capacitance property;capacitance tuning ratio;frequency control;RF voltage controlled oscillator;conventional High-κ layer;ferroelectric material;High-κ Metal Gate stack;ferroelectric layer;lower Quality factor;geometrical parameters;material parameters;interfacial oxide thickness;internal gate area;high coercive field;RF MOS varactors","","","","7","IEEE","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So there is a possibility of estimating internal operation timing from observed EM radiation. If the attacker can capture the internal operation timing such as the sensing timing of the sensor from the radiated EM waves, new security issues appear. For example, the spoofing attack on ToF (Time of Flight) rangefinder becomes easier because the EM waves may expand the attack range to an unreachable area of the sensing signal.

A method evaluating the SCA resistance of cryptographic circuits based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the side-channel trace is examined. Here, it is assumed that SNR is used as SCA resistance design targets and the targets are determined based on analytically derived relationship between the SNR and correlation coefficients calculated in SCA. This work has experimentally verified that the SNR and correlation coefficients calculated from measured side-channel traces satisfy the relationship. A printed circuit board (PCB) with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementing an advanced encryption standard (AES) circuit was used as an equipment under test, and the core power supply voltage fluctuation of the FPGA was measured on the PCB as side-channel trace. The SNR is calculated using a signal component obtained from the trace when encrypting a random plaintext set and a noise component obtained from the trace when encrypting a constant plaintext set. The correlation coefficient is calculated based on the correlation power analysis. The SNR was changed in the range of 20 dB by changing measurement conditions, and the relationship was examined. As a result, the SNRs and the correlation coefficients of the measured trace obeyed the analytical relational expression.","","978-4-8855-2322-9","10.23919/EMCSapporo/APEMC44270.2019.9320847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320847","side-channel attack (SCA);advanced encryption standard (AES);signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","Signal to noise ratio;Correlation coefficient;Cryptography;Power measurement;Probes;Noise measurement;Field programmable gate arrays","cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;logic testing;printed circuit testing","equipment under test;AES circuit;advanced encryption standard circuit;FPGA;field-programmable gate array;SCA resistance design target;countermeasure circuit;correlation power analysis;printed circuit board;side-channel trace;cryptographic circuits;SCA resistance evaluation method;differential power analysis;leakage trace SNR","","1","","9","","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this study will discuss about the method for estimating system inertia using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) only with frequency measurement data. The training and validation data for ANN are obtained from the simulation results of power swing equation. After that, the ANN network is used to estimate the inertia magnitude of isolated system from the real measurement data.

In the other hand, the telecommunication industry which is predicted will decline in the future and needs to take precautions, there are two things that become solution; saving and entering new businesses. The solution discussed in this study is savings. More than 60% of Mobile Network Operators (MNO) in the world use Radio Access Network Sharing (RAN Sharing) to make savings. The type of RAN Sharing used in this study is the Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) that shared up to the frequency spectrum, and it can also be a solution to the scarcity of the spectrum, saving operator's expenses, accelerating network deployment to the regions and impacting on GDP in Indonesia. In this study, there are three aspects that will be discussed; technical, economic and legal aspects. In technical aspect, rural area use coverage dimensioning to determine the needs of telecommunication infrastructures. In the economic aspect, the calculation uses Net Present Value (NPV) which is analyzed using the Game Theory approach. For the legal aspect, several regulations in Indonesia related to spectrum sharing are explained to see the possibility of how this sharing can be implemented in Indonesia. Based on this research, sharing using MOCN may providing savings in rural areas and can affect competition between operators if only done by two competitors. In addition, in terms of regulations, this implementation is possible while obtaining ministerial permits but needs further study because there is a potential change in competition and double charge of usage rights fees (BHP).","","978-1-7281-1554-2","10.1109/APCoRISE46197.2019.9318809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318809","Network sharing;Multi-Operator Core Network;Spectrum Frequency;Telecom Industry;Regulation of Telecommunication","Communications technology;Logic gates;Economics;Regulation;Base stations;Radio spectrum management;Long Term Evolution","game theory;mobile radio;radio access networks;radio spectrum management;radiowave propagation;telecommunication industry","techno-economics study;spectrum sharing;mobile network operator;rural area;MOCN;telecommunication industry;radio access network sharing;RAN sharing;frequency spectrum;network deployment;Indonesia;economic aspects;technical aspect;telecommunication infrastructures;economic aspect;legal aspect;multioperator core network;GDP impact;net present value;game theory;bandwidth 1800 MHz","","3","","25","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system is entirely controlled by the use of image processing and artificial intelligence techniques. Image processing leads for detecting the density of vehicles by using Haar Cascade method, whereas artificial intelligence helps to modify the timing of traffic signal accurately time by time. These process held automatically and police can monitor from police box all over the time by computer.

One approach to estimate the reliability of the meter is through the accelerated reliability testing. During the test, samples are tested inside a climatic-chamber with humidity and temperature above the operating conditions. The known testing procedures based on the IEC 62059-31-1:2008, however, is time-consuming. Some reasons are due to the daily-interval checking for all samples and the combination number of over-stresses in the test. For these reasons, the PLN proposed an alternative method by which it employs only the maximum temperature and humidity overstresses with a Weibull fitting-distribution. The method simplifies the former IEC method. It also gives benefit by allowing a modification on the duration and the number of samples based on the reliability target and the confidence level. With this approach, the length of the test reduces to about 20% in comparison to a full test recommended by the IEC.","","978-1-7281-1554-2","10.1109/APCoRISE46197.2019.9318789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318789","Reliability;Accelerated Reliability Testing;Accelerated Aging Test;Energy Meter","Reliability;Meters;Humidity;Statistics;Sociology;Testing;Life estimation","climatology;IEC standards;life testing;power meters;reliability;Weibull distribution","accelerated reliability testing;energy meter;humidity overstresses;PLN Indonesia;climatic-chamber;IEC 62059-31-1:2008 method;Weibull fitting-distribution","","","","8","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current methodologies for the application of data analytics and data mining techniques focus on finding correlations within data from existing systems and historic data. Therefore, data analytics is typically applied to solve existing problems within existing manufacturing systems. Since present brownfield production lines often provide insufficient data, new hardware has to be retrofitted to acquire the required data. Hence, valuable time for problem solving is lost. This paper presents an approach to proactively implement data analytics during early predevelopment phases in order to allow scalability of the approach to large scale manufacturing systems.

Transboundary movement of WEEE occurs due to unclear boundaries between WEEE and UEEE. As a consequence, many countries took advantage of the opportunity to export their WEEE on behalf of UEEE. This conceptual paper discusses the application of game theory to WEEE and UEEE research by highlighting the strategy in game theory in various aspects of the transboundary movement. Game theory is one of the mathematical models often used in dealing with environmental issues, but there is no research that uses game theory to deal with transboundary movement of electronic waste issue. Therefore, this research was conducted to fill the gap and provide a broader understanding of game theory. For this purpose, the first step is to describe the basic formulas in game theory, their uses and limitations, and applications in environmental problems. Then, examine several strategies for WEEE and UEEE problems with the game theory. The expected results of this study are to determine optimal strategies for developed and developing countries and to mediate countries involved in the transboundary movement of WEEE. These strategies are expected to reduce transboundary movement of WEEE between respected countries.","","978-1-7281-1554-2","10.1109/APCoRISE46197.2019.9318883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318883","WEEE;UEEE;Transboundary Movement;Game Theory","Electronic waste;Developing countries;Game theory;Regulation;Games;Recycling;Europe","game theory;mathematical analysis;WEEE Directive","transboundary movement;waste electrical and electronic equipment;game theory approach;WEEE;UEEE;electronic waste issue;mathematical models;environmental issues","","","","16","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To suppress the noise, a filtering mechanism is required. Exponential Moving Average filter (EMA) serves as a powerful yet exceptionally simple filter. However, selecting so-called Alpha parameter in EMA is not a straightforward task. Extremely large Alpha value lead to more noise in the signal and small Alpha value resulted in sluggish convergence to the true value. In many cases Alpha parameter is selected arbitrarily and then opted for the best performance, resulting in numerous trials and errors. This paper is aimed to present an insight to select Alpha parameter, that is by implementing Kalman Gain from Kalman Filter structure as Alpha parameter and simultaneously highlight the similarity between Discrete Linear Kalman filter and Exponential Moving Average filter through some mathematical manipulations. To demonstrate the filter performance, altitude data from BMP280 barometric sensor is filtered. The results show that the EMA with Kalman Gain is capable to converge to the true altitude value and for some reasons, EMA with Kalman Gain resembles Kalman Filter performance in this particular scenario.","","978-1-7281-1554-2","10.1109/APCoRISE46197.2019.9318810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318810","Alpha parameter;exponential moving average;kalman filter;kalman gain;filtering and smoothing","Kalman filters;Noise measurement;Current measurement;Convergence;Uncertainty;Covariance matrices;Time measurement","barometers;Kalman filters;sensors","filtering mechanism;EMA;Kalman gain;Kalman filter structure;altitude value;Alpha parameter;discrete linear Kalman filter;exponential moving average filter;BMP280 barometric sensor","","1","","21","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electric motors are promising products as an alternative mode of transportation for people by utilizing electricity as an energy source. To ensure the reliability and sustainability of these products in order to enter the automotive industry market and avoid negative sentiments in the form of consumers' concerns to recharge when they run out of electricity in the middle of their journey, it is proposed for the establishment of Battery Exchange Station (BES) in several locations in order to meet the availability of electrical energy supply in the form of batteries that are ready to use. Through the battery swapping method, electric motor users will exchange batteries that will run out with a new battery that has been charged 100% (fully charged). This causes the supplier is responsible for distributing the electric battery so that a model is needed to minimize distribution costs while maintaining inventory levels at the customer. The inventory routing problem model by considering stochastic demand and recharging time on BES is designed to solve that vendor problem related to the distribution of electric batteries. This problem is approached by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to determine the delivery route with a minimum total distance and modeled with the Markov Chain to determine scheduling related to its replenishment. The result revealed that cost of transportation will be minimum by TSP and cost of distribution (replenishment unit and truck dispatching) will be minimum by Modified Markov Chain Model.","","978-1-7281-1554-2","10.1109/APCoRISE46197.2019.9318824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318824","Stochastic Demand;Recharging Time;Battery Swapping;Battery Exchange Station;Inventory Routing Problem","Batteries;Routing;Modeling;Markov processes;Electric vehicles;Electric motors;Urban areas","automobile industry;battery powered vehicles;consumer behaviour;cost reduction;electric motors;electric vehicle charging;inventory management;Markov processes;reliability;scheduling;sustainable development;travelling salesman problems;vehicle routing","distribution cost;battery recharging time;modified Markov chain model;traveling salesman problem;TSP;vendor problem;stochastic demand;customer inventory levels;product sustainability;automotive industry market;product reliability;transportation cost minimization;electricity utilization;battery exchange station design;inventory routing problem algorithm;IRP;electric motors;battery swapping method;electrical energy supply;BES","","1","","11","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior state-of-the-art method namely ExCuSe undertakes these problems based on analysis of histogram intensity. However, ExCuSe fails to analyze some pupil images with poor illumination and light reflection occlusion caused by prescription glasses. To overcome this problem, this research proposes an improvement in ExCuSe by incorporating two image filtering techniques in the preprocessing step. The median filter is utilized to diminish noise while the guided filter is implemented to preserve edges in the image. We evaluated the improved and the state-of-the-art algorithm on over 16,000 hand-labeled images in three data sets that contain eyeglass occlusions. The experimental result of data set III shows that the proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithm with a 22.53% higher detection rate (p<; 0.05). Although implementation on the other two data sets did not achieve a statistically significant result, the overall performance of the proposed method was still better than the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our study indicates that the proposed method is more sophisticated to handle poor illumination and light reflection occlusion compared with the prior state-of-the-art technique. In future, the proposed pupil detection method can be implemented in an eye tracker for interactive systems as well as for passive monitoring system.","","978-1-7281-1554-2","10.1109/APCoRISE46197.2019.9318871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318871","Eye Tracking;Computer Vision;Pupil Detection;Eyeglass Occlusion;Median Filter;Guided Filter","Pupils;Image edge detection;Histograms;Visualization;Lighting;Glass;Gaze tracking","gaze tracking;image denoising;image filtering;median filters;object detection","improved pupil detection method;eyeglass occlusions;eye tracking;prescription glasses;histogram intensity;poor illumination;light reflection occlusion;image filtering techniques;median filter;guided filter;highly off-axial positions;ExCuSe method;eye tracker;interactive systems;passive monitoring system","","","","18","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technological management method developed by Kano Models was used to assess the social aspect, and the net benefit was calculated to assess the economic aspect. The findings indicated that most existing services offered via satellite are in the attractive category, meaning that if such satellite services are eliminated, the market will not change significantly; however, implementing 5G at the frequency of 3.5 GHz would increase economic value due to the much higher license fee paid by the operators to the government.","","978-1-7281-1554-2","10.1109/APCoRISE46197.2019.9318973","Universitas Indonesia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318973","5G;Satellite;Spectrum Management;Indonesia;Technology Management","5G mobile communication;Satellite broadcasting;Economics;Satellites;Radio spectrum management;Biological system modeling;Licenses","5G mobile communication;customer satisfaction;customer services;innovation management;technology management","satellite services;social aspects;economic aspects;5G mobile technology;Indonesia;economic aspect;Kano models","","1","","11","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are investigating infrared (IR) thermography as a noninvasive adjunct to mammography for breast cancer screening. IR imaging is radiation-free, pain-free, and non-contact. Automatic segmentation of the breast area from the acquired full-size breast IR images will help limit the area for tumor search, as well as reduce the time and effort costs of manual hand segmentation. Autoencoder-like convolutional and deconvolutional neural networks (C-DCNN) had been applied to automatically segment the breast area in IR images in previous studies. In this study, we applied a state-of-the-art deep-learning segmentation model, MultiResUnet, which consists of an encoder part to capture features and a decoder part for precise localization. It was used to segment the breast area by using a set of breast IR images, collected in our clinical trials by imaging breast cancer patients and normal volunteers with our infrared camera (N2 Imager). The database we used has 450 images, acquired from 14 patients and 16 volunteers. We used a thresholding method to remove interference in the raw images and remapped them from the original 16-bit to 8-bit, and then cropped and segmented the 8-bit images manually. Experiments using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and comparison with the ground-truth images by using Tanimoto similarity show that the average accuracy of MultiResUnet is 91.47%, which is about 2% higher than that of the autoencoder.

We propose a more practical approach to explore the synthesis-process relationships of CNT forests using machine learning (ML) algorithms to infer the underlying complex physical processes. Currently, no such ML model linking CNT forest morphology to synthesis parameters has been demonstrated. In the current work, we use a physics-based numerical model to generate CNT forest morphology images with known synthesis parameters to train such a ML algorithm. The CNT forest synthesis variables of CNT diameter and CNT number densities are varied to generate a total of 12 distinct CNT forest classes. Images of the resultant CNT forests at different time steps during the growth and self-assembly process are then used as the training dataset. Based on the CNT forest structural morphology, multiple single and combined histogram-based texture descriptors are used as features to build a random forest (RF) classifier to predict class labels based on correlation of CNT forest physical attributes with the growth parameters. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of up to 83.5% on predicting the synthesis conditions of CNT number density and diameter. These results are the first step towards rapidly characterizing CNT forest attributes using machine learning. Identifying the relevant process-structure interactions for the CNT forests using physics-based simulations and machine learning could rapidly advance the design, development, and adoption of CNT forest applications with varied morphologies and properties.","2332-5615","978-1-7281-4732-1","10.1109/AIPR47015.2019.9316542","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:CMMI 1651538); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316542","Finite Element;Simulation;Carbon Nanotubes;Local Feature Extraction;Random Forests;Classification","Forestry;Morphology;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Training;Random forests;Radio frequency","carbon nanotubes;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);materials science computing;self-assembly","carbon nanotube forest synthesis-structure relationships;physics-based simulation;parameter space;experimental exploration;numerical exploration;synthesis prohibitive;synthesis-process relationships;machine learning algorithms;complex physical processes;ML model;physics-based numerical model;CNT forest morphology images;synthesis parameters;ML algorithm;CNT forest synthesis variables;CNT diameter;CNT number densities;resultant CNT forests;CNT forest structural morphology;multiple single combined histogram-based texture descriptors;random forest classifier;CNT forest physical attributes;growth parameters;machine learning model;CNT forest attributes;relevant process-structure interactions;CNT forest applications;CNT forest classes","","5","","50","IEEE","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the sake of effective authentication, an efficient machine learning algorithm, the XGBoost, is leveraged to train the authentication model offline. When the online authentication process begins, the coarse authentication process is initially performed according to the RSS. If suspicious, the fine authentication process is further executed according to the CSI. Through simulation, we verify that the proposed scheme achieves high probability of detecting rogue APs and low probability of treating legitimate APs as rogue ones.

Here, we present an area 2D homogenized metamaterial slab as imaging device at THz frequencies. employing a simple analytical model and a transfer matrix method (TMM), we calculate transmission properties of slab. From the straightforward analytical model, we show that the metamaterial slab can resolve feature sizes below the diffraction limit.

To get the maximum power output and highest efficiency, trackers always track the sun and change panel position accordingly. The tracker automatically changes its position after every 2 to 3 degrees of misalignment, to prevent the power loss created by running motor continuously. The light intensities of both sides were compared by the sensors and move the panels towards the light. The panel continuously moves until the tracker detects the equal light falls on both sides. This project helps to improve the solar irradiance of the panel.","","978-1-7281-6410-6","10.1109/ICECTE48615.2019.9303534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303534","Renewable energy;Solar panel;Dual axis tracking;Microcontroller","Microcontrollers;Tracking;Sun;Solar panels;Sensors;Insulation life;Degradation","microcontrollers;photovoltaic power systems;solar cell arrays;solar power stations","solar photovoltaic panels;automatic dual axis;polar single axis solar tracker system;locked vertical axis;flexible horizontal axis;maximum power output;panel position;power loss;solar irradiance;dual axis tracking system;solar panel;solar energy;promising renewable energy resources;Ohm's law;power equation","","4","","6","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of this CAA is investigated and contrasted with traditional concentric circular antenna array (CCAA). Optimal CAA is compared with delay-and-sum (DAS) CAA and found that optimal CAA has higher interference cancellation ability in the presence of interference. The performance of optimal CAA is deteriorated if intended signal turns away from beam steering direction. The performance deterioration issue because of steering angle disparity (SAD), can be diminished by using fixed and variable diagonal loading robust techniques. From numerical results of MATLAB, it is ascertained that the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of suggested CAA is 36.35% narrower than traditional CCAA. Due to narrow beamwidth, the directivity of proposed CAA is superior and also side lobe level (SLL) is lower than existing CCAA. ODL based CAA delivers more robustness in case of SAD compared with existing FDL based CAA.","","978-1-7281-6410-6","10.1109/ICECTE48615.2019.9303584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303584","concentric circular antenna array;cylindrical antenna array;half-power beamwidth;optimal diagonal loading","Antenna arrays;Interference;Array signal processing;Loading;Antennas;Signal to noise ratio;Loaded antennas","antenna radiation patterns;array signal processing;beam steering;interference suppression","robust cylindrical antenna array;optimal diagonal loading technique;steering angle mismatch;concentric circular antenna array;optimal CAA;interference cancellation ability;beam steering direction;performance deterioration issue;fixed loading robust techniques;variable diagonal loading robust techniques;ODL based CAA;steering angle disparity","","","","7","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most of the hybrid precoding networks, the analog processing part is implemented by phase shifters (PS) which consumes high energy, or by low-complexity switches (SW) which reduces the power consumption to a great extent; where both architectures consider simply mmWave channel. In this research, energy efficiency (EE) of a low-complexity SW-based hybrid precoding utilizing the antenna selection (AS) algorithm is analyzed for a mmWave m-MIMO system in various channels (e.g., Rayleigh, Rician and Nakagami-m fading channel).

In this paper, a generative adversarial network (GAN) along with a pipeline is proposed for the prediction of possible audio after an input audio sequence. The proposed model uses short-time Fourier transformation of audio to make it an image. The image is then fed to a conditional GAN to predict the output image. After that, Inverse short-time Fourier transform is then applied to that predicted image, generating the predicted audio sequence. For a small audio sequence prediction, the proposed methodology is quite fast, robust and has achieved a loss of 0.43.

Moreover, from an effective plant of a farm, the farmer can sell the existing power to the nearby utilities after fulfilling its own requirements, hence reducing the burden of national grid. Again, the fertilizer obtained as a byproduct in this process can also be a source of earning. The acceptance of the model on the basis of economic analysis has also been evaluated.

They sometimes want the result just after the experiment. The motive of this paper is to scan the OMR sheets and collect data by image processing and matching the current data with the previous one to find out the latest or current results. 1. In today's world many exams are being conducted which offer Multiple Choice Questions to the students. These exams offer Multiple Choice Questions(MCQs) to the examines. Generally in examinations with MCQs, the OMR sheet is used. 2. There are many significant usages of this technology in different sectors such as institutional research, community and consumer surveys, data compilation, product evaluation and so on. It detects the specific pencil marked round bubble from the optical answer sheet of the multiple-choice questions. As it is a manual process, so many errors may occur here. In this paper, such a technique is invented which will overcome the limitations of the OMR machine. This system also works for the damaged sheets which the OMR machine does not at all. By scanning the hard copy of the OMR sheet and created a JPEG format database and a data set is used as the input. Different types of errors and image problems are solved to complete the process.

UHAA structured beamformer is chosen due to its symmetrical structure and it can scan signal over 360 degree. The proposed array's performance is contrasted with existing concentric circular antenna arrays (CCAA) to justify the superiority of the proposed UHAA. Moreover, optimal and delay-and-sum beamforming techniques are applied to the UHAA in the appearance of interference signal and steering direction error, and performance degradation of optimal UHAA is observed if the desired signal slightly deviates from the desired direction. To resolve this problem, a robust technique called fixed diagonal loading (FDL) technique is applied which makes the system robust enough. From the simulation result, improved half power beam-width (HPBW) as well as directivity are observed as both are 20.83% and 42.70% better than analysed CCAA.

Knowing the lack of effective and reliable biomarkers along with its high mortality rate, finding biomarkers from deferentially expressed genes can reduce the mortality rate. In our research paper, we studied different mRNA micro-array datasets (GSE6631 and GSE12452) for the identification of deferentially expressed genes. With the implementation of a parametric test (Student’s t-test) to identify the deferentially expressed genes with log fold change values. With careful inspection, we found a list of deferentially expressed genes consist of 365 up-regulated and 283 down-regulated genes in total by using Student t-test while keeping the p-value less than 0.05. Finally, after extensive analysis, two genes (PSPH and DST) were selected among them. With an overall endurance inspection, it indicates that PSPH and DST were associated with overall durability. Consequently, PSPH and DST can be the possible biomarkers and can act as a therapeutic objective to enhance the survival rate of Head and Neck Cancers.

Yet to manage the capacity of every beam should have perfect Channel State Information (CSI) in low RF chains condition. To overcome this limitation in this paper we propose a Regular Scanning Support Detection (RSSD) based channel estimation scheme. Especially we propose the use of a voltage doubler and a metal plate lens antenna where globose wavefront is reformed into plane wavefront but output wavefront is speeded up by material of lens which increases the spectral efficiency of the system.

MPPT is an electronic device that enables the system to draw the maximum available power, what PV panel is capable of generating under changing temperature and irradiance by using several types of algorithms and methods. Conventionally perturb and observe (P&O) method and incremental conductance method have been used for designing MPPT, as they provide a simple and cost effective way of tracking. But either they have drawback of slow operation or low tracking efficiency. However, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be deployed for this purpose, as they can track the optimal operating point (MPP) quickly and accurately based on training data sets. This paper presents three ANN based MPPT methods: Direct ANN, Cascaded ANN and the proposed Hybrid method. The ANN's are trained using training data set of maximum power point voltages (VMPP) from a user defined PV array over different environmental conditions (temperature and irradiance). In this research work, a user defined PV array and three MPPT models are simulated in SIMULINK.","","978-1-7281-6410-6","10.1109/ICECTE48615.2019.9303531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303531","Photovoltaic (PV);Maximum power point tracking (MPPT);Perturb & observe method (P&O);Artificial neural network (ANN)","Artificial neural networks;Maximum power point trackers;Training;Temperature sensors;Hybrid power systems;Photovoltaic systems;Temperature measurement","maximum power point trackers;neural nets;photovoltaic power systems;power system simulation","direct ANN;cascaded ANN;hybrid method;maximum power point voltages;MPPT models;maximum power point tracking;photovoltaic system;nonlinear behavior;environmental conditions;maximum power point tracker;electronic device;PV panel;incremental conductance method;low tracking efficiency;artificial neural networks;optimal operating point;training data sets;user defined PV array","","1","","6","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As production and quality of rice plays an important role in economy and food supply, diagnosis of rice diseases at betimes stage is momentous. The goal of our proposed work is detection and classification of rice plant diseases using simple image processing approach based on wavelet transform. This approach uses the multi-resolutional analysis, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to perform decomposition of the input image into horizontal, vertical, diagonal sub-bands. Different color and texture features are extracted from horizontal, vertical, diagonal sub-bands of the input image up to 2 levels and considered as features. Classification has been done by using an Ensemble of Linear Classifier adopting the Random Subspace Method (RSM).

It is evident from recent research that Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) can be used to sense cognitive load. CL analysis is important for understanding the mental growth of the child and the psychology of patients going through the different traumatic situation. Inspired by such a novel application, this model is designed. In this work, a technique has been demonstrated to measure and evaluate the level of human cognitive load for different tasks by collecting GSR from 40 student participants. The students are asked to sit for a test to solve three different tasks - reading comprehension, solving mathematics, and cracking Sudoku. Time-domain features have been extracted from participant's GSR signals while these tasks are being analyzed. Some parameters such as Correlation Dimension (CD), Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), Hurst Exponent (HE) and Shannon Entropy (SE) are used to analyze CL and these are used as features while accomplishing classification. The Level of stress or cognitive load is strongly observed with the one-way ANOVA test and box-whisker plots. Next, several machine learning algorithms are used to classify the various level of cognitive load. Using the 10 fold cross-validation and Naïve Bayes algorithm 91.5% accuracy is obtained.","","978-1-7281-6410-6","10.1109/ICECTE48615.2019.9303564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303564","Cognitive load;GSR signal;features;ANOVA test;Classification","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Stress;Time-domain analysis;Entropy;Correlation;Analysis of variance","bioelectric phenomena;cognition;computational complexity;entropy;feature extraction;human computer interaction;medical signal processing;naive Bayes methods;pattern classification;psychology;signal classification;skin;statistical testing","galvanic skin response signal;cognitive load classification;human-computer interaction paradigm;GSR signals;CL analysis;traumatic situation;human cognitive load;student participants;machine learning algorithms;machine learning classifier;psychology;child mental growth;reading comprehension;mathematics;Sudoku;time-domain feature extraction;correlation dimension;Lempel-Ziv complexity;Hurst exponent;Shannon entropy;one-way ANOVA test;box-whisker plots;10 fold cross-validation;naive Bayes algorithm","","2","","19","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Laboratory methods for identification of glutarylation are costly and take a lot of time. If a computational tool can identify lysine glutarylation sites efficiently, it will both save time and money. In our proposed method, a comparatively new feature extraction technique, peptide evolutionary features, has been used that gave sensitivity of 75.14%, specificity of 99.17%, accuracy of 87.16% and MCC of 0.76 for 5-fold cross-validation and sensitivity of 78.5%, specificity of 99.0%, accuracy of 88.5% and MCC of 0.78 for independent test set. Sequence based feature extraction techniques preserve less information for separating positives and negatives compared to the position specific evolutionary feature extraction technique, proposed in our model.

It is very difficult and challenging to deal with DNA methylation because of having high dimentionality and noisiness of methylation dataset. In this research work, we have proposed a machine learning based computational model for predicting DNA methylation. Our model is highly involved with bioinformatics and genomic information to extract genomic features. All previous works regarding the prediction of DNA methylation were only based on the statistical tools. Our model has two phases including the feature extraction and selection phase and the classification phase. In feature extraction phase we have used k-mer bioinformatics algorithm to extract the most appropriate features. Then using some statistical tools, we have selected the most discriminating features. Finally, we have chosen SVM, a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the DNA methylation status.

In this study, several feature encoding methods have been applied, i.e. amino acid factors (AAF), binary encoding (BE), and composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP) to encode features from peptide sequences of lysine glutarylation modification database. Multiple feature selection methods have been used, i.e. Student's t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method to improve the prediction performance of the whole system reducing the number of features. A combined feature selection approach has been proposed. Moreover, due to the imbalance problem of the dataset, a biased support vector machine has been used as the classification model. The performance of different feature selection approaches has been measured according to the area under curve (AUC). Experimental studies show that the features that are selected by the combined approach provide better performance and efficiency than that of by individual approach.","","978-1-7281-6410-6","10.1109/ICECTE48615.2019.9303538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303538","post translational modification;lysine glutarylation;mRMR;Student’s t-test;Kruskal-Wallis test;combined feature selection;biased SVM classifier","Feature extraction;Proteins;Amino acids;Encoding;Peptides;Support vector machines;Training","bioinformatics;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;pattern classification;proteins;support vector machines","feature encoding methods;binary encoding;lysine glutarylation modification database;multiple feature selection methods;minimum redundancy maximum relevance method;lysine glutarylation sites;dynamic conserved post-translational modification;machine learning techniques;glutarylated site identification;biological mechanism processes;amino acid factors;k-spaced amino acid pairs;Kruskal-Wallis test;area under curve;biased support vector machine","","1","","15","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of them is known as the canonical pathway and the other one is the mirtron pathway. This pathway depends on splicing rather than any enzyme. As the mirtron pathway is recently discovered, their identification is quite challenging due to less number of annotations. So the identification of mirtrons can be quite productive in understanding their functionality. Several machine learning algorithms have been introduced over the years based mostly upon calculated feature selection which produced good classification performance. We have also seen that neural networks like convolutional neural networks (CNN) applied on modified nucleotide sequences have given better performance. In this paper, we introduced an improved mixed convolutional neural network with multiple different sized filters and max-pooling layers using binary ""one-hot"" encoding and padding. We also used k-fold cross-validation and grid search to choose the values of hyperparameters. As we know neural networks tend to extract features automatically, our model did the same in the convolution and max-pooling layers. We evaluated our model in an independent test set and the results were quite satisfactory. We think our model can be used to predict mirtrons from nucleotide sequences. Even though we tried our best to fine-tune our model, we believe there's still room for improvement as CNN involves tuning of a number of hyperparameters.

Motivated with this, we compute the security score for each common vulnerability of IoT devices within three primary IoT domains (i.e., healthcare, commerce, and home-automation) using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) method. Specifically, IoT devices within these primary domains are isolated and analyzed for common vulnerabilities to generate quantitative and qualitative scores using the CVSS exploitability, impact, and scope metrics.

Users can simply walk up to their vehicle and once they are in close enough proximity, it unlocks and the user is granted access. However, the convenience of PKES comes at a price; vulnerability to relay attacks and amplified relay attacks. Our proposed method, PKES Forcefield, would protect the user from these attacks without sacrificing any convenience. PKES Forcefield utilizes coordinate tracing and multifactor authentication to secure the user. To add more security to PKES Forcefield, we propose AI integration to construct a profile for each user of the vehicle. This profile will store data on the habits of the user (location, walking speed, time, etc.). Once each user has a profile built from their input data, our system will be able to detect any behaviors that differ from the user's profile (anomalies) and then proper security measures will be taken depending on if the anomaly is considered to be a Low Risk Anomaly or a High Risk Anomaly.","","978-1-7281-5912-6","10.1109/ICSSA48308.2019.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307677","Passive Keyless Entry and Start System;artificial intelligence;CAR security;PKES Forcefield;anomaly detection","Automobiles;Security;Relays;Bluetooth;Machine learning;Communication channels;Wireless communication","artificial intelligence;automobiles;message authentication;road vehicles;security of data","amplified relay attacks;artificial intelligence;PKES security;PKES forcefield;anomaly detection;passive keyless entry and start system;coordinate tracing;multifactor authentication;user security","","","","15","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates whether it is possible to infer from a list of system events the program whose behavior caused the occurrence of these system events. To that end, we model transition probabilities between non-equivalent events and apply the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

These models can be used to assess and mitigate the security risk posed by vulnerabilities and to estimate the resources required to handle the potential security breaches. However, these models have some shortcomings that make it difficult to forecast the vulnerabilities present in a software system precisely. Consideration of the change point problem in modeling the vulnerability discovery process can be one of the possible ways to enhance the forecasting capability of the VDMs. In real situations, the vulnerability discovery rate can be influenced by different factors, such as software age, code size, operational effort, popularity, OS and platform type, known vulnerabilities and their types, and so on. Due to the change in these factors, changes are possible in the vulnerability discovery rate. The time point where such changes occur is known as change point. In this paper, the change point problem is considered in exponential VDM to express the factual vulnerability behavior and to accelerate the forecasting capability. The proposed model is validated using real vulnerability data set reported by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Experimental results show that goodness of fit and forecasting ability of the exponential VDM with change point is better in comparison to exponential VDM without change point.","","978-1-7281-5912-6","10.1109/ICSSA48308.2019.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307672","security;vulnerability;change point;vulnerability discovery model","Security;Data models;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Forecasting;Software systems;Numerical models","security of data;software engineering","vulnerability discovery model security;VDM security;National Vulnerability Database;vulnerability discovery rate;forecasting capability;vulnerability discovery process;software system;security vulnerabilities;change point problem","","1","","36","IEEE","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Any practical solution to this problem will require an easy method to identify and to verify the administration of orally-ingested drugs. Deep learning algorithms were applied to images of drugs in pill form. These images were taken using both a smart phone camera and using a hyperspectral imager based on a low-cost CMOS camera. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, 1, 7SS images were taken using a normal CMOS camera of four common pill types. The images of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen were taken using various backgrounds, image angles, and lighting conditions. The results show over 90% accuracy when the convolutional neural network is trained and tested using only normal camera images. The results improved to 100% when trained and tested using4 baseline “datacubes” taken with a low-cost hyperspectral camera solution; however, due to matrix dimensional differences, a ID CNN was used in this case, while a 2D CNN was used with the normal camera images. Each hyperspectral cube included information from effectively 31 wavebands. With more hyperspectral images to expand the drug training set, this approach would be promising for daily use to quickly identify similar pills in the clinical or home environment as well as in smart phone apps to remotely monitor patient compliance to a drug-based treatment regimen.","","978-1-7281-6652-0","10.1109/NSENS49395.2019.9293996","University of Southern California; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293996","hyperspectral;deep learning;drug identification;patient compliance;low cost","Cameras;Hyperspectral imaging;Drugs;Training;Lighting;Deep learning;Two dimensional displays","biomedical optical imaging;diseases;drugs;feature extraction;image classification;image resolution;image sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;patient treatment;smart phones","normal camera images;orally-administered drugs;patient compliance;drug trials;orally-ingested drugs;deep learning algorithms;smart phone camera;hyperspectral imager;low-cost CMOS camera;7SS images;normal CMOS camera;image angles;low-cost hyperspectral camera solution;hyperspectral images;drug training;drug-based treatment regimen","","","","17","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It makes a large limitation for the gait data collection and analysis. This paper presents a novel wearable human gait analysis system based on flexible circuit and piezoresistive pressure sensors. The insole embedded with 8 pressure sensors is fabricated to collect dynamic resistance varying signals due to the piezoresistive effect. Then the resistance signal is converted to voltage signals with a resistance-voltage conversion circuit board. The wireless transmitter sends the gait data to computer for real-time gait analysis via WIFI chip.

First we have presented the large influence of the probability distribution of random bounded communication delays on the global error of clock synchronization under the general condition of communication in WSNs. Then the information of round-trip delays has been introduced to compensate the clock offset in order to decrease the global error of clock synchronization based on the fact that all the round-trip delays between each pair of sensor nodes can be accurately measured. The characteristics of the round-trip delay are analyzed in the case of bidirectional communication between sensor nodes. The clock offset is compensated by the round-trip delay, and the attenuation factor in the consistency theory is introduced. The combined control can greatly decrease the expectation of the global error, the variance of which is also reduced moderately at the same time. Meanwhile the adjusting amplitude of the clock offset also drops sharply. Finally it has shown that the global error of clock skew compensation is mostly determined by the variance rather than the expectation of random communication delays through simulations for the improved algorithm, while the global steady-state error is largely decided by the expectation of random communication delays.","","978-1-7281-6652-0","10.1109/NSENS49395.2019.9293961","Nanjing Institute of Industry Technology; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293961","","Clocks;Synchronization;Sensors;Delays;Wireless sensor networks;Crystals;Time-frequency analysis","clocks;error statistics;least squares approximations;synchronisation;wireless sensor networks","round-trip delay;clock skew compensation;random communication delays;global steady-state error;clock synchronization;LSTS algorithm;wireless sensor networks;probability distribution;random bounded communication links delays;random bounded communication delays;sensor nodes;bidirectional communication;least square estimation based time synchronization algorithm;clock offset compensation;attenuation factor;consistency theory","","","","16","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), although it has good perception quality, PSNR is lower. So we’ll generate realistic results when both of them are used well. The image quality evaluation (IQA) network is to evaluate the image quality, so as to obtain good PSNR value and perception quality. In this paper, we use image quality assessment network to guide the SISR reconstruction network.

If society can do that, biomass can be continued indefinitely, which makes biomass a renewable source of energy capable of causing far less damage than the traditional fuels society uses today.

First off, GVL is able to be recycled which makes it better for the environment than the fossil fuel alternative or any previous solvent used.

In the highly competitive environment, everyone's time is twenty-four hours a day. No one can have more than one minute. Or less have a minute to go, so if you want to improve your competitiveness, efficient scheduling time is very important, people's daily needs for efficiency are also growing. In the process of moving these vehicles, how to move the same distance with others in less time, this demand and efficiency can also be seen from the tools we now use to produce vehicles (such as tricycles).In the high-precision control system design of the self-balancing vehicle of the tricycle vehicle, in addition to the high-precision inclination sensor to measure the dynamic inclination angle, the steering control has an absolute value encoder to learn the angle of the steering of the tricycle body. More importantly, in addition to the rear axle drive system on the wheel of the tricycle body itself, we also installed a stepper motor to control the balance of the tricycle body, so that the tricycle body can be at a higher speed. Under the steady steering, the tricycle body will not roll over.Dynamic attitude measurement is a very important aspect in the design of high-precision control systems for self-balancing vehicles of tricycle vehicles. Because the motor is an open-loop system, we need to use the tilt sensor for attitude measurement to obtain high-precision angle values, and the obtained angle value and the motor form a closed-loop control system to achieve more precise motor control to control the tricycle body. balance. So we need to measure the angle change very accurately, because a single axial attitude tilt sensor can't meet our requirements, and because there are too many shortcomings, we can't get more accurate values in a dynamic environment, so we use A six-axis sensor that helps us get better precision and precision. Finally, we use the VEKF-based algorithm to eliminate the numerical inaccuracy caused by measuring the dynamic tilt angle, and thus obtain calculate the attitude of the self-balancing tricycle and eliminate the errors generated by the sensor. This algorithm can obtain accurate angle values and can be used in a dynamic environment to enable the self-balancing tricycle dynamic vehicle control system to operate stably.","","978-1-7281-6652-0","10.1109/NSENS49395.2019.9293954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293954","tricycle;KF","Acceleration;Vehicle dynamics;Kalman filters;Accelerometers;Sensors;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamics","acceleration measurement;accelerometers;angular measurement;attitude control;attitude measurement;axles;closed loop systems;control engineering computing;drives;gyroscopes;measurement errors;microsensors;motion control;position control;position measurement;road vehicles;sensors;steering systems;stepping motors;vehicle dynamics;wheels","dynamic attitude estimation;highly competitive environment;efficient scheduling time;tricycles;high-precision control system design;self-balancing vehicle;tricycle vehicle;high-precision inclination sensor;dynamic inclination angle;steering control;tricycle body;dynamic attitude measurement;high-precision control systems;high-precision angle values;closed-loop control system;precise motor control;dynamic environment;dynamic tilt angle;self-balancing tricycle;tricycle dynamic vehicle control system","","","","7","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The estimation of biomass during fermentation usually uses an off-line method, such as optical density at 600 nm (OD600) or the determination of dry cell weight (DCW). Online measurement of biomass via mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has also been published. However, no strict demonstration has been given that biomass measurement by MIR is due to the specific absorption of infrared radiation by cells. Three factors are analyzed about cell absorption, which being: optical sampling theory, spectral absorbance intensity inspection, and PLS regression of cells model. Three aspects lead to the conclusion that the measurement of biomass by MIR is not due to specific absorption by bacteria but rather to a chance correlation with the substrate glutamate in this study. If a chance correlation is present, the biomass can be measured by this indirect method. The most reliable measurement method is still by DCW or OD600.

Our model adjusts generative loss to L1 norm, and perceptual loss is still based on L2 norm. L1 cost function can reduce the coefficients of some features to zero, thus indirectly realizing the selection of features according to the perceptual loss, and obtaining more real texture features. The combination of these two loss functions ensures that the reconstructed results of the model are very close to the target image in terms of spatial features, high-level abstract features and semantic features, overall sensory and image quality. The generating network of our model is based on dense residual structure, and the dense connection of residual-in-residual is used to implement fast and accurate learning of high frequency features of images. The adversarial network is based on the structure of discriminators in DCGAN and WGAN.

However, sample number in sample collection step can be used to ensure population representation in statistics. The sample number is the cornerstone of the robustness of model that should be concentrated on; however, few instructions but some empirical expressions have been given up until now. The factors affecting the sampling accuracy include confidence level, relative standard errors, and relative representation requirements. The required number can be calculated by statistical parameters of population and the required representation. The relative standard error is an important factor related to the statistical parameters of the sample set. For general instructions, the calibration kit should use 100-150 samples, the more the better, but it is not recommended to use more than 200.

In BAEC TRIGA Mark II research reactor, power variation is done by manual movement of control rod by operator. This is a very difficult and time consuming process. In this work, we have proposed an automatic control rod movement system for power control in BAEC TRIGA Mark II research reactor. One group first order perturbation theory is used for calculating partially inserted control rod worth in this system. The developed system places control rods in proper position according to desired power level. Without continuous adjustment, the power level will change due to the reactivity feedback of temperature and fission product poisoning. Our system changes control rods' position according to temperature feedback and reactivity feedback of xenon poisoning. The system has been tested using Proteus simulator for functionality and performance. Simulation results showed that the developed automatic control rod movement system has the potential to be used as a power controller system in BAEC TRIGA Mark II research reactor.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290636","Reactivity;Core criticality;Perturbation theory;Xenon poisoning","Inductors;Xenon;Temperature control;Temperature measurement;Control systems;Neutrons;Temperature sensors","fission reactor design;fission reactor fuel;fission reactor instrumentation;fission reactor safety;fission research reactors;reactivity (fission reactors)","main reactivity controlling element;power variation;BAEC TRIGA Mark II research reactor;power control;partially inserted control rod worth;reactivity feedback;system changes control rods;power controller system;automatic control rod position controller system;automatic control rod movement system;Xenon Poisoning Feedback;fission product poisoning","","","","11","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system can automatically change the operating point of a PV module and feed the output voltage and load current into a computer and can then analyze the results. To change the operating point, a variable load has been developed by using IRF540N MOSFETs. The current drawn by the load is from the PV module, which is controlled by a staircase voltage. The voltage has been developed by a counter and a 16-bit DAC unit. The count value of the counter and hence the voltage level of the staircase is varied by an Arduino-based controlling unit. To get the short-circuit current, the PV module is connected in series with a high ampere power supply, and the voltage across the PV module is conditioned by a difference amplifier and fed to an ADC channel of the controlling unit. The output current of the PV module has been sensed by a Hall current sensor, ACS712, and read by another ADC channel. To make the whole system automatic, a program has been developed using Arduino IDE and loaded into the Arduino board. With the help of this program, the system can measure the current and voltage outputs of a PV module and send the values to a PC. Afterward, this acquired data is processed and the performance of the PV module is obtained. The system has been developed in a laboratory and its performance has been studied. Although, there are some fluctuations in the acquired data, with proper filtration satisfactory performance has been obtained. This instrument can be extensively used to evaluate the performance of a PV module.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290592","Solar PV Module;I-V Characteristics Curve;Hall-Current Sensor;Staircase Voltage Generator;Active Load;Differential Amplifier;Arduino Uno;etc","Pins;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Resistors;Power supplies;MOSFET;Government","counting circuits;data acquisition;differential amplifiers;digital-analogue conversion;microcontrollers;short-circuit currents;solar cells","solar PV modules;variable load;data acquisition system;load current;IRF540N MOSFETs;staircase voltage;DAC unit;Arduino-based controlling unit;short-circuit current;high ampere power supply;ADC channel;difference amplifier;Hall current sensor;ACS712;Arduino IDE;counter;word length 16 bit","","2","","14","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most widely used feature extraction method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied in HSI for dimension reduction. The aim of this paper is to analyze PCA and its different variants Segmented-PCA (SPCA), Folded-PCA (FPCA), and its nonlinear approach Kernel-PCA (KPCA) for effective feature extraction and classification of HSI. Moreover, the noise adjusted methods Minimum Noise fraction (MNF) and its variants segmented MNF is also studied for comparing the feature extraction methods.

The experiment was conducted at low pressure (<; 1atm) and moderately low heat fluxes in nucleate boiling region to facilitate feature detection. Data generated from feature detection by `Speeded Up Robust Feature' algorithm based local interest point detector was then analyzed by statistical techniques. Manipulation of statistical distribution parameter leads to a system-specific stochastic model development. The developed model fairly predicts natural convective boiling and different sub-stages of nucleate boiling including bubbling characteristic offering qualitative information about the boiling condition in appreciably short amount of time.

Manually checking and removing abusive comments from public websites can get tedious, which is undesirable in the present day of technological automation. In this paper, we propose a method to detect abusive comments using Machine Learning algorithms. This paper works not only with Bangla text but also with Bangla-English code-mixed text and transliterated Bangla text. The proposed method involves great amount of preprocessing as a result of people's disregard for correct spelling, grammar and punctuation when it comes to writing comments on the internet. For the dataset, we collected comments from public Facebook pages along with the number of likes they got. For features, we used Unigrams, Bigrams, number of likes, emojis along with their categories, sentiment scores, offensive and threatening words used in the comments, detected using our proposed algorithm, and the number of abusive words in each comment. The aforementioned algorithm can detect profanitypes too.

As a result, their size and user-generated content are growing day-to-day. One of the requirements is to capture such a huge amount of data and analyze them for desired purposes, such as target marketing, recommender system design, open-source intelligence, and cybersecurity. Twitter is one of the most popular social network sites (aka microblogging site) and it is used by almost every person for the news update, information sharing, viral marketing, etc using 280 characters. In this paper, we have applied a text analytics framework to analyze Twitter data at different levels of granularity. One of the distinguishing features of the proposed framework is to exploit both content and structural information for tweets analysis. The proposed framework first models the tweets into a multi-attributed graph, wherein tweets are rep-resented as nodes and inter-tweet relationships are represented as edges. For node labeling, we have used NLP techniques to identify features from tweets, whereas edges are labeled using meta-data (such as hashtags, mentions, followers, etc.) that are common to the tweets connected by the edges. For analyzing the multi-attributed graph, we have considered two algorithms, MAG-Dist and MAG-Sim, to convert the multi-attributed graph into a simple and similarity graph. Finally, we have applied MCL (Markov Clustering) algorithm to cluster the nodes of the multi-attributed graph, each group consisting of a particular subset of tweets representing an event. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach is done on a real dataset crawled from Twitter.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290584","Twitter;Markov Clustering;Granularity;Multi-attributed graph","Social networking (online);Clustering algorithms;Markov processes;Blogs;Mathematical model;Analytical models;Standards","data mining;graph theory;social networking (online);text analysis","data mining framework;social graph generation;easy accessibility;social networking services;user-generated content;target marketing;recommender system design;open-source intelligence;popular social network sites;microblogging site;information sharing;viral marketing;text analytics framework;Twitter data;structural information;tweets analysis;multiattributed graph;inter-tweet relationships;meta-data;similarity graph","","2","","23","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose two types of ultrasonic sensor array are designed on prototype basis using HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors. The time of flight (TOF) variations of the sensors are considered as the features for the recognition unit. The objects are kept at a fixed distance from the sensor array to measure the TOF. The TOF of different sensors varies with the different object's shape. The two tools of ANN named `Function Fitting' and `Pattern Recognition' are used as shape recognition unit. These tools are trained with particular objects data. During the testing phase, the previously trained neural networks are recalled to detect the desired shape of the objects. Based on the detection results of two ANN tools a comparative study is redacted between the hexagonal sensor array and 3x3 sensor array. The study observed that, the 3x3 sensor array under `Function Fitting' tool gives the better result of shape detection. Moreover, this system avoids the complexity of signal conditioning algorithm and circuitry. It can be incorporated within a smart device to aid the blind people if this system is fine-tuned properly.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290607","Artificial neural network;function fitting;pattern recognition;time of flight;shape detection","Sensor arrays;Acoustics;Shape;Robot sensing systems;Training;Tools;Biological neural networks","feedforward neural nets;handicapped aids;object recognition;sensor arrays;shape recognition","ultrasonic sensor array;HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors;TOF;shape recognition unit;particular objects data;trained neural networks;hexagonal sensor array;shape detection;object shape recognition;artificial neural network;basic shape;ANN tools;function fitting tool;blind people aid;smart device","","","","14","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the better living of the people of a country, it needs to solve the problem related to garbage management and treatment. Overflow and improper dumping of garbage can cause different exaggerated diseases for neighbouring people, and if the garbage is not treated properly it can also cause some serious environmental pollution. This paper proposed a system of garbage management which can monitor the garbage level, the humidity, the temperature and can sense the response of flame. To ensure the clearance of the garbage, radio frequency identification (RFID) system is installed and with the help of Internet of Things (IoT) all the system can be monitored from the server by the authority. Two types of communication protocol are used here one is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, and the other is Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology which is used as a backup. After collecting all the garbage from individual bins, they have to be dumped centrally, and machine learning model is used here to segregate the garbage into biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The whole procedure is ensuring a smart garbage system with proper treatment and green and pollution-free environment which is crying need for the people of Bangladesh.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290551","IoT;RFID;MQTT;Waste Segregation;Smart Garbage Collection Monitoring;Arduino Uno;ESP8266;LoRa;Machine Learning","Sensors;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Protocols","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;radiofrequency identification;telemetry;waste management","garbage level;radio frequency identification system;smart garbage system;Bangladesh;smart garbage management;proper treatment system;IoT;RFID system;Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol;MQTT protocol;communication protocol;Long Range Wide Area Network technology;LoRaWAN;machine learning model","","3","","11","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the idea of developing an anthropomorphic hand with 15 degrees of freedom and 5 actuators has been elaborated as well as the mechanical design, control system, composition, and peculiarities of the robotic hand have been discussed. The hand has an anthropomorphic appearance and also can perform human-like functionalities, for example, gripping and hand gestures representation. The results reveal that the hand is designed as one part and does not need any kind of assembly and it exhibits an excellent weight lifting capacity, since it is made of flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material, and its elasticity also ensures that the hand is safe for interacting with humans as well. This hand may be used in a humanoid robot as well as a prosthetic hand.

However, HSI contains an enormous amount of information of the scene which is becoming an important field of research, but the ground object identification is a most challenging task for such a high dimensional datacube. Moreover, the spectral bands of HSI are highly correlated in both spatial and spectral contents and suffer from dimensionality problems. As a result, dimensionality reduction is the important preprocessing tasks for the classification. This paper proposed a dimension reduction approach that includes both feature reduction and feature selection for finding a relevant subset of features for efficient HSI classification. Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) is used as a feature extraction method. Feature selection is done using an entropy-based method, cross cumulative residual entropy (CCRE). To estimate the efficiency of detected subsets, kernel support vector machine classifier is employed on two real hyperspectral image data set. The experimental results indicate a noticeable improvement with respect to classification accuracies.

Due to huge number of characters in Unicode, it takes 16 bits to manage the total codes. Each of the language has a block of codes. We describe a technique to compress the 16 bit Unicode Bangla natural text along with English characters by 8-bit encoding. The encoding and decoding schemes consist of two steps. In step1 we replace some frequently used Bangla phrases with the extended ASCII characters and in the second step we assign the ASCII characters by an 8-bit binary value. We create a bit stream by appending the sequence of the binary values that we get after encoding the text. From this bit stream every 16 bit is taken and converted into a Unicode character. It creates an arbitrary sequence of Unicode characters with the values of the encoded bit stream. The scheme guarantees at least 50% compression in the worst case and 63% in the average case. This Unicode character sequence is then stored or transmitted. To decode it, we use the reverse process that was used for encoding. Finally we compare our result with well-known Huffman and LZW algorithm. Experimental result shows the effectiveness of the scheme.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290703","Text compression;Compression ratio;Unicode;Text encoding;Text ranking","Image coding;Encoding;Data compression;Decoding;Streaming media;Dictionaries;Throughput","data compression;encoding;natural language processing;text analysis","English characters;encoding;decoding schemes;frequently used Bangla phrases;extended ASCII characters;binary values;encoded bit stream;Unicode character sequence;efficient compression scheme;text compression;natural language processing community;total codes;Unicode transformation;Unicode Bangla natural text;word length 16.0 bit","","","","15","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As existing energy meters provide very little to no information regarding the energy consumptions of individual appliances apart from the aggregated power rating, the spotting of individual appliances' energy usages by NILM will not only provide consumers the feedback of appliance-specific energy usage but also lead to the changes of their consumption behavior which facilitate energy conservation. B Neenan et al. [2] have demonstrated that direct individual appliance-specific energy usage signals lead to consumers' behavioral changes which improves energy efficiency by as much as 15%. Upon disaggregation of an energy signal, the signal needs to be classified according to the appropriate appliance. Hence, the goal of this paper is to disaggregate total energy consumption data to individual appliance signature and then classify appliance-specific energy loads using a prominent supervised classification method known as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). To perform this operation, we have used a publicly accessible dataset of power signals from several houses known as the REDD dataset. Before applying KNN, data is preprocessed for each device. Then KNN is applied to check whether their energy consumption signature is separable or not. KNN is applied with K=5.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290671","Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM);K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN);Supervised Classification;Energy Consumption Signatures;Appliance Classification;REDD dataset","Performance evaluation;Energy consumption;Training;Monitoring;Microwave ovens;Supervised learning;Microwave theory and techniques","domestic appliances;energy conservation;energy consumption;load monitoring;nearest neighbour methods;power engineering computing;power meters","aggregated power rating;NILM;energy conservation;direct individual appliance-specific energy usage signals;energy efficiency;energy signal;total energy consumption data;appliance-specific energy loads;supervised classification method;K-nearest neighbors;power signals;nonintrusive electrical appliances monitoring;nonintrusive load monitoring;aggregated energy consumption signature;energy meters;KNN;REDD dataset","","12","","18","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, a new multilevel inverter (MLI) based on series-connected switched-sources is presented. The proposed MLI requires less number of sources and switches to produce multilevel output. The cost, size, and maintenance are reduced as well as the performance is improved due to the less number of circuit elements. In addition, the proposed MLI is capable of being connected to the grid according to IEEE standard 519. Renewable energy sources can be connected as the source of this MLI. The operation of this proposed MLI is explained by using a fifteen level inverter and the MLI model was verified by simulating in MATLAB Simulink.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290691","multilevel inverter;grid integration;renewable energy sources","Topology;Switches;Control systems;Renewable energy sources;Power grids;Voltage control;Switching circuits","cost reduction;IEEE standards;invertors;power generation economics;power grids;power system simulation;renewable energy sources","grid integration;renewable energy sources;power generation;RES;multilevel inverter;MLI;series-connected switched-sources;multilevel output;cost reduction;size reduction;IEEE standard 519;MATLAB Simulink","","1","","12","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method is based on two-part: one is for decomposing an input image and another is detecting the color histogram of that input image based on symmetry reflection. The second part of this work is performed by using the Log-Gabor filter. SVD decomposition is an effective way of decomposing an input image correctly. Many image decomposition techniques have been performed based on the SVD method. In this paper, we have proposed a combined way to detect the color histogram and decomposition result of an input image. This proposed method is very efficient for detecting the decompose output of the input image. MATLAB tool is effective to implement the proposed method. The proposed system helps to decompose any input image and also detect its color histogram.","","978-1-7281-6309-3","10.1109/ICIET48527.2019.9290708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290708","image decomposition;SVD;Wavelet;Log-Gabor filter;color histogram","Histograms;Image color analysis;Reflection;Gabor filters;Matrix decomposition;Image edge detection;Image decomposition","feature extraction;Gabor filters;image colour analysis;singular value decomposition;wavelet transforms","image color histogram;wavelet based symmetry reflection;SVD method;input image;SVD decomposition;image decomposition techniques;singular value decomposition;symmetry reflection;MATLAB tool;color histogram detection","","","","20","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
