Ruptures on the kinematically dissimilar faults were activated subsequently from the initial MW 7.2 Sarez event at times and distances that follow a diffusion equation. All main shock areas but the initial one exhibited foreshock activity, which was not modulated by the occurrence of the earlier earthquakes. Modelling of the static Coulomb stress changes indicates that aftershock triggering occurred over distances of ≤90 km on favourably oriented faults. The third event in the sequence, the MW 6.6 Muji earthquake, ruptured despite its repeated stabilization through stress transfer in the order of –10 kPa. To explain the accumulation of MW > 6 earthquakes, we reason that the initial main shock may have increased nearby fault permeability, and facilitated fluid migration into the mature fault zones, eventually triggering the later large earthquakes.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076387","Asia;Earthquake interaction;forecasting and prediction;Seismicity and tectonics;Continental neotectonics;Dynamics: seismotectonics;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The 1999 Kocaeli and Düzce earthquakes emphasize the earthquake potential of the fault, crossing the Sea of Marmara, and the importance of seismic hazards in the region. The studies in the last 20 yr have concentrated on the main fault and its future destructive earthquake potential. In this study, unlike the previous ones, we focus on the two main topics about the earthquakes not interested previously in İstanbul: (1) Investigating recent earthquake activity masked by the blasts in the metropolitan area and its tectonic implications, (2) revealing their effects in İstanbul utilizing numerical ground motion simulations for a future moderate event (Mw 5). First, the 386 earthquakes from 2006 to 2016 are relocated with the double-difference method using the dense seismic network operated in the same period. The source mechanisms of the events (ML ≥ 3), including the most recent 2021 Kartal–İstanbul earthquake (ML 4.1), are determined. In addition to the analysis of the recent seismic activity, the location of the two moderate and pre-instrumental-period İstanbul earthquakes, which occurred in 1923 (Mw 5.5) and 1929 (Mw 5.1), are revised. Using the relocated epicentres outside of the principal deformation zone and the fault plane solutions, the roles of the earthquakes in the stress regime of the Marmara region are explained. The epicentres on the Cenozoic or Palaeozoic formation in the Istanbul–Zonguldak Zone are interpreted as the re-activation of the palaeo-structures under the recent tectonic stresses, and their fault plane solutions agree with the synthetic/antithetic shears of a transtensional regime corresponding to the right lateral strike-slip system with mainly N–S extension in the Marmara Region. In the second part, we investigate the effects of moderate scenario events (Mw 5) considering the current earthquake epicentres in the İstanbul metropolitan area, using characterized earthquake source model and 1-D velocity structure verified with the broad-band (0.1–10 Hz) numerical ground motion simulation of the 2021 Kartal–İstanbul earthquake. The simulated PGAs agree with the ground-motion prediction equations for short epicentral distances (<30 km). Furthermore, according to the empirical relation for Turkish earthquakes, the maximum PGA value of the synthetic models (∼0.3 g) corresponds to the felt intensity of MMI IX. The simulated spectral accelerations for the Mw 5 earthquake scenarios may exceed the design spectrum between 0.2 and 0.6 s given in the Turkish Building Earthquake Code (2018). In addition, certain models also generate spectral accelerations close to the design-level spectrum between 0.4 and 1 s, leading to resonance phenomena. The results indicate that a moderate event (Mw 5) in the İstanbul metropolitan area is capable of damage potential for the mid-rise buildings (4–10 stories) because of the site condition with resonance phenomena and poor construction quality.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076391","Numerical modelling;Earthquake ground motions;Earthquake hazards;Seismicity and tectonics","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We analysed near-field seismic observations using a novel finite-fault inversion method that allows automatic parametrization and teleseismic data from multiple arrays using the MUSIC backprojection (BP) method that enhances imaging resolution. The inverted slip distribution obtained from waveforms filtered in the frequency band of 0.02–0.2 Hz showed that the kinematic rupture propagated along both the strike (∼35 km) and dip directions (∼85 km), and that the large-slip area was located southwest to the hypocentre with a maximum slip of ∼1.03 m. Overall, no obvious frequency-dependent rupture behaviours occurred during the rupture process due to the deep nucleation of the Fukushima earthquake on a heterogeneous fault where sizes of asperities do not monotonically increase with depth, which sheds light on understanding the rupture dynamics of intraplate earthquakes in subduction zones. Both the slip inversion and BP revealed the general rupture feature of this earthquake with southwestward and updip directivity. A comparison of BPs between multiple arrays indicates that the source–receiver geometry and the directivity effect of an earthquake may cause critical discrepancies in BPs of different arrays. From the temporal change of stress around the hypocentre of the 2021 Fukushima earthquake due to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Mw 9.1 earthquake, the long-term dominance of viscoelastic relaxation increased the Coulomb failure function (CFF) by 0.3–0.7 MPa, indicating that the occurrence of the Fukushima earthquake has been likely promoted by the post-seismic deformation due to the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076354","Body waves;Earthquake source observations;Seismicity and tectonics","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Linear arrays are usually deployed for passive surface wave investigations because of their high convenience, and passive surface wave imaging methods commonly used for linear arrays can be grouped as non-interferometric methods (e.g. passive multichannel analysis of surface wave, refraction microtremor) and interferometric methods (e.g. multichannel analysis of passive surface waves and spatial autocorrelation). It is well known that the seismic interferometry method is able to retrieve Green's function between inter-station pairs based on passive seismic data and that is how interferometric methods work. Although non-interferometric methods are also popular and effective in near-surface seismic imaging, particularly in the geotechnical industry, there is no theoretical proof to clarify the accuracy and/or the bias of these methods. In this study, we use numerical derivations and simulations to demonstrate the underlying physics for both non-interferometric and interferometric methods, under two common noise source environments including a homogeneous source distribution and a dominant in-line source distribution. We also prove the strength of interferometric methods for accurate dispersion imaging over the non-interferometric methods, and provide a way to estimate the biases in non-interferometric measurements. Finally, we present comprehensive comparisons between different passive surface wave methods with three typical field examples considering various observation systems.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076389","Seismic interferometry;Seismic noise;Surface waves and free oscillations;Wave propagation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This region was investigated as part of the Canada–Sweden Polar Expedition in 2016, from which two seismic profiles are presented. The first is a 165-km-long line along the crest of the Marvin Spur. The second is a 221-km-long line extending southwestward from the spur to the northern flank of the Alpha Ridge within the Cretaceous High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALIP). Multichannel seismic reflection data were acquired along both lines using a 100-m-long streamer, and the airgun shots were also recorded using 16 sonobuoys and 5 stations on the sea ice to calculate a velocity model for the crust from forward modelling of seismic traveltimes. The Marvin Spur profile reveals up to 1100 m of sedimentary rocks on top of a 1-km-thick series of basalts (4.5–5.1 km s−1). Upper and lower crust have velocities of 5.8–5.9 km s−1 and 6.2–6.3 km s−1, respectively, with the upper crust being 1–2 km thick compared to around 13 km for the lower crust. A wide-angle double seismic reflection manifests the top and base of a 6-km-thick lower crustal layer that we interpret as magmatic underplating beneath the continental crust of the Marvin Spur. We correlate a high-amplitude magnetic anomaly on Marvin Spur with a comparable anomaly on Lomonosov Ridge by invoking 110 km of dextral strike-slip motion. Assuming that HALIP-related magmatic deposits generate these anomalies, the strike-slip motion pre-dates the main phase of magmatism (latest Cretaceous, 78 Ma). On the northern Alpha Ridge, sediments are around 1-km-thick and cover a 700 to 1700-m-thick series of basalts with velocities of 4.4–4.8 km s−1. Below is a 3-km-thick layer with intermediate velocities of 5.6 km s−1 and a lower crust with a velocity of 6.8 km s−1. Moho depth is not resolved seismically, but gravity modelling indicates a total thickness of 13 or 18 km for the igneous crust except for the Fedotov Seamount where Moho deepens by about 5 km. Construction of the seamount occurred in multiple magmatic phases, including flow eruptions during deposition of the Cenozoic sedimentary succession post-dating the main HALIP magmatism.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076393","Gravity anomalies and Earth structure;Arctic region;Controlled source seismology;Continental margins: divergent;Crustal structure","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, LSRTM is computationally expensive and it can suffer from multiple reflections. Recently, a target-oriented approach to LSRTM has been proposed, which focuses the wavefield above the target of interest. Remarkably, this approach can be helpful for imaging below complex overburdens and subsalt domains. Moreover, this approach can significantly reduce the computational burden of the problem by limiting the computational domain to a smaller area. Nevertheless, target-oriented LSRTM still needs an accurate velocity model of the overburden to focus the wavefield accurately and predict internal multiple reflections correctly. A viable alternative to an accurate velocity model for internal multiple prediction is Marchenko redatuming. This method is a novel data-driven method that can predict Green's functions at any arbitrary depth, including all orders of multiples. The only requirement for this method is a smooth background velocity model of the overburden. Moreover, with Marchenko double-focusing, one can make virtual sources and receivers at a boundary above the target and bypass the overburden. This paper proposes a new algorithm for target-oriented LSRTM, which fits the Marchenko double-focused data with predicted data. The predicted data of the proposed method is modelled by a virtual source term created by Marchenko double-focusing on a boundary above the target of interest. This virtual source term includes all the interactions between the target and the overburden. Moreover, the Marchenko double-focused data and the virtual source term are free of multiples generated in the overburden. Consequently, our target-oriented LSRTM algorithm suppresses the multiples purely generated inside the overburden. Our algorithm correctly accounts for all orders of multiples caused by the interactions between the target and the overburden, resulting in a significant reduction of the artefacts caused by the overburden internal multiple reflections and improves amplitude recovery in the target image compared to conventional LSRTM.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076356","Inverse theory;Numerical modelling;Acoustic properties;Controlled source seismology;Wave scattering and diffraction","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This region is particularly suitable for data-driven methodologies as those applied in this work because of the large amount of available data due to the recent multiple main shock–aftershock sequences occurred in this area. Both neGMM and GIT models are developed for Fourier spectra in the frequency range between 0.5 and 25 Hz and using the same reference sites. The comparison of the non-ergodic terms with the source, path and site spectral parameters provides interesting results. First, we find a strong correlation between the source parameters, stress drop Δσ and decay ${k}_{\mathrm{ source}}$ and the source neGMM corrective terms (the combination of the between-event δBe and the location-to-location terms δL2L). This correlation is frequency dependent and, at high frequency, is remarkably positive for Δσ and negative for ${k}_{\mathrm{ source}}$. Concerning the attenuation terms, the path-to-path residuals (δP2P) are clearly associated with the deviations from the regional Q estimates obtained from GIT analysis. This indicates that the neGMM properly captures the properties of the anelastic attenuation and that the corrective terms δP2P can be used to account for differences in travel paths across different crustal domains. Finally, adopting the same reference sites for neGMM and non-parametric GIT, we observe that the systematic site terms (δS2Ss) and the GIT-derived amplification functions are in good agreement. The next step for an appropriate modelling is to identify the physical parameters (e.g. VS,30 and ${k}_0$) describing the empirical amplification curves to be introduced as explanatory variables in the ground motion model.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076360","Central Italy;Computational seismology;Earthquake ground motions;Generalized Inversion Technique;Seismic attenuation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Particularly, the immediate reconstruction of the spatially continuous wavefield is valuable for decision-making of disaster response decisions in the initial phase. For a fast and accurate reconstruction, utilization of prior information is essential. In fluid mechanics, full-state recovery, which recovers the full state from sparse observation using a data-driven model reduced-order model, is actively used. In this study, the framework developed in the field of fluid mechanics is applied to seismic wavefield reconstruction. A seismic wavefield reconstruction framework based on compressed sensing using the data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) is proposed and its characteristics are investigated through numerical experiments. The data-driven ROM is generated from the data set of the wavefield using the singular value decomposition. The spatially continuous seismic wavefield is reconstructed from the sparse and discrete observation and the data-driven ROM. The observation sites used for reconstruction are effectively selected by the sensor optimization method for linear inverse problems based on a greedy algorithm. The proposed framework was applied to simulation data of theoretical waveform with the subsurface structure of the horizontally stratified three layers. The validity of the proposed method was confirmed by the reconstruction based on the noise-free observation. Since the ROM of the wavefield is used as prior information, the reconstruction error is reduced to an approximately lower error bound of the present framework, even though the number of sensors used for reconstruction is limited and randomly selected. In addition, the reconstruction error obtained by the proposed framework is much smaller than that obtained by the Gaussian process regression. For the numerical experiment with noise-contaminated observation, the reconstructed wavefield is degraded due to the observation noise, but the reconstruction error obtained by the present framework with all available observation sites is close to a lower error bound, even though the reconstructed wavefield using the Gaussian process regression is fully collapsed. Although the reconstruction error is larger than that obtained using all observation sites, the number of observation sites used for reconstruction can be reduced while minimizing the deterioration and scatter of the reconstructed data by combining it with the sensor optimization method. Hence, a better and more stable reconstruction of the wavefield than randomly selected observation sites can be realized, even if the reconstruction is carried out with a smaller number of observations with observation noise, by combining it with the sensor optimization method.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076358","Inverse theory;Earthquake ground motions;Site effects;Waveform inversion;Wavefield reconstruction: reduced-order model;Compressed sensing","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In order to characterize the contribution of slip to the overall damage process, we conduct triaxial cyclic loading experiments on Westerly granite, and monitor volumetric strain and elastic wave velocity and anisotropy. Cyclic loading tests show large hysteresis in axial stress–strain behaviour that can be explained entirely by slip. Elastic wave velocity variations are observed only past a yield point, and show hysteresis with incomplete reversibility upon unloading. Irrecoverable volumetric strain and elastic wave velocity drop and anisotropy increase with increasing maximum stress, are amplified during hydrostatic decompression, and decrease logarithmically with time during hydrostatic hold periods after deformation cycles. The mechanical data and change in elastic properties are used to determine the proportion of mechanical work required to generate tensile cracks, which increases as the rock approaches failure but remains small, up to around 10 per cent of the net dissipated work per cycle. The pre-rupture deformation behaviour of rocks is qualitatively compatible with the mechanics of wing cracks. While tensile cracks are the source of large changes in rock physical properties, they are not systematically associated with significant energy dissipation and their aperture and growth is primarily controlled by friction, which exerts a dominant control on rock rheology in the brittle regime. Time-dependent friction along pre-existing shear interfaces explains how tensile cracks can close under static conditions and produce recovery of elastic wave velocities over time.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076362","Elasticity and anelasticity;Friction;Geomechanics;Rheology: crust and lithosphere","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To obtain reliable inversion analysis results, we need to use as much data as possible, ranging over different periods. In this study, we improved the previously developed CMT data inversion method to incorporate preceding inversion analysis results into the present analysis as direct prior information about the stress field. The spatial distribution of seismic events and/or their focal mechanisms in a region would change from one period to another, reflecting temporal stress changes there. In the improved inversion method, in addition to the hyperparameter controlling the roughness of stress fields, we introduced another hyperparameter that controls the relative weight of direct prior information to the observed data to be analysed. The relative weights of direct and indirect prior information to the observed data are appropriately determined by using Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion. We applied the improved inversion method to the observed CMT data of seismic events of 24 yr (1997−2020) in northeast Japan, where the Tohoku-oki megathrust event (Mw 9.0) occurred on 11 March 2011 at the North American–Pacific Plate boundary. To investigate temporal changes in tectonic stress orientation, we divided the target period into the inter-, pre- and post-seismic periods of the megathrust event: P1 (January 1997−January 2007), P2 (February 2007−February 2011), and P3 (March 2011−December 2020). According to successive inversion analysis results for P1 and P2, we confirmed that the tectonic stress orientation was stable for 14 yr before the megathrust event. On the other hand, successive inversion analysis results for P2 and P3 indicated a possibility that the 2011 megathrust event caused significant changes in tectonic stress orientation in three regions. However, two of them were negative in the quantitative evaluation of the reliability of detected temporal changes.

We observe clear S410S, S520S, S660S and P410P precursor arrivals, but not P660P, because of interfering phases. Traveltimes and amplitudes of precursor phases reflect a complex interplay of data and modelling factors, implying that MTZ structure is best resolved through direct inversion of waveforms. To model waveforms as accurately as possible, we account for effects arising from data processing, shallow structure, incoherent stacking, attenuation and source effects, among others. As part of the inversion, we consider two independent model parametrizations to obtain quantitative insights into the seismic and thermochemical constitution of the MTZ. These include a ‘classical’ seismic parametrization based on a layered seismic velocity structure and a thermodynamic parametrization, where seismic profiles are self-consistently built from mineral physics data. The results show lateral variations in thermal, compositional and discontinuity structure that partly correlate with tectonic setting. The mantle beneath continents and subduction zones is found to be colder in comparison to oceans and hotspots as reflected in MTZ thickness. In terms of composition, we find that subduction zones are enriched in basalt. Mid-MTZ structure shows a trend from simple sub-ocean single- to complex circum-Pacific subduction-zone-related dual-discontinuity structure—the possible signature of oceanic crustal transport to the MTZ. Statistical analysis indicates that a mechanically mixed mantle matches seismic data better than an equilibrated mantle across ∼2/3 of the globe. Finally, while a large part of the seismic data can be matched by an iso-chemical and adiabatic mantle, complexities within the MTZ are not entirely captured by this assumption.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076366","Composition and structure of the mantle;Body waves;Surface waves and free oscillations;Waveform inversion;Mantle discontinuities;PP and SS precursors","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Time-series analysis of changing emplacement rates at a range of hotspots finds that these rates vary regularly at periods of a few to several tens of millions of years, indicative of changing melt production within underlying mantle plumes. Many hotspots exhibit at least one period between ∼2 and 10 Myr, consistent with several proposed mechanisms for changing near-surface plume flux, and thus melting rate, such as small-scale convection, solitary waves and instability formation in tilted plume conduits. Here, we focus on quantifying instability growth within plumes tilted by overlying plate motion. Previous studies using fluids with constant or temperature-dependent viscosity suggest that such instabilities should not form under mantle conditions. To test this assertion, we use a modified version of the finite element code ASPECT to simulate 400 Myr of evolution of a whole-depth mantle plume rising through the transition zone and spreading beneath a moving plate. In a 2-D spherical shell geometry, ASPECT solves the conservation equations for a compressible mantle with a thermodynamically consistent treatment of phase changes in the mantle transition zone and subject to either a temperature- and depth-dependent linear rheology or a temperature-, depth- and strain-rate dependent non-linear rheology. Additionally, we examine plume evolution in a mantle subject to a range of Clapeyron slopes for the 410 km (1–4 MPa K–1) phase transitions. Results suggest that plume conduits tilted by >67° become unstable and develop instabilities that lead to initial pulses in the transition zone followed by repeated plume pulsing in the uppermost mantle. In these cases, pulse size and frequency depend strongly on the viscosity ratio between the plume and ambient upper mantle. Based upon our results and comparison with other studies, we find that the range of statistically significant periods of plume pulsing in our models (∼2–7 Myr), the predicted increase in melt flux due to each pulse (3.8–26 × 10−5 km3 km−1 yr−1), and the time estimated for a plume to tilt beyond 67° in the upper mantle (10–50 Myr) are consistent with observations at numerous hotspot tracks across the globe. We suggest that pulsing due to destabilization of tilted plume conduits may be one of several mechanisms responsible for modulating the melting rate of mantle plumes as they spread beneath the moving lithosphere.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076370","Phase transitions;Dynamics: convection currents;and mantle plumes;Mantle processes","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We discussed how to set up the initial stress on a fault before an earthquake based on the Mohr–Coulomb criterion considering depth variation. One can assume that the stress is uniformly loaded without exceeding the Coulomb criterion at any depth (stress-constrained condition); however, this implicitly induces a discontinuity of strain in a 1-D layered Earth model. We alternatively assumed that the strain in an upper layer does not exceed that in a lower layer (strain-constrained condition). We numerically demonstrated the dynamic rupture process through 3-D numerical simulations, particularly for the 2019 Mw 4.9 Le Teil (France) earthquake, showing a very shallow ruptured area with ground surface displacement. The rupture extent and seismogenic depth can be controlled by a limited layer at depth, which is favourably loaded in advance. The lateral extension of the rupture propagation at this layer is necessary to trigger the above layer but not enough to trigger the layers below. The depth variation of stress loading before an earthquake would be important for assessing the rupture size of moderate (magnitude 5–6) crustal earthquakes in particular.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076368","Computational seismology;Earthquake dynamics;Earthquake hazards;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Its very low permeability (10−19 to 10−21 m2) makes it a potential sealing horizon, however the presence of faults that may be activated during the lifetime of a repository project can compromise the long-term hydrological confinement, and lead to mechanical instability. Here, we have performed laboratory experiments to test the effect of relative humidity (RH), grain size (g.s.) and normal stress on rate-and-state frictional properties and stability of fault laboratory analogues corresponding to powders of OPA shaly facies. The sifted host rock powders at different grain size fractions (<63 μm and 63 < g.s. < 125 μm), at room (∼25 per cent) and 100 per cent humidity, were slid in double-direct shear configuration, under different normal stresses (5–70 MPa). We observe that peak friction, μpeak and steady-state friction, μss, depend on water vapour content and applied normal stress. Increasing relative humidity from ∼25 per cent RH (room humidity) to 100 per cent RH causes a decrease of frictional coefficient from 0.41 to 0.35. The analysis of velocity-steps in the light of rate-and-state friction framework shows that the stability parameter (a–b) is always positive (velocity-strengthening), and it increases with increasing sliding velocity and humidity. The dependence of (a–b) on slip rate is lost as normal stress increases, for each humidity condition. By monitoring the variations of the layer thickness during the velocity steps, we observe that dilation (Δh) is directly proportional to the sliding velocity, decreases with normal stress and is unaffected by humidity. Microstructural analysis shows that most of the deformation is accommodated within B-shear zones, and the increase of normal stress (σn) promotes the transition from strain localization and grain size reduction to distributed deformation on a well-developed phyllosilicate network. These results suggest that: (1) the progressive loss of velocity dependence of frictional stability parameter (a–b) at σn > 35 MPa is dictated by a transition from localized to distributed deformation and (2) water vapour content does not affect the deformation mechanisms and dilation, whereas it decreases steady-state friction (μss), and enhances fault stability.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076372","Fault zone rheology;Friction;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting;Microstructures;Rheology and friction of fault zones;Opalinus Clay;Geological repositories","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The energies of horizontal and vertical motion in such a field are proportional to the imaginary part of the corresponding diagonal components of the Green's tensor for coincident source and receiver. Given this remarkable connection, we examine the partitions of elastic waves due to dynamic horizontal and vertical surface loads in a layered elastic media. The elastic radiation characteristics for horizontally layered media are much more complicated than for the homogeneous half-space. While the corresponding power partitions of the different types of waves in a half-space do not vary with respect to frequency, even in an elastic medium consisting of layers over a half-space, the modal structure shows strong variations in the frequency, mainly around the main peak and the minimum of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR). Using a test model with a moderately high impedance contrast, we find that most of the energy density of the horizontal displacements is concentrated in the fundamental mode of the Love waves, reaching ∼80 per cent of the power in the horizontal components. The vertical displacement of the P-SV body waves reaches a maximum of ∼85 per cent, while the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves reaches a maximum of ∼99 per cent of the available power in the vertical motion. With this analysis, it is possible to analyse the multimodal effects in the dispersion diagrams and explicitly relate the partition of the energy density with the dispersion curves and the HVSR under the diffuse field assumption.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076374","Body waves;Surface waves and free oscillations;Wave propagation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

P- and S-wave quality factors (Q), whose inverse represent a measure of attenuation, depend on reservoir rock and pore fluid properties, in particular, saturation, permeability, porosity, fluid viscosity and lithology; however, these quality factors are rarely taken into account in seismic AVO inversion. For this reason, in this work, we aim to integrate quality factors derived from physically based models in AVO inversion by proposing a gradient descent optimization-based inversion technique to predict the unknown model properties (P- and S-wave velocities, the related quality factors and density). The proposed inversion minimizes the non-linear least-squares misfit with the observed data. The optimal solution is iteratively obtained by optimizing the data misfit using a second-order limited-memory quasi-Newton technique. The forward model is performed in the frequency–frequency-angle domain based on a convolution of broad-band signals and a linearized viscoelastic frequency-dependent AVO (FAVO) equation. The optimization includes the adjoint-state-based gradients with the Lagrangian formulation to improve the efficiency of the non-linear seismic FAVO inversion process. The inversion is tested on synthetic seismic data, in 1-D and 2-D, with and without noise. The sensitivity for seismic quality factors is evaluated using various rock physics models for seismic attenuation and quality factors. The results demonstrate that the proposed inversion method reliably retrieves the unknown elastic and an-elastic properties with good convergence and accuracy. The stability of the inverse solution especially seismic quality factors estimation relies on the noise level of the seismic data. We further investigate the uncertainty of the solution as a function of the variability of the initial models.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076376","Inverse theory;Joint inversion;Numerical modelling;Seismic attenuation;Rock physics and AVO inversion;Marine geosciences and applied geophysics","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The samples are made of illite and red montmorillonite in a parallel and perpendicular disposition (with respect to the applied electric field). Another sample is a homogeneous mixture composed of the same volumetric fraction of illite and red montmorillonite. For all the samples, the polarization is dominated by the red montmorillonite, given by the shape of the spectra (presence or lack of a peak at a particular frequency). We compared the experimental data with classical mixing laws and complex conductance network models to test how to better predict the SIP signature of such mixtures when the SIP spectra of the two components are known. The real conductivity is better predicted by the mixing laws, but the shape of the spectra (presence of polarization peaks at particular frequencies) is best predicted by the conductance network models. This study is a step forward towards a better characterization of heterogeneous clay systems using SIP.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076380","Electrical properties;Hydrogeophysics;Electrical anisotropy;Electromagnetic theory;Numerical modelling","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

AEM data inversion is extremely time-consuming when huge volumes of observational data are involved. Forward modelling is an essential part and represents a large proportion of computational cost in the inversion process. In this study, we develop an AEM simulator using deep learning as a computationally efficient alternative to accelerate 1-D forward modelling. Inspired by Google's neural machine translation, our AEM simulator adopts the long short-term memory (LSTM) modules with an encoder–decoder structure, combining the advantages in time-series regression and feature extraction. The well-trained LSTM network describes directly the mapping relationship between resistivity models with transceiver altitudes and time-domain AEM signals. The prediction results of the test set show that 95 per cent of the relative errors at most sampling points fall in the range of ±5 per cent, with average values within the range of ±0.5 per cent, indicating an overall prediction accuracy. We investigate the effects of the distributions of both resistivity and transceiver altitude in the training set on the prediction accuracy. The LSTM-based AEM simulator can effectively handle the resistivity characteristics involved in the training set and yields great sensitivity to the variations of transceiver altitudes. We also examine the adaptability of our AEM simulator for discontinuous resistivity variations. Synthetic tests indicate that the application effect of the AEM simulator relies on the completeness of the training samples and suggest that enriching the sample diversity is necessary to ensure the prediction accuracy, in cases of observation environments dominated by extreme transceiver altitudes or under-represented geological features. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of network configuration on its accuracy and computational efficiency. Our simulator can deliver ∼13 600 1-D forward modelling calculations within 1 s, which significantly improves the simulation efficiency of AEM data.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076378","Electromagnetic theory;Non-linear electromagnetics;Neural networks;fuzzy logic;Numerical modelling;Time-series analysis","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The role of macroscale flaw(s) as controlling structure has been generally neglected. Here, we conduct detailed characterizations of the acoustic emission (AE) from the rock fracture process on the pre-flawed specimens under loading. Though the same phenomena from the literature can be reproduced within our tests, detailed spatial-temporal investigation on the AE events at the nucleation point suggests a different physical interpretation. Artificial flaw(s) play a non-negligible role as a controlling structure for the following rock fracture process including a series of nucleation points alteration via stress transfer. The interlocking parallelogram (IP) control and single-large-structural (SLS) control are two fundamental mechanisms initiated by the artificial flaws. Each of these two mechanisms are observed under a wide range of flaw settings and can potentially coexist within the across length scales. The scale-invariance feature is observed to be fundamentally different within the scale of specimens under SLS and/or IP control, suggesting the incompleteness at the specimen-scale for IP control. Therefore, no ‘fracture coalescence’ zone can be separately investigated without considering its external rock fracture evolution and confirming scale-invariance.

Seismic anisotropy is the most direct way to infer mantle flow as well as melt distribution, yet the convection patterns associated with plume-like mantle upwelling are understudied due to limited seismic data coverage. Here, we investigate seismic anisotropy beneath the Madeira and Canary hotspots using a dense set of shear wave splitting observations and combining teleseismic and local events recorded by three-component broad-band and short-period seismic stations. Using a total of 26 stations in the Madeira archipelago and 43 stations around the Canary Islands, we obtain 655 high-quality measurements that reveal heterogeneous flow patterns. Although local event results are sparse around most islands, we can observe a small average of S-wave splitting times of 0.16 ± 0.01 s, which significantly increase with source depth beneath El Hierro (>20 km) and Tenerife (>38 km) up to 0.58 ± 0.01 and 0.47 ± 0.05 s. This suggests an influence of melt pocket orientation in magma reservoirs developed at uppermost-mantle depths. Likewise, anisotropy increases significantly beneath the islands with shield stage volcanism (up to 9.81 ± 1.78 per cent at El Hierro, western Canaries, against values up to 1.76 ± 0.73 per cent at Lanzarote, eastern Canaries). On average, teleseismic SKS-wave splitting delay times are large (2.19 ± 0.05 s), indicating sublithospheric mantle flow as the primary source for anisotropy in the region. In the Canaries, the western islands show significantly smaller average SKS delay times (1.93 ± 0.07 s) than the eastern ones (2.25 ± 0.11 s), which could be explained by destructive interference above the mantle upwelling. Despite complex patterns of fast polarization directions throughout both regions, some azimuthal pattern across close stations can be observed and related to present-day mantle flow and anisotropy frozen in the lithosphere since before 60 Ma. Additionally, we infer that the current presence of a mantle plume beneath the archipelagos leads to the associated complex, small-scale heterogeneous anisotropy observations.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076386","Composition and structure of the mantle;Composition and structure of the oceanic crust;Seismic anisotropy;Dynamics: convection currents;and mantle plumes;Hotspots","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The operations of removing noise and gating out signal phases improved signal coherence across array records and provided clear P wave onsets on horizontal records, which can mitigate phase picking error and resulting event location uncertainty.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076390","Wavelet transform;Seismic noise;Wave propagation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

DFDM decomposes the modelling domain into multiple elements that can have arbitrary sizes. When large elements are used, the proposed method closely resembles the finite-difference method because the wavefield is updated using operations involving band diagonal matrices only. Thus DFDM is computationally efficient. When smaller elements are used, DFDM looks closer to the finite-element or the spectral element methods and permits to mesh complicated structures. A complete multidomain algorithm for modelling elastic wave propagation in arbitrarily heterogeneous media is presented. The algorithm's stability is discussed, and the usual Courant condition governs the stability of the proposed scheme. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm accurately accounts for free surfaces, solid–fluid interfaces and accommodates non-conformal meshes in their basic form. Seismograms obtained using the proposed method are compared to those computed using analytical solutions and the spectral element method. To achieve comparable accuracy, DFDM requires fewer points per wavelength than the spectral element method, for example.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076353","Numerical modelling;Computational seismology;Wave propagation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, existing global anisotropic tomography models are not consistent, particularly in the lower mantle. Therefore, the interpretation of seismic anisotropy in terms of mantle dynamics and evolution remains difficult. While surface and body waves are commonly used to build radially anisotropic tomography models, they provide heterogeneous data coverage and the radial anisotropy structure retrieved using these data may be biased by the use of imperfect crustal corrections. Normal modes, the free oscillations of the Earth, automatically provide global data coverage and their sensitivity to shear wave (vs) and compressional wave (vp) velocity makes them suitable to study both vs and vp anisotropy in the mantle. In this study, we assess whether current normal mode splitting data have sufficient sensitivity to lower mantle anisotropy to potentially constrain it. We consider the uncertainties in the data and the effect of inaccuracies in crustal thickness corrections and the assumed scaling between vp and vs. We perform forward modelling of normal mode data using six different 3-D global radially anisotropic tomography models to document how strong and widespread anisotropy has to be to be observable in current normal mode data. We find that, on average 50% of the spheroidal and 55% of the toroidal modes investigated show significant sensitivity to vs anisotropy, while roughly 57% of the spheroidal modes also have strong sensitivity to vp anisotropy. Moreover, we find that the normal mode data fit varies substantially for the various anisotropic tomography models considered, with the addition of anisotropy not always improving the data fit. While we find that crustal thickness corrections do not strongly impact modes that are sensitive to the lower mantle, we observe a trade-off between radial anisotropy and vp scaling for these modes. As long as this is taken into consideration, our findings suggest that existing normal mode data sets can provide valuable information on both vs and vp anisotropy in the mantle.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076388","Composition and structure of the mantle;Tomography;Seismic anisotropy;Surface waves and free oscillations;Theoretical seismology","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Usually, the topography is assumed to have negligible effect on the resulting models. This, however, might not be proper in regions with large topographic variation, such as plateau edges, submarine slopes and volcanic islands. In this study, we use synthetics from waveform-based numerical simulation to quantify the topography effect on ANT in the Longmen Shan area, eastern Tibetan Plateau margin. Three kinds of models are used in forward simulation to obtain theoretical waveforms, including Case1: the layered model, Case2: the layered model with topographic variation and Case3: the flattened model of Case2. The final inversion results show that the bias of ANT is negligible in the blocks with relatively flat topography, such as the interior regions of the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin. However, for the Longmen Shan boundary zone with significant topographic variation (∼4 km), the shear wave velocity image has an obvious negative bias that can reach up to −4 per cent. The maximum depth of bias is ∼5 km, which is mirrored with the maximum topographic elevation difference of the region, and the average bias disappears as the depth decreases to the surface (0 km) or increases to three times of the maximum influence depth (∼15 km). The horizontal distribution of the tomographic bias is almost linearly related to the topographic elevation difference with a slope of −1.04 and a correlation coefficient of 0.90 at maximum influence depth. According to this first-order correction formula and the decreasing trend of average bias with depth, the topography effect on ANT can be suppressed to a certain extent.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076355","Numerical modelling;Waveform inversion;Seismic tomography;Surface waves and free oscillations","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

And weak anisotropy parameters play an important role in the fracture prediction of shale reservoirs. However, the low contribution of the anisotropic parameters to the reflection coefficient and too many condition numbers of forward solver lead to insufficient inversion stability of the anisotropic parameters. Therefore, a new azimuthal-amplitude-difference inversion method with the azimuth-velocity-anisotropic constraints is proposed to improve the stability of inversion and obtain a reasonable estimation of anisotropic parameters. The azimuthal amplitude difference AVAZ forward solver in the anisotropic medium is initially established from a rewritten approximate reflectivity equation and variable substitution. Sensitivity analysis of estimated parameters of the rewritten approximate reflectivity indicates that our approach is sufficiently suitable for seismic inversion of anisotropic parameters. Furthermore, an azimuthal amplitude difference Bayesian AVAZ inversion approach with azimuth-velocity-anisotropic constraint is developed to improve the stability of the inversion. We add Gaussian noise to the synthetic seismic records and assume the Cauchy distributions as a prior constraint on the model parameters. The anisotropic information obtained from the azimuth-velocity-anisotropic inversion is utilized as a constraint for improving the stability of inversion. Synthetic data tests reveal that the anisotropic parameters can be estimated stably even with moderate noise. Field data tests illustrate the feasibility and reliability of the presented inversion method for estimating anisotropic parameters in a shale reservoir with vertical or near-vertical fractures.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076394","Inverse theory;Seismic anisotropy;Fractures;faults;and high strain deformation zones;Amplitude","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thunder-induced seismic waves from four local thunder events are analysed. A theory is introduced for the inversion of acoustic source spectra from thunder-induced seismic waves. In the course of source-spectral inversion, the propagation and acoustic-to-seismic coupling effects are counted. The thunder-induced seismic signals were well identified at distances of <∼20 km. Direct acoustic-to-seismic coupled seismic waves present apparent phase velocities of sound speed in atmosphere (340 m s−1). Thunder-induced seismic waves are dominant at high frequencies (>20 Hz). Vertical peak ground accelerations of thunder-induced seismic waves in local regions (0.024–0.110 m s−2 at distances of 2.4–3.7 km) are equivalent to the ground motion levels induced by a moderate-size (∼M5) earthquake at regional distances. The thunder-induced acoustic waves in the atmosphere are obtained by removing the acoustic-to-seismic coupling effect and site-response effect from the observed thunder-induced seismic waves. The quality factors for acoustic wave attenuation in the atmosphere are determined. Urban landscapes and atmospheric effects cause strong acoustic attenuation over atmospheric absorption. Acoustic thunder source spectra are determined by stacking the inverted acoustic spectra at all stations. The peak frequencies of acoustic thunder source spectra are around 34–36 Hz, suggesting the acoustic energy per unit length in lightning strikes to be ∼4 × 106 J m−1.

The phenomenon of shear wave splitting in a transversely isotropic model with a horizontal symmetry axis (HTI) provides information for inversion. However, the involvement of shear waves makes the computation of forward modelling and inversion more time-consuming than when only using Pwaves. Most studies of traveltime approximation based on the eikonal equation are based on an acoustic assumption, which does not work for shear waves. Therefore, based on perturbation theory, we derive approximate solutions of the eikonal equation in a heterogeneous elastic HTI model for P, SV and SH waves to improve the traveltime computation efficiency. The approximate solutions of linear, quadratic and Shanks forms are based on the linearization of the traveltime function in terms of fracture weaknesses in an isotropic background, which are suitable for joint P-, SV- and SH-wave traveltime inversion and tomography for fracture parameters. When applied for a homogenous model, the proposed formulation results in a simple and accurate traveltime approximation. The first- and second-order perturbation coefficients are used to analyse the sensitivity of the traveltime to fracture weakness. To improve the accuracy of our approximation, we also expand the approximation of the P-wave traveltime with respect to the anellipticity parameter η in an elliptic background, which is evaluated by performing an error test. Based on the accuracy and stability of the perturbation, we select a set of linear equations with respect to the fracture weaknesses and a set of more accurate nonlinear equations to serve different needs.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076361","Numerical approximations and analysis;Body waves;Seismic anisotropy;Eikonal solver;HTI model","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As seismoelectric signals are sensitive to porous medium properties, such as the water saturation, salinity, porosity and permeability, they have good potential for imaging the structure and estimating underground parameters. In this study, we proposed an inversion method for estimating the salinity using coseismic electric fields generated by electrokinetic effects. The method was established by waveform matching between synthetic and observed coseismic electric signals based on a horizontally layered model. We used an L1 norm measure to construct the regularization term and achieve a high-resolution layer interface. Subsequently, we applied the first-order Taylor expansion to estimate the sensitivity and used logarithm transformation to constrain the range of parameters and reduce the solution space. Finally, we used an iteratively reweighted least-squares method to solve the final Gauss–Newton-type inversion function in each iteration to obtain the model update until the inversion converged. Numerical experiments were conducted to test the resolution, anti-noise ability and stability of the inversion algorithm. These results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recover the salinity structure, which broadens the application of seismoelectric effects. We further applied the method to the Mw 6.5 Jiuzhaigou earthquake in 2017 and used the observed coseismic electric field to estimate the salinity and conductivity beneath the station.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076359","Electrical properties;Electromagnetic theory;Waveform inversion;Earthquake ground motions","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The geometric factor is derived by fitting the measured formation factor from a large published data set of 111 clean sandstone samples, and is found to decrease exponentially with rock porosity. Comparison with laboratory data sets of various artificial and real clean sandstones shows that the modified DEM model improves the modelling results and fits satisfactorily the measured formation factor with varying porosity. The results illustrate the practical applicability of the developed closed-form model for the improved simulation of electrical properties of clean granular rocks, and suggest grain contact as a potential link for the joint elastic-electrical characterization of granular rocks through integrated seismic and electromagnetic surveys.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076363","Composition and structure of the core;Electrical properties;Microstructure;Differential effective medium model;Granular rocks","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This is matched with a comprehensive compilation of metadata parameters related to instrumentation and environmental properties for each station. We systematically investigate the similarity of noise spectra by grouping them according to these metadata parameters to determine which factors are the most important in determining noise characteristics. We find evidence for improvements in similarity of noise properties when grouped across parameters, with groupings by seismometer type and deployment water depth yielding the most significant and interpretable results. Instrument design, that is the entire deployed package, also plays an important role, although it strongly covaries with seismometer and water depth. We assess the presence of traditional sources of tilt, compliance, and microseismic noise to characterize their relative role across a variety of commonly used seismic frequency bands. We find that the presence of tilt noise is primarily dependent on the type of seismometer used (covariant with a particular subset of instrument design), that compliance noise follows anticipated relationships with water depth, and that shallow, oceanic shelf environments have systematically different microseism noise properties (which are, in turn, different from instruments deployed in shallow lake environments). These observations have important implications for the viability of commonly used seismic analysis techniques. Finally, we compare spectra and coherences before and after vertical channel tilt and compliance noise removal to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of these now standard processing techniques.

Understanding chemical fate and transport in the CF is significant, however, biogeochemical dynamics at the CF are poorly understood because of the difficulty to measure representatively with high spatio-temporal resolution at depths under dynamic hydrologic regimes. Hydrogeophysics is a developing field that uses minimally intrusive and quick response methods to monitor hydrological properties. Two geoelectrical methods [spectral induced polarization (SIP) and self-potential (SP)], which are sensitive to the solid–liquid interfaces (SIP) and biogeochemical processes (SP) can address the above difficulty. The challenge lies on linking the geoelectrical responses with biogeochemical processes, where many different processes contribute to the signals. We conducted a soil column experiment under five hydrologic regimes focusing on nitrogen transformations with SIP and SP measurements: (1) a static regime with a stable water level; (2) an infiltration regime with periodic pulse infiltration events with a constant water level and (3) fluctuating regimes with water level fluctuations under three drying-wetting frequencies (6/12/18-day-cycle). This is the first large lab-scale work in a well-controlled and highly instrumented soil column. The dynamic hydrologic conditions stimulated complex biogeochemical processes at the CF, and therefore the SIP and SP signals result from many physical and biogeochemical processes. Therefore, we relied on statistical analysis in this study for a novel interpretation. Spearman correlation analysis supported water content played the most important role in real conductivity (σ′) dynamics in the vadose zone, whereas fluid conductivity dominated σ′ in the saturated zone. Both correlation analysis and spatial moment analysis implicated that water content was the driving factor for both σ′ and imaginary conductivity (σ″). A multiple linear regression model indicated the gradient of redox potential, the gradient of soil matric potential and water content were the three main influencing factors for the SP signals. We proposed that the water level fluctuation can efficiently facilitate microbial electron transfer through ions transport between the different redox zones, and aggregate redox processes to create SP signal gradients. Depth zonation analysis, using six environmental indexes (Eh and nitrogen species; water content; real conductivity; imaginary conductivity; SP signal; microbial community composition), suggested that water content induced by soil hydrology was the most dominant factor, captured by all the indexes. In turn, it led to indirect inference on biogeochemical processes and resultant geoelectrical signals. Applying geoelectrical methods to such biogeochemical processes will not only lead to a better understanding of the mechanistic meanings of the geoelectrical signals, but also build relationships between geoelectrical signals and biogeochemical parameters to facilitate a novel way to monitor biogeochemical processes.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076367","Hydrogeophysics;Electrical properties;Statistical methods;Hotspots;Drying-wetting;Water level fluctuation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The deep crustal structure can be studied using a suite of seismological techniques such as receiver function analysis, body and surface wave tomography. Using models of crustal structure derived from these methods, it is possible to delineate tectonic boundaries and regions that may have been affected by similar processes. However, often velocity models are grouped in a somewhat subjective manner, potentially meaning that some geological insight may be missed. Cluster analysis, based on unsupervised machine learning, can be used to more objectively group similar velocity profiles and, thus, put additional constraints on the deep crustal structure. In this study, we apply hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the shear wave velocity profiles obtained by previous studies focused on the region from the joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersion data at 59 sites surrounding the Hudson Bay. This location provides an ideal natural laboratory to study the Precambrian tectonic processes, including the 1.8Ga Trans-Hudson Orogen. We use Ward linkage to define the distance between clusters, as it gives the most physically realistic results, and after testing the number of clusters from 2 to 10, we find there are 5 main stable clusters of velocity models. We then compare our results with different inversion parameters, clustering schemes (K-means and GMM), as well as results obtained for profiles from receiver functions in different azimuths and find that, overall, the clustering results are consistent. The clusters that form correlate well with the surface geology, crustal thickness, regional tectonics and previous geophysical studies concentrated on specific regions. The profiles in the Archean domains (Rae, Hearne and Superior) are clearly distinguished from the profiles in regions influenced by Proterozoic orogenic events (Southern Baffin Island and Ungava Peninsula). Further, the crust of Melville Peninsula is found to be in the same cluster as the crust of the western coast of Ungava Peninsula, suggesting a similar crustal structure. Our study shows the promising use of unsupervised machine learning in interpreting deep crustal structures to gain new geological insights.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076371","Machine learning;Statistical seismology;Structure of the Earth","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Considering the complexity of the field environment, a simulation framework for monitoring gas hydrates with cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography (CHERT) was developed to monitor the hydrate distribution during hydrate formation and dissociation. The simulation study comprised both numerical and physical experiments. The optimal CHERT array was designed through a numerical experiment. The effect of applying CHERT was verified through a physical experiment (a high-resistivity medium and hydrate formation experiment). The results show that improper electrode layouts will lead to varying degrees of low amplitude and blur boundary. An optimal CHERT array of a 100-mm electrode rod spacing, 8-mm electrode ring spacing and 48 electrode rings was obtained. The inversion results obtained using this CHERT array scheme can easily distinguish the distribution of high-resistivity targets and yield satisfactory results in hydrate formation experiments. These findings guarantee data processing and interpretation for applying CHERT in gas hydrate experiments and fields.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076369","Electrical properties;Gas and hydrate system;Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT);Numerical approximations and analysis","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It marks the central section of the left‐lateral Xianshuihe–Xiaojiang Fault System (XXFS), which plays a crucial role in accommodating clockwise vertical-axis rotation of the expanding Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau relative to the South China Block. The area is seismically and tectonically active, and three major active faults—the Anninghe fault (ANHF), Zemuhe fault (ZMHF) and Daliangshan fault (DLSF)—together accommodate a significant amount of left-lateral strike-slip motion. Here, we present a geodetic study of the Daliangshan area mainly based on satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). We processed Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS2) Phased-Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR2) imagery to reconstruct the present-day interseismic deformation field. We developed an optimal atmospherics phase correction strategy to overcome the significant artefacts caused by ionospheric and tropospheric. By applying a multitemporal analysis on corrected interferograms, for the first time we generated a spatially continuous deformation rate field for the Daliangshan area. The satellite line-of-sight (LOS) rate field agrees with Global Positioning System (GPS) and levelling data to ∼2 mm yr–1, confirming that our processing approach is suitable for use in heavily vegetated areas. The InSAR rate map reveals displacements along the central and southern segments of the DLSF and ZMHF. By applying an inversion based on the Okada model, we quantitatively estimated the kinematic parameters of fault segments. Assuming a simple rectangular fault plane for each fault segment and constrained with the prior knowledge of the left-lateral slip, we determined that the ZMHF has a slip rate of 5.06$\pm 0.99{\rm{\ mm}}\,{\rm{yr}}^{-1}$ with a rake angle of ∼$38^\circ $ gently dipping to the SW. The southern section of the DLSF has a rake of $- 48^\circ \,\,{\rm to}\,\, - 41^\circ $ with the total slip rate of $4.93 \pm 0.4{\rm{\ mm}}\,{\rm{yr}}^{-1}$, dipping towards to the NE at $63.50^\circ \pm 2.31^\circ $. The modelled 3-D rate field has been validated with GPS and levelling measurements. Additionally, the inversion model and strain field suggest that the middle section of the DLSF undergoes strong deformation. We considered the implications of three factors—oblique convergence, gravity-driven movement, and the ELIP beneath the Sichuan–Yunnan area—for complex 3-D velocities in the transitional Daliangshan area.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076375","Radar interferometry;Satellite geodesy;Fractures;faults;and high strain deformation zones;Crustal deformation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We propose a full waveform inversion (FWI) algorithm for the prediction of the spatial distribution of CO2 saturation from time-lapse seismic data. The methodology is based on the application of a rock-physics parametrized FWI scheme that allows for direct updating of reservoir properties. We derive porosity and lithology parameters from baseline data and use them as input to predict CO2 saturation from monitor data. The method is tested on synthetic time-lapse data generated for the Johansen formation model. Practical issues associated with field data applications, such as acquisition limitations, construction of the initial model, noise and uncertainty in the rock physics model, are taken into account in the simulation. The results demonstrate the robustness of our approach for reconstructing baseline and monitor models. We also illustrate the potential of the approach as compared to conventional two-step inversion algorithms, in which an elastic FWI prediction of velocities and density is followed by rock physics inversion.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076377","Inverse theory;Numerical approximations and analysis;Waveform inversion","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, simulations of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS) including the complex geometries and heterogeneities of the subsurface are challenging. We present a symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (SIPG) method to perform SEAS simulations accounting for the aforementioned challenges. Due to the discontinuous nature of the approximation, the spatial discretization natively provides a means to impose boundary and interface conditions. The method accommodates 2-D and 3-D domains, is of arbitrary order, handles subelement variations in material properties and supports isoparametric elements, that is, high-order representations of the exterior boundaries, interior material interfaces and embedded faults. We provide an open-source reference implementation, Tandem, that utilizes highly efficient kernels for evaluating the SIPG linear and bilinear forms, is inherently parallel and well suited to perform high-resolution simulations on large-scale distributed memory architectures. Additional flexibility and efficiency is provided by optionally defining the displacement evaluation via a discrete Green's function approach, exploiting advantages of both the boundary integral and volumetric methods. The optional discrete Green's functions are evaluated once in a pre-computation stage using algorithmically optimal and scalable sparse parallel solvers and pre-conditioners. We illustrate the characteristics of the SIPG formulation via an extensive suite of verification problems (analytic, manufactured and code comparison) for elastostatic and quasi-dynamic problems. Our verification suite demonstrates that high-order convergence of the discrete solution can be achieved in space and time and highlights the benefits of using a high-order representation of the displacement, material properties and geometries. We apply Tandem to realistic demonstration models consisting of a 2-D SEAS multifault scenario on a shallowly dipping normal fault with four curved splay faults, and a 3-D intersecting multifault scenario of elastostatic instantaneous displacement of the 2019 Ridgecrest, CA, earthquake sequence. We exploit the curvilinear geometry representation in both application examples and elucidate the importance of accurate stress (or displacement gradient) representation on-fault. This study entails several methodological novelties. We derive a sharp bound on the smallest value of the SIPG penalty ensuring stability for isotropic, elastic materials; define a new flux to incorporate embedded faults in a standard SIPG scheme; employ a hybrid multilevel pre-conditioner for the discrete elasticity problem; and demonstrate that curvilinear elements are specifically beneficial for volumetric SEAS simulations. We show that our method can be applied for solving interesting geophysical problems using massively parallel computing. Finally, this is the first time a discontinuous Galerkin method is published for the numerical simulations of SEAS, opening new avenues to pursue extreme scale 3-D SEAS simulations in the future.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076381","Seismic cycle;Transient deformation;Numerical approximations and analysis;Numerical modelling;Earthquake dynamics;Earthquake interaction;forecasting;and prediction","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The data collected are sufficient for a qualitative investigation of the seismic response of such a complex basin. The measurements were undertaken in the framework of a collaboration between the NSET (National Society for Earthquake Technology, Nepal) and the OGS (National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics, Italy). During the two campaigns, a series of passive seismic surveys were made, taking into consideration both single broad-band sensors and arrays. The 2015 study initially focused on the Lalitpur area (southern part of Kathmandu) and was later extended to the northern and more urbanized area of the capital city of Nepal. The 2018 survey focused on estimating the S-wave velocity field of the entire stratigraphic sequence by array and a repetition of some Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) measurements close to two boreholes with reliable stratigraphy. Two inversion methods, using the data from the seismic arrays, were useful to infer the S-wave velocity profiles of the shallower layers and to interpret some HVSRs. The outcome is a map of the periods of single station data representing the seismic response of the basin. Comparing these results with the strong motion data of the Gorkha 2015 main shock, we confirm that the longer periods are not only the effects of the earthquake source, but also of the local response of the basin itself.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076379","Asia;Body waves;Earthquake hazards;Seismic noise;Site effects","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The method depends on the relative stability of background seismic sources in order to make repeatable measurements of subsurface properties. Such stability is typically assessed by examining the similarity of cross-correlation functions through time. Thus, techniques that can better assess the temporal similarity of cross-correlation functions may aid in discriminating between real subsurface processes and artificial changes related variable seismic sources. In this study, we apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering to cross-correlation functions computed using seismic networks at two volcanoes. This allows us to form groups of data that share similar characteristics and also, unlike common similarity measures, does not require a defined reference period. At Piton de la Fournaise (La Réunion island), we resolve distinct clusters that relate both to changes in the seismic source (volcanic tremor onset) and changes in the medium following volcanic eruptions. At Mt Ruapehu (New Zealand), we observe a consistency to cross-correlation functions computed in the frequency band of volcanic tremor, suggesting tremor could be useful as a repeatable seismic source. Our results demonstrate the potential of hierarchical clustering as a similarity measure for cross-correlation functions, suggesting it could be a useful step towards recognizing structure in seismic interferometry data sets. This can benefit both decisions in processing and interpretations of observed subsurface changes.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076383","Statistical methods;Computational seismology;Seismic interferometry;Seismic noise;Volcano seismology","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The tube waves, which have linear moveouts with velocities of 1.29 and 1.41 km s−1 at plastic and steel casings, respectively, are generated by double scattering on the shallow side of the wells. We characterize wavefields to confirm that these late coda waves are tube waves that are excited at the source well, propagate upward, then travel to a receiver well as a body wave, and finally propagate downward along the receiver well. Even though these tube waves result from second-order scattering, they have large amplitudes because of the relatively short distance between source and receiver wells. Because these waves propagate along both wells many times, we can extract detailed information of wave propagation by averaging them to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We first use the tube waves to relocate sources and receivers between multiple monitoring surveys, demonstrating our ability to correct the severe noise caused by location errors that frequently degrades the repeatability of time-lapse surveys. Then, we apply an inversion based on the physics of tube waves to estimate the location and strength of the scatterers and find that they are predominantly located in the shallow segment of the wells, above the sources, and infer that they are related to local fractures and/or wellbore conditions because their locations do not correspond to the well geometry. Lastly, we use the tube waves to accurately estimate subsurface velocities along the wells. The estimation is stable and robust, and the velocities follow the general trend of subsurface structure seen in the well log data. Due to the receiver spacing, tube-wave analysis cannot resolve a thin, high-velocity layer at the CO2 reservoir. By combining tube waves observed during different stages of the monitoring survey, we can estimate the time-lapse changes of the subsurface velocities.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggac471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076385","Time-series analysis;Guided waves;Wave propagation;Wave scattering and diffraction","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We demonstrate that the energetics of the observed star formation rate is sufficient to tear apart the dusty veil on time-scales of 20–25 Myr. This can explain the apparent lack of evolution of ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies between z ≥ 10 and z ∼ 7, by compensating for the lower galaxy masses at higher redshift by the absence of dust.

We present a multifrequency spectral and temporal study of high redshift blazar PKS 0537−286 by analysing data from Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR Swift XRT, and UVOT. Although the time averaged γ-ray spectrum of the source is relatively soft (indicating the high-energy emission peak is below the GeV range), several prominent flares were observed when the spectrum hardened and the luminosity increased above 1049 erg s−1. The X-ray emission of the source varies in different observations and is characterized by a hard spectrum ≤1.38 with a luminosity of >1047 erg s−1. The broad-band spectral energy distribution in the quiescent and flaring periods was modelled within a one-zone leptonic scenario assuming different locations of the emission region and considering both internal (synchrotron radiation) and external (from the disc, broad-line region, and dusty torus) photon fields for the inverse Compton scattering. The modelling shows that the most optimistic scenario, from the energy requirement point of view, is when the jet energy dissipation occurs within the broad-line region. The comparison of the model parameters obtained for the quiescent and flaring periods suggests that the flaring activities are most likely caused by the hardening of the emitting electron spectral index and shifting of the cut-off energy to higher values.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076317","galaxies: active;galaxies: jets;quasars: individual: PKS 0537-286;gamma-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Doing so has led to the discovery of Mbh–M*,sph and Mbh–M*,gal relations for dusty S0 galaxies – built by major wet mergers and comprising half the S0 sample – offset from the distribution of dust-poor S0 galaxies. The situation is reminiscent of how major dry mergers of massive S0 galaxies have created an offset population of ellicular and elliptical galaxies. For a given Mbh, the dust-rich S0 galaxies have 3–4 times higher M*,sph than the dust-poor S0 galaxies, and the steep distributions of both populations in the Mbh–M*,sph diagram bracket the $M_{\rm bh} \propto M_{\rm *,sph}^{2.27+/-0.48}$ relation defined by the spiral galaxies, themselves renovated through minor mergers. The new relations offer refined means to estimate Mbh in other galaxies and should aid with: (i) constructing (galaxy morphology)-dependent black hole mass functions; (ii) estimating the masses of black holes associated with tidal disruption events; (iii) better quantifying evolution in the scaling relations via improved comparisons with high-z data by alleviating the pickle of apples versus oranges; (iv) mergers and long-wavelength gravitational wave science; (v) simulations of galaxy/black hole coevolution and semi-analytic works involving galaxy speciation; plus (vi) facilitating improved extrapolations into the intermediate-mass black hole landscape.

Here, we explore how the interplay between halo formation time-scales, star formation efficiency, and dust attenuation affects the properties and number densities of galaxies observed in the early Universe. To guide intuition, we calculate the theoretical upper limit on the UV luminosity function (LF), assuming star formation is 100 per cent efficient and all gas in haloes is converted into stars, and that galaxies are at the peak age for UV emission (∼10 Myr). This upper limit is ∼4 orders of magnitude greater than current observations, implying no formal tension with star formation in Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. In a more realistic model, we use the distribution of halo formation time-scales derived from extended Press–Schechter theory as a proxy for star formation rate (SFR). We predict that the galaxies observed so far at z ≳ 10 are dominated by those with the fastest formation time-scales, and thus most extreme SFRs and young ages. These galaxies can be upscattered by ∼1.5 mag compared to the median UV magnitude versus halo mass relation. This likely introduces a selection effect at high redshift whereby only the youngest (≲10 Myr), most highly star-forming galaxies (specific SFR$\gtrsim 30\, \mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$) have been detected so far. Furthermore, our modelling suggests that redshift evolution at the bright end of the UV LF is substantially affected by the build-up of dust attenuation. We predict that deeper JWST observations (reaching m ∼ 30) will reveal more typical galaxies with relatively older ages (∼100 Myr) and less extreme specific SFRs ($\sim 10\, \mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$ for a MUV ∼ −20 galaxy at z ∼ 10).","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076287","galaxies: evolution;cosmology: theory;galaxies: high-redshift;dark ages;reionization;first stars","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Specifically, this problem results from ignoring a variety of galaxy formation effects, including assembly bias, segregation of satellite galaxies relative to dark matter, and baryonic effects on the matter distribution. All these effects contribute towards overestimating gravitational lensing, and when combined, explain the amplitude and scale dependence of the lensing is low problem. We conclude that simplistic galaxy–halo connection models are inadequate to interpret clustering and lensing simultaneously, and that it is crucial to employ more sophisticated models for the upcoming generation of large-scale surveys.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076291","gravitational lensing: weak;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: statistics;large-scale structure of Universe;cosmology: observations;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

If life can strongly influence its global environment, then we would expect the boundaries of the habitable zone to be influenced by the presence of life. Here, using a simple abstract model of ‘tangled-ecology’ where life can influence a global parameter, labelled as temperature, we investigate the boundaries of the habitable zone of our model system. As with other models of life-climate interactions, the species act to regulate the temperature. However, the system can also experience ‘punctuations’, where the system's state jumps between different equilibria. Despite this, an ensemble of systems still tends to sustain or even improve conditions for life on average, a feature we call Entropic Gaia. The mechanism behind this is sequential selection with memory which is discussed in detail. With this modelling framework we investigate questions about how Gaia can affect and ultimately extend the habitable zone to what we call the Gaian habitable zone. This generates concrete predictions for the size of the habitable zone around stars, suggests directions for future work on the simulation of exoplanets and provides insight into the Gaian bottleneck hypothesis and the habitability/inhabitance paradox.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076325","astrobiology;software: simulations","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

They are dominated by by uniformly old stellar populations, have low star formation rates, early type morphologies, and little cold gas. Despite having old stellar populations and little in situ star formation, studies have shown that they have grown their stellar mass since z = 1, implying that they grow predominantly via the accretion of satellites. Tests of this picture have been limited because of the lack of deep imaging data sets that both covers a large enough area of the sky to contain substantial numbers of LRGs and that also is deep enough to detect faint satellites. We use the 25 deg2 Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to characterize the satellite galaxy population of LRGs out to z = 0.65. The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys are comprised of grz imaging to 2–2.5 mag deeper than SDSS and with better image quality. We use a new statistical background technique to identify excess populations of putative satellite galaxies around 1823 LRGs at 0.2 < z < 0.65. In three redshift and luminosity bins we measure the numbers of satellite galaxies and their r−z colour distribution down to rest-frame g-band luminosity limits at least 3.6 times fainter than L*. In addition, we develop a forward modeling technique and apply it to constrain the mean number of satellites in each of our redshift and luminosity bins. Finally, we use these estimates to determine the amount of stellar mass growth in LRGs down to the local Universe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076289","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular;cD;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: general","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Yet the restoration of the Alfven wave fluctuations from a given magnetic field, aka the local Alfven wave problem, is never properly addressed in literature albeit its importance. Previous works model the Alfven wave fluctuation as the perturbation along a straight-line, constant magnetic field. However, Lazarian & Pogosyan (2012) suggested that the decomposition of Alfven wave along a straight line, aka. the global frame decomposition, has a factor of discrepancy to the true local Alfven wave fluctuation. Here, we provide a geometric interpretation on how the local Alfven wave is related to the global frame through the use of vector frame formulation. We prove both analytically and numerically that the local frame Alfven wave is an orthogonal transformation of that of the global frame and related by the local Alfvenic Mach number. In other words, when we observe Alfven wave in the global frame of reference, some of the Alfven wave will be mistaken as compressible waves. The importance of frame choices has a far-reaching impact to the analytical studies of MHD turbulence. Combining the frame formalism and the new techniques we can have accurate measurement to some of the fundamental turbulence properties like the inclination angle of mean magnetic field relative to the line of sight.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076293","turbulence;ISM: magnetic fields;ISM: structure;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is expected to be prominent on the LISA sky due to its proximity and its large population of double white dwarfs (DWD). Here, we present the first dedicated study of the LMC with gravitational wave sources. We assemble three LMC models based on: (1) the density distribution and star formation history from optical wavelength observations, (2) a detailed hydrodynamic simulation, and (3) combining the two. Our models yield a hundred to several hundred detectable DWDs: indeed, the LMC will be a resolved galaxy in the LISA sky. Importantly, amongst these we forecast a few tens to a hundred double degenerate supernovae type Ia progenitors, a class of binaries which have never been unambiguously observed. The range in the number of detections is primarily due to differences in the LMC total stellar mass and recent star formation in our models. Our results suggest that the total number, periods, and chirp masses of LISA sources may provide independent constraints on both LMC stellar mass and recent star formation by comparing LISA observations with the models, although such constraints will be highly model-dependent. Our publicly available model populations may be used in future studies of the LMC, including its structure and contribution to LISA confusion noise.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076327","gravitational waves;binaries (including multiple): close;white dwarfs;Magellanic Clouds;galaxies: stellar content","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This relatively constant CN/HCN line ratio is rather unexpected, as models of photon dominated regions have suggested that HCN emission traces shielded regions with high column densities while CN should trace dense gas exposed to high ultraviolet radiation fields. We find that the CN/HCN line ratio shows no significant correlation with molecular gas surface density but shows a mild trend (increase of ∼1.3 per dex) with both star formation rate surface density and star formation efficiency (the inverse of the molecular gas depletion time). Some starburst and active galactic nuclei show small enhancements in their CN/HCN ratio, while other nuclei show no significant difference from their surrounding discs.

The classifier uses the five features: Gaia G-band variability, WISE mid-infrared excess, UKIDSS and 2MASS near-infrared excess, IGAPS Hα excess, and overluminosity with respect to the main sequence. A list of candidate Class II YSOs is obtained by choosing a posterior threshold appropriate to the task at hand, balancing the competing demands of completeness and purity. At a threshold posterior greater than 0.5, our classifier identifies 6504 candidate Class II YSOs. At this threshold, we find a false positive rate around 0.02 per cent and a true positive rate of approximately 87 per cent for identifying Class II YSOs. The ROC curve rises rapidly to almost one with an area under the curve around 0.998 or better, indicating the classifier is efficient at identifying candidate Class II YSOs. Our map of these candidates shows what are potentially three previously undiscovered clusters or associations. When comparing our results to published catalogues from other young star classifiers, we find between one quarter and three quarters of high probability candidates are unique to each classifier, telling us no single classifier is finding all young stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076295","methods: statistical;catalogues;stars: formation;stars: pre-main-sequence;stars: variables: T Tauri;Herbig Ae/Be","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The majority of stars (82.8 per cent) contain additional frequencies beyond the main pulsation. In addition to the frequencies previously explained by the ℓ = 8 and 9 non-radial modes, we have identified a group of stars where the additional frequencies may belong to the ℓ = 10 non-radial modes. We found that stars with no additional frequencies are more common among stars with shorter periods, while stars with longer periods almost always show additional frequencies. The incidence rate and this period distribution both agree well with the predictions of recent theoretical models. The amplitude and phase of additional frequencies are varying in time. The frequencies of different non-radial modes appearing in a given star seem to vary on different time-scales. We have determined a 10.4 per cent incidence rate for the Blazhko effect. For several stars we have detected continuous annual-scale phase change without significant amplitude variation. This type of variation offers a plausible explanation for the ‘phase jump’ phenomenon reported in many RRc stars. The main pulsation frequency could show quasi-periodic phase and amplitude fluctuations. This fluctuation is clearly related to additional frequencies present in the star: stars with two non-radial modes show the strongest fluctuations, while stars with no such modes show no fluctuations at all. The summation of the phase fluctuation over time may explain the O−C variations that have long been known for many non-Blazhko RRc stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076329","asteroseismology;methods: data analysis;space vehicles;techniques: photometric;stars: oscillations;stars: variables: RR Lyrae","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We derive analytical expressions for the anisotropic collision frequencies using the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation. The average parallel, perpendicular, and Hall electrical conductivities are computed in the high-temperature regime above crustal melting, considering incoherent elastic electron-pasta scattering and randomly oriented pasta structures. Numerical values are obtained at different densities and temperatures by using the Indiana University–Florida State University (IUFSU) parametrization of the non-linear Walecka model to determine the crustal structure. We find that the anisotropy of the collision frequencies grows with the length of the pasta structures and, independently of the magnetic field, the presence of rod and slab phases decreases the conductivity by more than one order of magnitude. Our numerical results indicate that, even if the pasta structures might survive above the crustal melting point, no strong anisotropies are to be expected in the conduction properties in this temperature regime, even in the presence of a very high magnetic field.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076333","conduction;dense matter;stars: neutron","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We present a novel approach towards solving radiative transfer of diffuse sources via backwards ray tracing. Here, we focus on the radiative transfer of infrared radiation and the radiation pressure on dust. The new module, TREERAY/RADPRESSURE, is an extension to the novel radiative transfer method TREERAY implemented in the grid-based Magneto-Hydrodynamics code FLASH. In TREERAY/RADPRESSURE, every cell and every star particle is a source of infrared radiation. We also describe how gas, dust, and radiation are coupled via a chemical network. This allows us to compute the local dust temperature in thermal equilibrium, leading to a significantly improvement over the classical grey approximation. In several tests, we demonstrate that the scheme produces the correct radiative intensities as well as the correct momentum input by radiation pressure. Subsequently, we apply our new scheme to model massive star formation from a collapsing, turbulent core of 150 M⊙. We include the effects of both, ionizing and infrared radiation on the dynamics of the core. We find that the newborn massive star prevents fragmentation in its proximity due to radiative heating. Over time, dust and radiation temperature equalize, while the gas temperature can be either warmer due to shock heating or colder due to insufficient dust–gas coupling. Compared to gravity, the effects of radiation pressure are insignificant for the stellar mass on the simulated time-scale in this work.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076300","radiative transfer;stars: massive;(ISM:) dust;extinction;(ISM:) HII regions;radiative transfer","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The goal is to identify the best stars with which to test whether the fine-structure constant, α, varies with dark matter density in our Galaxy. Here, we use EPIC, our line-by-line differential technique, to measure the stellar parameters – effective temperature Teff, surface gravity log g, and metallicity [Fe/H] – from moderate-resolution (R ≲ 32 000) spectra of 877 solar twin and analogue candidates (547 at 1–$4\, {\rm kpc}$) observed with the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES) on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These are consistent with expectations for Teff and log g from photometry, and for [Fe/H] from the Besançon stellar population model. EPIC provides small enough uncertainties ($\sim 90\, {\rm K}$, $0.08\, {\rm dex}$, and $0.05\, {\rm dex}$, respectively), even at the low signal-to-noise ratios available (${\rm S/N}\gtrsim$ 25 per pixel), to identify 299 new solar analogues ($\ge 90~{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ confidence) and 20 solar twins (≥50 per cent confidence), 206 and 12 of which are at 1–$4\, {\rm kpc}$.

Such Constrained Interacting Dark Energy scenario – or CIDER – has been recently proposed in the literature and has the appealing feature of suppressing structure formation at late times, thereby possibly alleviating the persisting σ8 tension while leaving background observables unaffected. A crucial step to assess the viability of such scenarios is then represented by quantifying their impact on structure formation at non-linear scales, which is what we start investigating with the simulations discussed in the present work. We show that – for reasonable parameter choices – the reconstructed scalar potential is close to an exponential for most of the matter dominated epoch, and that the non-linear evolution of structures in these models imprints specific footprints on matter and halo statistics that may allow to break degeneracies with standard cosmological parameters.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076304","galaxies: formation;dark energy;dark matter;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A known remedy, driving CDM out of Galactic Centres, invokes interactions with baryons, through fluctuations in the gravitational potential arising from feedback or orbiting clumps of gas or stars. Here, we interpret core formation in a hydrodynamic simulation in terms of a theoretical formulation, which may be considered a generalization of Chandrasekhar's theory of two body relaxation to the case when the density fluctuations do not arise from white noise; it presents a simple characterization of the effects of complex hydrodynamics and ‘subgrid physics’. The power spectrum of gaseous fluctuations is found to follow a power law over a range of scales, appropriate for a fully turbulent compressible medium. The potential fluctuations leading to core formation are nearly normally distributed, which allows for the energy transfer leading to core formation to be described as a standard diffusion process, initially increasing the velocity dispersion of test particles as in Chandrasekhar's theory. We calculate the energy transfer from the fluctuating gas to the halo and find it consistent with theoretical expectations. We also examine how the initial kinetic energy input to halo particles is redistributed to form a core. The temporal mass decrease inside the forming core may be fit by an exponential form; a simple prescription based on our model associates the characteristic time-scale with an energy relaxation time. We compare the resulting theoretical density distribution with that in the simulation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076339","dark matter;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: evolution","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In kinematics, we observe ridges/clumps of ‘kinematic groups’, like studies of more massive main-sequence stars. Here, we note clear differences in both metallicity and vertical velocity as compared with the surrounding regions in velocity space and hypothesize this is due to differences in mean age. To test this, we develop a method to estimate the age distribution of subpopulations of stars. In this method, we use GALAH data to define probability distributions of W versus [M/H] in age bins of 2 Gyr and determine optimal age distributions as the best-fitting weighted sum of these distributions. This process is then validated using the GALAH subset. We estimate the probable age distribution for regions in the kinematic plane, where we find significant substructure that is correlated with the kinematic groups. Most notably, we find an age gradient across the Hercules streams that is correlated with birth radius. Finally, we examine the bending and breathing modes as a function of age. From this, we observe potential hints of an increase in the bending amplitude with age, which will require further analysis in order to confirm it. This is one of the first studies to examine these chemodynamics in the SN using primarily low-mass stars and we hope these findings can better constrain dynamical models of the Milky Way due to the increase in resolution the sample size provides.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076306","Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics;(Galaxy:) solar neighbourhood;stars: abundance","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, radio-frequency interference (RFI) from human activities affects sensitive radio telescopes, and significantly affects the quality of observation. Thus, RFI detection and mitigation for the observations is necessary to obtain high quality science-ready data. The flagging of RFI is particularly challenging for the solar and space weather observations at low frequency, because the solar radio bursts can be brighter than the RFI, and may show similar temporal behaviour. In this work, we investigate RFI flagging methods for solar and space weather observations, including a strategy for AOLAGGER, and a novel method that makes use of a morphology convolution. These algorithms can effectively flag RFI while preserving solar radio bursts.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076310","methods: data analysis;Sun: radio radiation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In a series of recent papers, we developed optimal analysis procedures that expose and eliminate the subjectivity and bias in previous quasar absorption system measurements. In this paper, we analyse the ESPRESSO spectrum of the absorption system at zabs = 1.15 towards the quasar HE 0515-4414. Our goal here is not to provide a new unbiased measurement of Δα/α in this system (that will be done separately). Rather, it is to carefully examine the impact of blinding procedures applied in many previous measurements of the fine structure constant in quasar absorption systems. To do this, we emulate previous procedures, using supercomputer Monte Carlo AI calculations to generate a large number of independently constructed models of the absorption complex. Each model is obtained using AI-VPFIT, with Δα/α fixed until a ‘final’ model for the absorption system is obtained, at which point Δα/α is then released as a free parameter for one final optimization. The results show that the value of Δα/α obtained in this way is systematically biased towards the initially fixed value i.e. this process produces measurements that are unrelated to the true value of Δα/α. The implication is straightforward: to avoid bias, all future measurements must include Δα/α as a free parameter from the beginning of the modelling process.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076345","cosmological parameters;methods: data analysis;numerical;statistical;techniques: spectroscopic;quasars: absorption lines","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The outskirts are more strongly correlated with the halo than the core, which supports that the BCG+ICL system follows a two-phase growth, where recent growth (z < 2) occurs beyond the BCG's core. Additionally, we compare our observed SMHM relation results to the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and find moderate qualitative agreement in the amount of diffuse light. However, the SMHM relation's slope is steeper in TNG300-1 and the intrinsic scatter is lower, likely from the absence of projection effects in TNG300-1. Additionally, we find that the ICL exhibits a colour gradient such that the outskirts are bluer than the core. Moreover, for the lower halo mass clusters (log10(M200m,SZ/M⊙) < 14.59), we detect a modest change in the colour gradient's slope with lookback time, which combined with the absence of stellar mass growth may suggest that lower mass clusters have been involved in growth via tidal stripping more recently than their higher mass counterparts.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076308","galaxies: clusters: general;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular;cD;galaxies: evolution","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This oscillatory instability offers a plausible explanation for the periodic radial density variations seen at several locations of Saturn's B and inner-A ring. So far, the theoretical understanding of overstable ring systems relies mainly on analytical results based on approximate treatments of ring self-gravity which omit the emergence of self-gravity wakes (small-scale gravitational instabilities). Therefore, the interplay between the two mechanisms, self-gravity and overstability, is still not well understood. Here, we address numerically the factors that determine the onset of overstability in self-gravitating rings. We confirm that weak self-gravity promotes overstability whereas strong self-gravity, with prominent wake structure, weakens the overstable pattern. This strong gravity regime corresponds to optical depths beyond a threshold value. In systems where overstable oscillations and wakes co-exist, we detect a strong anticorrelation between the strength of wakes and overstable oscillations. It is this interaction that eventually leads to the suppression of overstability, with strong transient wake structure preventing the phase synchronization between density and velocity oscillations required to maintain a coherent overstable pattern. Finally, we derive a composite criterion for the onset of overstability valid even in the regime of strong gravity wakes, framed in terms of collective properties of the system: the central-plane filling factor and the ratio of gravitational and collisional viscosities. In the limit where gravity wakes are omitted, our new criterion agrees with that found by the kinetic theory analysis of linear stability.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076312","methods: numerical;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability;planets and satellites: rings","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We study different properties of the pulsar using data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations. The unstable burning of accreted material on the surface of neutron stars induces thermonuclear (Type-I) bursts. Several such thermonuclear bursts have been detected by MAXI J1816−195 during its outburst. We investigate the evolution of the burst profiles with flux and energy using NuSTAR and NICER observations. During the NuSTAR observation, a total of four bursts were detected from the source. The duration of each burst is around ∼30 s and the ratio of peak to persistent count rate is ∼26 as seen from the NuSTAR data. The burst profiles are modelled using a sharp linear rise and exponential decay function to determine the burst timing parameters. The burst profiles show a relatively long tail at lower energies. The broad-band time-resolved spectra during the burst periods are successfully modelled with a combination of an absorbed blackbody along with a non-thermal component to account for the persistent emission. From our modelling results, we are able to estimate the maximum apparent emitting area of the blackbody of the neutron star to be ∼12.5 km during the peak of the outburst and the maximum distance to the object to be 8.7 kpc. Our findings for the mass accretion rate and the α factor indicate the stable burning of hydrogen via a hot CNO cycle during the bursts.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076347","accretion;accretion discs;stars: neutron;X-rays: binaries;X-rays: bursts;X-rays: individual: MAXI J1816−195","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is thus important to investigate how a crystalline core may affect the properties and dynamics of white dwarfs. In this paper, we first study the dependence of the frequencies of the fundamental (f), interfacial (i), and shear (s) oscillation modes on the size of the crystalline core. We find that the frequencies of the i and s modes depend sensitively on the size of the core, while the frequency of the f mode is affected only slightly by at most a few percent for our chosen white dwarf models. We next consider the tidal deformability of crystallized white dwarfs and find that the effect of crystallization becomes significant only when the radius of the core is larger than about 70  per cent of the stellar radius. The tidal deformability can change by a few to about 10 per cent when a white dwarf becomes fully crystallized. We also show that there exist approximate equation-of-state insensitive relations connecting the mass, moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and f-mode frequency for pure fluid white dwarfs. Depending on the stellar mass and composition, however, these relations can be affected by a few percent when the white dwarf is crystallized. These changes could leave an imprint on the gravitational waves emitted from the late inspiral or merger of white dwarf binaries, which may be detectable by future space-borne gravitational wave detectors.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076351","gravitational waves;stars: oscillations;white dwarfs","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Some of the X-rays from the central corona irradiating the disc are absorbed, increasing the local disc temperature. This gives an additional reprocessed contribution to the spectral energy distribution (SED) which is lagged and smeared relative to the driving X-ray light curve. We directly calculate this reverberation from the accretion disc, creating fully time-dependent SEDs for a given X-ray light curve. We apply this to recent intensive monitoring data on Fairall 9, and find that it is not possible to produce the observed ultraviolet (UV) variability by X-ray reprocessing of the observed light curve from the disc. Instead, we find that the majority of the variability must be intrinsic to the UV emission process, adding to evidence from changing-look AGN that this region has a structure which is quite unlike a Shakura–Sunyaev disc. We filter out this long time-scale variability and find that reprocessing alone is still insufficient to explain even the fast variability in our assumed geometry of a central source illuminating a flat disc. The amplitude of reprocessing can be increased by any vertical structure such as the broad-line region and/or an inner disc wind, giving a better match. Fundamentally though the model is missing the major contributor to the variability, intrinsic to the UV/EUV emission rather than arising from reprocessing.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076314","accretion;accretion discs;black hole physics;galaxies: active;galaxies: individual: Fairall 9","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here we introduce the Physics-Informed neural Network for reIONization (PINION), which can accurately and swiftly predict the complete 4D hydrogen fraction evolution from the smoothed gas and mass density fields from pre-computed N-body simulation. We trained PINION on the C2-Ray simulation outputs and a physics constraint on the reionization chemistry equation is enforced. With only five redshift snapshots, PINION can accurately predict the entire reionization history between z = 6 and 12. We evaluate the accuracy of our predictions by analyzing the dimensionless power spectra and morphology statistics estimations against C2-Ray results. We show that while the network's predictions are in very good agreement with simulation to redshift z > 7, the network's accuracy suffers for z < 7. We motivate how PINION performance could be improved using additional inputs and potentially generalized to large-scale simulations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076349","radiative transfer;software: simulations;cosmology: dark ages;reionization;first stars","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using the genetic modification approach, we create five cosmological histories for a Milky-Way-mass dark matter halo ($M_{200}\approx 10^{12} \, \mbox{M}_\mathrm{\odot }$), incrementally increasing the stellar mass ratio of a z ≈ 2 merger from 1:25 to 1:2, while fixing the galaxy's final dynamical, stellar mass, and large-scale environment. We find markedly different morphologies at z = 0 following this change in early history, with a growing merger resulting in increasingly compact and bulge-dominated galaxies. Despite this structural diversity, all galaxies show a radially biased population of inner halo stars like the Milky-Way's GSE which, surprisingly, has a similar magnitude, age, $\rm [Fe/H]$, and $\rm [\alpha /Fe]$ distribution whether the z ≈ 2 merger is more minor or major. This arises because a smaller ex-situ population at z ≈ 2 is compensated by a larger population formed in an earlier merger-driven starburst whose contribution to the GES can grow dynamically over time, and with both populations strongly overlapping in the $\rm [Fe/H]-\rm [\alpha /Fe]$ plane. Our study demonstrates that multiple high-redshift histories can lead to similar z = 0 chemodynamical features in the halo, highlighting the need for additional constraints to distinguish them, and the importance of considering the full spectrum of progenitors when interpreting z = 0 data to reconstruct our Galaxy's past.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076316","methods: numerical;Galaxy: formation;Galaxy: halo;galaxies: formation;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this work, we investigated the kinematics of five highly resolved galaxies at z ∼ 4.5 observed with ALMA in the [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission line. The sample is diverse: AzTEC1 (starburst galaxy), BRI1335-0417 (starburst and quasar host galaxy), J081740 (normal star-forming galaxy), and SGP38326 (two starburst galaxies in a group). The five galaxies show velocity gradients, but four were found to be rotating discs, while the remaining, AzTEC1, is likely a merger. We studied the gas kinematics of the discs using 3DBAROLO and found that they rotate with maximum rotation velocities between 198 and 562 km s−1, while the gas velocity dispersions, averaged across the discs, are between 49 and 75 km s−1. The rotation curves are generally flat and the galaxies have ratios of ordered-to-random motion (V/σ) between 2.7 and 9.8. We present CANNUBI, an algorithm for fitting the disc geometry of rotating discs in 3D emission-line observations prior to modelling the kinematics, with which we find indications that these discs may have thicknesses of the order of 1 kpc.

Large absorber samples are required to robustly measure typical absorber properties and to refine models of the synthesis, transport, and ionization of metals in the early Universe. The Ultimate XSHOOTER legacy survey of quasars at z ∼ 5.8–6.6 (XQR-30) has obtained high signal-to-noise spectra of 30 luminous quasars, nearly quadrupling the existing sample of 12 high quality z ∼ 6 quasar spectra. We use this unprecedented sample to construct a catalogue of 778 systems showing absorption in one or more of Mg II (360 systems), Fe II (184), C II (46), C IV (479), Si IV (127), and N V (13) which span 2 ≲ z ≲ 6.5. This catalogue significantly expands on existing samples of z ≳ 5 absorbers, especially for C IV and Si IV which are important probes of the ionizing photon background at high redshift. The sample is 50 per cent (90 per cent) complete for rest-frame equivalent widths W ≳ 0.03 Å (0.09 Å). We publicly release the absorber catalogue along with completeness statistics and a PYTHON script to compute the absorption search path for different ions and redshift ranges. This data set is a key legacy resource for studies of enriched gas from the era of galaxy assembly to cosmic noon, and paves the way for even higher redshift studies with JWST and 30 m-class telescopes.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stac3662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076286","intergalactic medium;quasars: absorption lines;early Universe","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our explanation of these evolutionary phenomena has occasionally been dismissed with just a few words in refereed or non-refereed publications. In a recent case, the fact that over the years I have not replied to these criticisms was interpreted as evidence that they were well founded.

The average rotation rate (i.e. from 2011 to 2021) of the equatorial region of EUV corona is found to be higher than that of the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona. Furthermore, the average rotational gradient (as a function of latitude) of the EUV corona is lower than that of the photosphere and transition region. Interestingly, we found a significant correlation of the hemispheric rotational asymmetry with the solar activity indicator (SSNs) and EUV emission.

We present the radio-EBL at 150 MHz, 325 MHz, 610 MHz, 1.4 GHz, 3 GHz, 5 GHz, and 8.4 GHz. In all cases the contribution to the radio-EBL, per decade of flux, exhibits a two-humped distribution well matched to the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and star-forming galaxy (SFG) populations, and with each population contributing roughly equal energy. Only at 3 GHz are the source count contributions to the EBL fully convergent, and hence we report empirical lower limits to the radio-EBL in the remaining bands. Adopting predictions from the SHARK semi-analytic model for the form of the SFG population, we can fit the fainter source counts providing measurements of the total contribution to the radio-EBL for the SFG and the AGN populations separately. This constitutes an empirically constrained model-dependent measurement for the SFG contribution, but a fully empirical measurement of the AGN contribution. Using the PROSPECT spectral energy distribution code we can model the ultraviolet-optical-infrared-mm-radio SFG EBL at all frequencies from the cosmic star-formation history and the adoption of a Chabrier initial mass function. However, significant discrepancy remains (5 ×) between our source-count estimates of the radio-EBL and the direct measurements reported from the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission-2 (ARCADE-2) experiment. We can rule out a significant missing discrete source radio population and suggest that the cause of the high ARCADE-2 radio-EBL values may need to be sought either in the foreground subtraction or as a yet unknown diffuse component in the radio sky.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076288","surveys;catalogues;galaxies: active;cosmology: cosmic background radiation;cosmological parameters;radio continuum: galaxies","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here, we are interested in how the presence of dark matter affects the properties of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from a thin accretion disc. For this purpose, we use the Novikov–Thorne model and obtain the electromagnetic spectrum of an accretion disc around a rotating black hole in perfect fluid dark matter and compare with the general relativistic case. The results indicate that for small values of dark matter parameter we considered here, the size of the innermost stable circular orbits would decrease and thus the electromagnetic spectrum of the accretion disc increases. Therefore, discs in the presence of perfect fluid dark matter are hotter and more luminous than in general relativity. Finally, we construct thin accretion disc images around these black holes using the numerical ray-tracing technique. We show that the inclination angle has a remarkable effect on the images, whereas the effect of dark matter parameter is small.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076330","accretion;accretion discs;black hole physics;dark matter","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Previous studies suggest that the C IV cosmic mass density ($\Omega _{\rm C \, \small {IV}}$) decreases slowly over 1.5 $\lesssim \, z\lesssim$ 5 before declining rapidly at z ≳ 5, but the cause of this downturn is poorly understood. We characterize the $\Omega _{\rm C \, \small {IV}}$ evolution over 4.3 ≲ z ≲ 6.3 using 260 absorbers found in 42 XSHOOTER spectra of z ∼ 6 quasars, of which 30 come from the ESO Large Program XQR-30. The large sample enables us to robustly constrain the rate and timing of the downturn. We find that $\Omega _{\rm C \, \small {IV}}$ decreases by a factor of 4.8 ± 2.0 over the ∼300 Myr interval between z ∼ 4.7 and ∼5.8. The slope of the column density (log N) distribution function does not change, suggesting that C IV absorption is suppressed approximately uniformly across 13.2 ≤ log N/cm−2 < 15.0. Assuming that the carbon content of galaxy haloes evolves as the integral of the cosmic star formation rate density (with some delay due to stellar lifetimes and outflow travel times), we show that chemical evolution alone could plausibly explain the fast decline in $\Omega _{\rm C \, \small {IV}}$ over 4.3 ≲ z ≲ 6.3. However, the C IV/C II ratio decreases at the highest redshifts, so the accelerated decline in $\Omega _{\rm C \, \small {IV}}$ at z ≳ 5 may be more naturally explained by rapid changes in the gas ionization state driven by evolution of the UV background towards the end of hydrogen reionization.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076294","intergalactic medium;quasars: absorption lines;early Universe","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Based on this deep observation, no new extra gas was found around DDO 167 and it was hardly resolved by FAST. On the other hand, on the north side of DDO 168 we discovered an extended plume of H I gas which has never been detected before. The plume has a ring-like structure with a radius of about 5.0 kpc and its gas mass is estimated to be 5.2 × 107 M⊙. The expanding velocity of the plume is about 30 km s−1, corresponding to a dynamical age of about 200 Myr. The position–velocity (PV) diagrams cut through the two galaxies show a short and pronounced ‘spur’ pointing to DDO 167 from DDO 168, indicating a tidal interaction between the two galaxies. We also found an H I knot in the plume. The gas mass of the knot is about 9.5 × 106 M⊙. This value is much higher than its virial mass, indicating the knot is gravitationally unstable and star formation will take place there in the future. Our study suggests that the ring-like structure of the plume might be caused by the passage of DDO 167 through the outer disc of DDO 168 about 200 Myr ago.

Observations show that in a small fraction of TDEs, a short-lived, synchrotron emitting jet is produced. We observed the newly discovered TDE AT2022cmc with a slew of radio facilities over the first 100 d after its discovery. The light curve from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array radio interferometer shows day-time-scale variability which we attribute to a high brightness temperature emitting region as opposed to scintillation. We measure a brightness temperature of 2 × 1015 K, which is unphysical for synchrotron radiation. We suggest that the measured high brightness temperature is a result of relativistic beaming caused by a jet being launched at velocities close to the speed of light along our line of sight. We infer from day-time-scale variability that the jet associated with AT2022cmc has a relativistic Doppler factor of at least 16, which corresponds to a bulk Lorentz factor of at least 8, if we are observing the jet directly on axis. Such an inference is the first conclusive evidence that the radio emission observed from some TDEs is from relativistic jets because it does not rely on an outflow model. We also compare the first 100 d of radio evolution of AT2022cmc with that of the previous bright relativistic TDE,Swift J1644, and find a remarkable similarity in their evolution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076296","radio continuum: transients;transients: tidal disruption events","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Since carbon monoxide (CO) is the second most abundant molecule in the Universe except for molecular hydrogen H2, it is suitable as a tracer for LIM surveys. However, just like other LIM surveys, CO intensity mapping also suffers strong foreground contamination that needs to be eliminated for extracting valuable astrophysical and cosmological information. In this work, we take 12CO($\it J$ = 1-0) emission line as an example to investigate whether deep learning method can effectively recover the signal by removing the foregrounds. The CO(1-0) intensity maps are generated by N-body simulations considering CO luminosity and halo mass relation, and we discuss two cases with median and low CO signals by comparing different relations. We add foregrounds generated from real observations, including thermal dust, spinning dust, free–free, synchrotron emission, and cosmic microwave background anisotropy. The beam with sidelobe effect is also considered. Our deep learning model is built upon ResUNet, which combines image generation algorithm UNet with the state-of-the-art architecture of deep learning, ResNet. The principal component analysis (PCA) method is employed to preprocess data before feeding it to the ResUNet. We find that, in the case of low instrumental noise, our UNet can efficiently reconstruct the CO signal map with correct line power spectrum by removing the foregrounds and recovering PCA signal loss and beam effects. Our method also can be applied to other intensity mappings like neutral hydrogen 21-cm surveys.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076334","methods: data analysis;diffuse radiation;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, confronting those predictions with observations is complicated by the fact that simulated clusters are not representative of observed samples where detailed mass profile constraints are possible. In this work, we calculate the symmetry-peakiness-alignment (SPA) morphology metrics for maps of X-ray emissivity from THE THREE HUNDRED project hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters at four redshifts, and thereby select a sample of morphologically relaxed, simulated clusters, using observational criteria. These clusters have on average earlier formation times than the full sample, confirming that they are both morphologically and dynamically more relaxed than typical. We constrain the concentration–mass–redshift relation of both the relaxed and complete sample of simulated clusters, assuming power-law dependences on mass (κm) and 1 + z (κζ), finding κm = −0.12 ± 0.07 and κζ = −0.27 ± 0.19 for the relaxed subsample. From an equivalently selected sample of massive, relaxed clusters observed with Chandra, we find κm = −0.12 ± 0.08 and κζ = −0.48 ± 0.19, in good agreement with the simulation predictions. The simulated and observed samples also agree well on the average concentration at a pivot mass and redshift providing further validation of the ΛCDM paradigm in the properties of the largest gravitationally collapsed structures observed.

Cosmic X-ray background (XRB) models require a large fraction of obscured AGNs to reproduce the observed XRB peak, motivating reliable SED analyses in objects where the AGNs may be ‘buried’ in the galaxy and in the mid-IR to far-IR SED. In this paper, we study a 24 $\mu$m-selected (S24 > 100 $\mu$Jy) sample of 95 galaxies with $0~{{\ \rm per\ cent}} \lt f_{\mathrm{ MIR},\mathrm{ AGN}} \lt 100~{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$, 0.4 < z < 2.7, and 1011L⊙ < LIR < 1013L⊙. We test the performance of AGN models ranging in torus optical depth via SED fitting, comparing results with Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy and X-ray observations. The best-fitting torus optical depth can shed light on whether these galaxies host a luminous obscured AGN population. We find that permitting a broader AGN SED parameter space results in improved fit quality with higher optical depths, higher FIR AGN contributions, and higher LBol, impacting the bright end of the LBol luminosity function. Our results suggest there may be a population of dust-obscured composites that are bolometrically significant but have their AGNs mostly hidden in the mid-IR SED. If so, literature applications of SED fitting that often simplify AGN models or omit optically thick tori may largely underestimate AGN contribution from composite sources, as these sources are both numerous and have solutions sensitive to the assumed range of AGN models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076342","galaxies: active;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: fundamental parameters;quasars: supermassive black holes;infrared: galaxies;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These measurements are currently in tension, with the number count dipole being 2–5 times larger than expected from CMB measurements. This discrepancy has been pointed out as a possible indication that the cosmological principle is not valid. In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting and estimating the cosmic dipole with gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers detected by the future next-generation detectors Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We model the expected signal and show that for binary black holes, the dipole amplitude in the number count of detections is independent of the characteristics of the population and provides a systematic-free tool to estimate the observer velocity. We introduce techniques to detect the cosmic dipole from number counting of GW detections and estimate its significance. We show that a GW dipole consistent with the amplitude of the dipole in radio galaxies would be detectable with >3σ significance with a few years of observation (106 GW detections) and estimated with a 16 per cent precision, while a GW dipole consistent with the CMB one would require at least 107 GW events for a confident detection. We also demonstrate that a total number Ntot of GW detections would be able to detect a dipole with amplitude $v_o/c \simeq 1/\sqrt{N_{\rm tot}}$.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076305","gravitational waves;galaxies: active;cosmology: cosmic background radiation","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Formation of such vortices requires a relatively sharp viscosity transition. Detailed modelling, however, indicates that viscosity transitions at the outer edge of the dead zone is relatively smooth. In this study, we present 2D global, non-isothermal, gas–dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the possibility of vortex excitation at smooth viscosity transitions. Our models are based on a recently postulated scenario, wherein the recombination of charged particles on the surface of dust grains results in reduced ionization fraction and, in turn, the turbulence due to magnetorotational instability. Thus, the α-parameter for the disc viscosity depends on the local dust-to-gas mass ratio. We found that the smooth viscosity transitions at the outer edge of the dead zone can become Rossby unstable and form vortices. A single large-scale vortex develops if the dust content of the disc is well coupled to the gas; however, multiple small-scale vortices ensue for the case of less coupled dust. As both type of vortices are trapped at the dead zone outer edge, they provide sufficient time for dust growth. The solid content collected by the vortices can exceed several hundred Earth masses, while the dust-to-gas density ratio within often exceeds unity. Thus, such vortices function as planetary nurseries within the disc, providing ideal sites for formation of planetesimals and eventually planetary systems.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076307","accretion;accretion discs;hydrodynamics;methods: numerical;protoplanetary discs","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Only MBHs overmassive relative to expected galaxy scaling relations, accreting at high Eddington rates, would be detectable. Their discovery would point to the presence of heavy MBH seeds, but care is needed to exclude the existence of lighter seeds as only overmassive MBHs are detectable in this type of galaxies. Conversely, if no overmassive MBHs are hosted in these galaxies, either there are no heavy seeds or they are rare. The most massive/highest redshift candidate galaxies can attain stellar masses in excess of $5\times 10^{10}\, {\rm M_\odot }$ by z ∼ 6 if they grow along the star formation rate–mass sequence, and can nurse an MBH growing from ${\sim}10^5 \, {\rm M_\odot }$ up to ${\gt}3\times 10^7\, {\rm M_\odot }$ by z ∼ 6, to become hosts of some z > 6 quasars.

In gaseous media, interactions between two initially unbound objects could result in gas-assisted binary formation, induced by a loss of kinetic energy to the ambient gas medium. Here, we derive analytically the criteria for gas-assisted binary capture through gas dynamical friction dissipation. We validate them with few-body simulations and explore this process in different gas-rich environments: gas-embedded star-forming regions (SFR), gas-enriched globular clusters, active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs, and protoplanetary discs. We find that gas-assisted binary capture is highly efficient in SFRs, potentially providing a main channel for the formation of binaries. It could also operate under certain conditions in gas-enriched globular clusters. Thin AGN discs could also provide a fertile ground for gas-assisted binary capture and in particular the formation of black hole/other compact object binaries, the production of gravitational-wave (GW) and other high-energy transients. Large-scale gaseous discs might be too thick to enable gas-assisted binary capture and previous estimates of the production of GW sources could be overestimated, and sensitive to specific conditions and the structure of the discs. In protoplanetary discs, while gas-assisted binary capture can produce binary Kuiper-belt objects, dynamical friction by small planetesimals is likely to be more efficient. Overall, we show that gas-assisted binary formation is robust and can contribute significantly to the binary formation rate in many environments. In fact, the gas-assisted binary capture rates are sufficiently high such that they will lead to multicaptures, and the formation of higher multiplicity systems.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076346","black hole physics;galaxies: active;galaxies: star formation;(Galaxy:) globular clusters: general;(stars:) binaries (including multiple): close","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These characteristics reflect the interaction of galaxies with the environment. However, it is not clear the degree of influence of the large-scale structure on the properties of void galaxies or if these are only influenced by the low local density around them typical of these regions. In this article, we identified cosmic voids in the SDSS-DR16 and studied the g–r colour, star formation rate, and concentration of galaxies. We identified galaxy groups to characterize the local environment and studied the properties of galaxies as a function of total and stellar masses, separately analysing those in voids and the general sample. Our results show that galaxies that inhabit haloes of a given mass (below ${\sim}10^{13.5}{\rm M}_{\odot }$), are bluer, have a higher star formation rate and are less concentrated when the host halo is inside voids compared to other regions. For larger halo masses, the trend disappears. We also analyse whether the properties of galaxies are sensitive to the type of voids that inhabit. This is done by separating voids embedded in overdense regions (S-type) from those that asymptotically converge to the average density of the Universe (R-type). We found that galaxies in R-type voids are bluer, with higher SFR and less concentration than in S-type voids. Our results indicate some degree of correlation of galaxy properties with the large-scale environment provided by voids, suggesting possible second-order mechanisms in galaxy evolution.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076350","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: groups: general;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We provide a new estimation of the average CNM filament aspect ratio with the consideration of force balances at the phase boundary, which is roughly 5–20 in common CNM environment. We show that most of the cold filaments are less filamentary than what usually predicted via MHD turbulence theory or inferred from observations: The average length of CNM filament is roughly 1/2 of that in isothermal MHD turbulence with similar turbulence conditions. This suggests that the ‘cold filaments’ that are identified in observations might not be in pressure equilibrium or generated via other mechanisms.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076309","ISM: atoms;ISM: evolution;ISM: structure","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We develop a simple yet comprehensive non-equilibrium chemical evolution model (NE-CEM) to constrain the mass-loading factor η of outflows using the metallicity-stellar mass–SFR relation observed by Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at z = 0. Our NE-CEM predicts the chemical enrichment by explicitly tracking both the histories of star formation and mass-loading. After exploring the EAGLE simulation, we discover a compact yet flexible model that accurately describes the average star formation histories of galaxies. Applying a novel method of chemically measuring η to EAGLE, we find η can be parametrized by its dependence on stellar mass and specific SFR as $\log \eta \propto M_*^{\alpha }s{\mathrm{SFR}}^{\beta }$, with α = − 0.12 and β = 0.32 in EAGLE. Our chemically inferred η agrees remarkably well with the kinematic measurements by Mitchell et al. After extensive tests with EAGLE, we apply an NE-CEM Bayesian analysis to the SDSS data, yielding a tight constraint of $\log (\eta /0.631) = 0.731{\pm }0.002\times (M_*/10^{9.5}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot })^{-0.222\pm 0.004} (s{\mathrm{SFR}}/10^{-9.5}\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1})^{0.078\pm 0.003}$, in good agreement with the down-the-barrel measurements. Our best-fitting NE-CEM not only accurately describes the metallicity-stellar mass–SFR relation at z = 0, but also successfully reproduce the so-called ‘fundamental metallicity relation’ at higher redshifts. Our results reveal that different galaxies form stars and enrich their gas in a non-equilibrium but strikingly coherent fashion across cosmic time.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076313","ISM: abundances;ISM: jets and outflows;galaxies: abundances;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: fundamental parameters;galaxies: ISM","","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is therefore imperative to employ novel techniques that can boost quantum fidelity in new ways. This paper aims to boost quantum fidelity with Clifford canary circuits by proposing Quancorde: Quantum Canary Ordered Diverse Ensembles, a fundamentally newapproach to identifying the correct outcomes of extremely low-fidelity quantum applications. It is based on the key idea of diversity in quantum devices - variations in noise sources, make each (portion of a) device unique, and therefore, their impact on an application's fidelity, also unique. Quancorde utilizes Clifford canary circuits (which are classically simulable, but also resemble the target application structure and thus suffer similar structural noise impact) to order a diverse ensemble of devices or qubits/mappings approximately along the direction of increasing fidelity of the target application. Quancorde then estimates the correlation of the ensemble-wide probabilities of each output string of the application, with the canary ensemble ordering, and uses this correlation to weight the application's noisy probability distribution. The correct application outcomes are expected to have higher correlation with the canary ensemble order, and thus their probabilities are boosted in this process.

These stations are easy to maintain and manage and can be run by low-income individuals to provide them with a business opportunity. The stations are designed to run independently from the electrical grid and thus be deployed in areas with less sophisticated infrastructure to achieve lower carbon emissions.

The Directional Phase Overcurrent Protection appears more important in the distribution system when the Overcurrent protection is the main protection. Any glitch in its setting can lead to opening the circuit in the non-faulty area or can perform non-trip in the faulty area. As an example in Algeria, this problem happens repeatedly in the plurality distribution substations. This reliable and selective protection is generally used in multisource networks, parallel transmission lines and mesh distribution networks. It is mainly characterized by its Maximum Torque Angle and Relay Characteristic Angle (RCA), also known as the directional angle as it decides the direction of the tripping zone. The variation of the RCA setting has a direct impact on the sensitivity operation of the relay (45 degrees' maximum sensitivity operation for any type of fault). Tests have been performed on The Four Step Directional Phase Overcurrent Protection Function of the Line Distance Protection REL670 ABB IED numerical relay. On one hand, the 51/67 ANSI protection has been tested and results were discussed.

However, codesign for novel circuits and systems that leverage inherent device stochasticity is a hard problem. This is mostly due to the large design space and complexity of doing so.

As the global push for energy transition to carbon-neutral energy sources continues, developing countries such as Nigeria need to formulate incentive policies to drive the growth and increase the share of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES). Nigeria experiences diverse energy challenges such as inadequate power supply with only about 13 GW of installed capacity to serve over 200 million people. The average per capita electricity consumption in the country in 2019 stood at 133 kWh. Therefore, for Nigeria, HRES is needed not just for energy transition but more importantly to bridge the huge electricity demand-supply gap. There are existing policies for the energy sector of the country such as the National Energy Policy and the National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy, but these policies have failed to achieve their key objectives hence the need for a review with a view to developing a policy that will incentivize renewable energy in the country. Therefore, this research examines the power situation in Nigeria and causes of failure of existing energy policies to drive the needed growth in renewable energy in the country and recommends how incentive policies can be developed and implemented to promote HRES in Nigeria. Incentives such as feed in tariffs, net-metering schemes amongst others have proven to stimulate the growth of renewable energy in some countries and can be adapted in Nigeria.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063841","Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) Nigeria; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063841","Energy;policy;HRES;electricity;incentives","Renewable energy sources;Costs;Power supplies;Tariffs;Legislation;Low-carbon economy;Developing countries","","","","","","21","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wind turbines are classified into two categories based on the axis orientation: horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). HAWT designs generally utilise lift force, and VAWT designs utilise drag force. Archimedes spiral wind turbine (ASWT) is a specialised design that falls under the HAWT classification, which uses both the lift and drag forces and hence possesses a low cut-in speed. Most of the existing wind turbine designs are permanent location designs. When travellers, hikers, adventurers, fishers, and the military are considered, they have to stay in remote areas for long durations. In that case, they might run out of power for their electronic mobile devices such as a mobile phones, where the need for a portable power generation device emerges. This paper attempts to describe the design concept of a portable and reconfigurable/foldable ASWT and a method for making a prototype. SOLIDWORKS software was used for designing and analysis of the ASWT. The simulation study was done, and the results were analysed for the strength of the proposed ASWT design. A wind speed of 13 m/s and 300 rpm of ASWT were considered to be the extreme operating conditions. To our knowledge gained from the existing literature, this is the first study that attempts to develop a portable and reconfigurable ASWT.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063804","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063804","Archimedes spiral wind turbine;Portable wind turbine;Foldable wind turbine;Wind Energy;Reconfigurable Wind turbine design","Analytical models;Spirals;Wind energy;Drag;Wind speed;Force;Prototypes","","","","","","26","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Mauritius, it is important to assess how the policy of energy transition is being put into practice and how progress has been achieved in the past recent years. This paper expresses the need to make energy transition a socially-adaptable issue where society members must learn and see how well they can adapt and live through the transition. While the Mauritian society expects going green and having a lower carbon footprint, it is advisable that the local community keeps pace with the progress undertaken and gets involved in such a transition. Through the depiction of a roadmap towards energy efficiency and sustainability, this paper explains that energy transition entails a better and greener economy and the strategy must be accompanied with citizen's engagement in the process.

With the latest technologies and speedy responses, the modernized systems could create inertia by properly and instantly coordinating and controlling many small plants. Further, accurate prediction algorithms release stress by giving advanced information about the system. It is a new direction of modernized control, and it always starts with a small design. It then integrates with an extensive system through a supervisory control loop. These incorporated technologies are opening several new opportunities for RE-based technologies. The research on micro-grid was initiated about two decades ago. It has been developed parallel with the possible development of RE technologies and prediction algorithms. The recent hike in fossil fuel costs pushes the micro-grid-based RE power generation to the front. Accordingly, this paper presents the coordinated control of a few RE power plants, using a micro-grid concept while integrating the micro-grid with the primary grid through the supervisory control concept.

A receding horizon optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the cost savings for the customer is solved to find these set points. The laboratory set-up consists of a PV system, battery bank, and a load. The PV system and the battery bank were connected to the AC bus via DC-AC converters. The EMS algorithm was implemented in LabView. Modbus/TCP over Ethernet connection was established between the LabView controller and the power electronic converters to get measurements and to send the set points. Measurements taken include voltage, current, and power from the DC-AC converters, and the set points include the charging/discharging power of the battery bank. Experiment was run over 48 hour period continuously. According to the experimental results, the EMS is able to control the charging and discharging of the battery bank as expected. When there are fast variations in either the load or PV production, the fluctuations were compensated by the grid for a short time, this is because the battery bank takes several seconds to respond.

This enables the system's continuous analog variables to converge to high-quality binary solutions to the optimization problem. Moreover, we establish an exact correspondence between the equations of motion for the coupled oscillators and the update rules in the primal-dual method of Lagrange multipliers.

One such method for producing renewable energy is wind turbines, which convert kinetic energy into useful electrical energy. As the world's biggest offshore wind energy market, the UK has been investing in green energy to mitigate the impacts of climate change. As part of the 2050 vision for net-zero emissions, the UK aims to boost the total installed offshore capacity by four-fold to 40GW by 2030. The energy conversion efficiency is primarily determined by the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine blades. By optimising the blade design, the maximum attainable energy can be produced. Biomimetics may aid in this optimisation by emulating the Humpback whales flipper morphology for aerodynamic applications. It has been hypothesised that leading-edge tubercles can increase the post-stall lift and reduce the induced drag. This paper analyses the aerodynamic characteristics of a NACA-0021 aerofoil with leading-edge tubercles. The analysis is conducted in the Northumbria University low-speed wind tunnel, aiming to compare the tubercle aerofoil's pressure distribution, lift, and stall angle against the smooth aerofoil.

Inspired by the success of classical neural networks (NNs), their quantum analog, commonly known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), are widely being investigated. Despite the significant interest, the literature still lacks some concrete evidence about QNN's superiority over their classical counterparts, especially in practical applications. This paper empirically demonstrates a greater capacity in hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) for a practical application, namely multi-class classification. In particular, we train both the HQNNs and their equivalent classical counterparts on the same data. We then benchmark the models' accuracy for quantifying model's capacity, where greater accuracy typically implies greater capacity. The results demonstrate a clear quantum advantage, i.e., greater capacity of HQNNs over their classical counterparts, where the HQNN models constantly achieve better accuracy. This superiority in performance by HQNNs serves as a foundational study for further investigation to magnify the quantum advantage in real-world applications of HQNNs.","","979-8-3503-4709-8","10.1109/ICRC57508.2022.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062518","Quantum computing;Quantum machine learning;Quantum neural networks;Quantum advantage;Hybrid algorithms","Training;Quantum computing;Machine learning algorithms;Neurons;Focusing;Artificial neural networks;Machine learning","","","","","","46","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many people are displaced from their homes and some even lose their life in such disasters. Mauritius has not been spared by these major issues and, as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) which is found under the tropics, the island is at a high risk of cyclones and torrential rains which may induce further land disasters. Another problem occurring worldwide is the landfill scarcity to dispose human, commercial, and industrial solid waste. The facilities for recycling municipal solid waste (MSW) in the country are very limited. Chemical stabilisation could potentially help solve both issues by combining binders with waste products to stabilise the soils in landslide-prone areas. The goal of this paper was to investigate the scope for an economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable solution to help mitigate the negative geotechnical events which come with climate change and also reducing the environmental problem of disposal and landfill scarcity. It was found that plastic wastes (14% of MSW), textile wastes (6% of MSW) and glass wastes (3% of MSW) in Mauritius were largely unrecycled and could partially be used in soil stabilisation.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063826","Soil stabilisation;landfill scarcity;municipal solid waste (MSW) management;sustainable materials","Waste management;Waste materials;Rain;Glass;Soil;Terrain factors;Cyclones","","","","","","39","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These employees will come from a variety of disciplines, cultures and backgrounds and will require a range of education and training to help us address climate change. Higher Education Institutions (HEI) will be a primary provider of this education/training and whilst there is an increasing number of renewable energy courses being developed, many of them focus on one discipline. They therefore potentially miss the benefits of multidisciplinary and intercultural group learning to help develop the “durable skills” required by industry [2]. This paper charts the on-going journey of an award-winning approach to learning [3] associated with the renewables sector that has been developed in Universities and industry in Europe. The Promoting Excellence in Employability and Transversal Skills (PEETS) initiative co-created a variety of innovative learning opportunities for students and staff enhancing both knowledge and skills development. Experiential and problem-based challenges through eg the construction of 5m tall wind turbines at a 10 day intensive study period, supported deeper learning through reflection. This initiative was awarded the prestigious Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence (CATE) by AdvanceHE in 2019.

They are primarily used in spiking neural network-based machine learning applications. However, neuromorphic computers are unable to preprocess data for these applications. Currently, data is preprocessed on a CPU or a GPU-this incurs a significant cost of transferring data from the CPU/GPU to the neuromorphic processor and vice versa. This cost can be avoided if preprocessing is done on the neuromorphic processor. To efficiently preprocess data on a neuromorphic processor, we first need an efficient mechanism for encoding data that can lend itself to all general-purpose preprocessing operations. Current encoding approaches have limited applicability and may not be suitable for all preprocessing operations. In this paper, we present the virtual neuron as a mechanism for encoding integers and rational numbers on neuromorphic processors. We evaluate the performance of the virtual neuron on physical and simulated neuromorphic hardware and show that it can perform an addition operation using 23 nJ of energy on average using a mixed-signal, memristor-based neuromorphic processor. The virtual neuron encoding approach is the first step in preprocessing data on a neuromorphic processor.","","979-8-3503-4709-8","10.1109/ICRC57508.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062742","Neuromorphic-Computing,-Spiking-Neural-Networks,-Encoding-Mechanisms,-General-Purpose-Neuromorphic-Computing,-Energy-Efficient-Computing,-Brain-Inspired-Computing,-Neuromorphic-Algorithms","Computers;Costs;Neuromorphics;Neurons;Machine learning;Extraterrestrial measurements;Encoding","","","","","","30","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from hub nodes, we demonstrate how to efficiently express a graph state through the generators of the stabilizer group. We provide examples by expressing the ring and the star topology, for which the number of stabilizers reduces from $n$ to $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$, and from $n$ to 1, respectively.

The framework has been split into three scenarios of EV uptake namely slow, medium and fast growths in the future EV fleet with an average battery of size of 40 kWh and a daily energy autonomy for 30 km revealed through a survey. Five sites have been identified around the island. Simulation results show that in order to satisfy the demand for EV vehicles, grid-tied PV modules need to be installed on 682,184 m2 of the available rooftops for slow growth, 294,109 $m$2for medium growth, and 511,773 m2 for rapid growth in 5 strategic zones identified around the island. The most optimistic uptake will require only 0.8% of all rooftop surfaces available as residential, commercial and industrial.

The greenhouse concept can be developed by adding a smart greenhouse system with Internet of Things (IoT) technology which can accelerate an accurate and expected plant cultivation system. This study introduces a smart greenhouse system for chili cultivation based on the IoT using website technology of NodeJS as an application interface and MongoDB as a database. The system that has been developed consists of several sensors designed to collect information related to the environmental conditions of the greenhouse. These sensors are Total Dissolved Solid/TDS (water turbidity) sensor, Dissolved Oxygen Sensor (Oxygen content), DHT11 (air temperature and humidity), pH sensor (soil pH), soil moisture sensor (soil moisture), and ultrasonic sensor (to measure the distance from the water surface). The system is developed using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Data from the sensor is delivered to the Raspberry Pi 3B and the server passes through the internet network to be stored in the database. Testing of the DHT11 sensor produces an average air temperature of 26°C and air humidity of 62% which affects the growth of chili plants while the results of testing the water pH data are 6.36 mg/l. The value of the oxygen content (Dissolved Oxygen (DO)) is 0 - 2.141 ppm while the value of the Water Level data in the reservoir is 14.7 - 19.2 cm. Testing of water turbidity uses TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor. This test is performed to ensure good water quality for chili plants which is in the range of 3 - 3.5 ppm.

Current research has shown that additional energy savings can be achieved through the application of an eco-driving system in electromobility using friction models and energy consumption patterns. Results indicate an approximate improvement in energy savings over traditional eco-driving strategies, particularly on trajectories with high traffic density.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063838","French agency ANR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063838","eco-driving;electric vehicles;electromobility;energy consumption;traffic model","Energy consumption;Biological system modeling;Friction;Transportation;Electric vehicles;Trajectory;Batteries","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, QUBO has been discovered to be compatible with two emerging computing paradigms, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, with tremendous potential to speed up future optimization solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel neuromorphic computing paradigm that employs multiple collaborative spiking neural networks to solve QUBO problems. Each SNN conducts a local stochastic gradient descent search and shares the global best solutions periodically to perform a meta-heuristic search for optima. We simulate our model and compare it to a single SNN solver and a mult-SNN solver without collaboration. Through tests on benchmark problems, the proposed method is demonstrated to be more efficient and effective in searching for QUBO optima.

In this work, two scenarios were developed. The business as usual (BAU) scenario refers to the trend scenario based on the import of conventional fuel. Whereas, the biomass scenario favours electricity self-sufficiency in 2030 by replacing coal and oil with local biomass and waste. Results show that by setting intermittent production at 30%, electrical autonomy in 2030 can be achieved through high levels of production from biomass and waste, which will represent 57.61% of total electricity production. Moreover, the biomass-based scenario has a low production cost and a low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate compared to BAU scenario. The integration of biomass and waste into the electricity system leads to a 91% and 91.6% reduction in the cost of electricity and GHG emission respectively in 2030.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063740","Long-term energy planning;energy selfsufficiency;renewable energy;LEAP;Reunion Island;Biomass gasification","Analytical models;Costs;Oils;Biological system modeling;Production;Coal;Wind power generation","","","","","","33","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper first analyses the current CHP and grid energy system and presents the electricity demand and the equivalent carbon emissions of the Old Aberdeen campus. Then the potential for renewable electricity generation is explored which includes an assessment of the wind energy resources, solar irradiance, potential locations for solar panel installation on the University property, and the potential of micro-hydro installations on the river Don. The electricity demand and the renewable energy data are then used to find the most cost-effective HRES configurations for multiple energy scenarios using MOHRES software. The most cost-effective HRES solution in the context of the Old Aberdeen campus achieves net-zero electricity at an investment cost of 7.1 M£ which is paid back in 25 years with an overall energy cost of 0.18 £/kWh. This cost is 14.3% lower than the current cost of electricity supplied by the grid.

However, the photovoltaic solar cells used for primary solar energy conversion into electrical energy exhibited significant drawbacks. The fundamental downside is unstable and low efficiency with the energy conversion process being negatively affected by a range of factors. To neutralize or minimize the impact of those factors causing energy losses, researchers have come out with varied ideas. One of promising solutions offered by researchers is hybrid photovoltaic-thermoelectric generator system combining both photovoltaic cells and thermoelectric generators advantages. The proposed hybrid system model was constructed and tested for its energy conversion capability under a variety of the exposition angles to the solar irradiation with concurrent examination of the temperature distribution inside proposed structure. It was found that increase of the exposition angle of the structure to an irradiation source causes the decrease of the temperature gradient $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \mathbf{T}$ between the system layers as well as reduces overall system heating. The temperature gradient's reduction influences negatively the voltage generation process. The experiments showed that for the exposition angles in the range from $\boldsymbol{0^{\circ}}$ to $\boldsymbol{45^{\circ}}$ the generated voltage exposition angle dependence is reflected closely by the linear characteristics. It was estimated that the voltage generated by thermoelectric generator structure charged with the optimal load determined and applied, would drop by approximately 0.82% per each 1°degree of the exposition angle increase. The $\mathbf{Vgen}/\Delta \mathbf{T}$ ratio was established, which takes the upward trend increasing by 4.46 $\mathbf{mV}/{}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ for the maximum $\Delta \mathbf{T}$ and 3.67 $\mathbf{mV}/{}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ for the average $\Delta \mathbf{T}$ with each degree of the exposition angle increase. Evaluated factors and ratios could be used by other researchers for design and evaluation of the similar hybrid systems.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063811","renewable energy;thermoelectric generators;photovoltaic systems;hybrid systems;energy conversion","Maximum power point trackers;Photovoltaic systems;Renewable energy sources;Radiation effects;Temperature distribution;Photovoltaic cells;Voltage","","","","","","13","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, pre-commercial technologies like wave power do not tend to be incorporated into distributed HRES models or are considered widely as a potential contributor to a future net-zero system, due to the lack of available data on their power and cost characteristics. In this paper an attempt has been made to develop a methodology for cost and power modelling of a wave energy device, utilising available data for the Pelamis P2 wave energy converter (WEC) as a test case. It is to date the most commercially successful WEC and as such has a greater availability of literature in relation to cost and power characteristics. By designing a power and cost modelling methodology independent from the wave behaviour in a given geography the procedure presented in this paper could be readily adapted and applied to future wave energy devices, installed in any location, where there is sufficient resource, cost and power data available to enable their integration into a HRES model.

One of the problems in the network is network congestion or network failure. Network congestion occurs due to the need for network resources exceeding the capacity of network resources. When network congestion occurs, the NDN forwarding mechanism facilitated by FIB on the IP router cannot detect the congestion condition and will still use the same path. At the same time, the NDN router can detect congestion conditions and react by using alternative paths. The simulation results show that on the NDN router, the forwarding mechanism can maximize the use of link bandwidth faster than the forwarding mechanism on the router-based IP network.

This technology is able to sense the surrounding environment and control the vehicle autonomously without any human intervention. In its implementation, this technology requires a lot of information, especially the road track that will be passed. Because of that, the thing that must be considered is to segment the road first. The aim of this research is to develop a method that can segment the roads to produce a model that can recognize the road track as well. This research uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with U-Net architecture. The datasets have a form of car trips video recordings from the dashboard camera, which are then extracted into a frame. After this process, it is annotated or manual segmentation using Supervisely to be used as a reference for training and testing. From the results of the calculation process with the confusion matrix, the accuracy of the U-net architecture gets a value of 95%, precision value is 81%, recall value is 92%, F1-Score value is 86% IOU value is 76%. Followed by testing the model in real-time using Jetson AGX Xavier, this tool is specially designed to develop artificial intelligence with high specifications. The test is carried out with two types of testing. The first test with an RGB background produces an FPS of 0.17, and the second test without an RGB background gets an FPS in the range of 0.55-0.67.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063891","Autonomous Vehicle;road segmentation;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);U-Net;Supervisely;Jetson AGX Xavier","Training;Roads;Cameras;Real-time systems;Trajectory;Telecommunications;Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work evaluates the impact of select and memory device properties on the results of analog matrix-vector multiplications. We integrate nonlinear circuit simulations into CrossSim and perform end-to-end neural network inference simulations to study how the select device affects the accuracy of neural network inference. We propose an adjustment to the input voltage that can effectively compensate for the electrical load of the select device. Our results show that for deep residual networks trained on CIFAR-10, a compensation that is uniform across all devices in the system can mitigate these effects over a wide range of values for the select device I-V steepness and memory device On/Off ratio.

The proposed UWB antenna configuration uses RO3450 dielectric substrate with a thickness of 1.524mm with a relative permittivity of 3.6. The results obtained show that the antenna with resistive load and DGS is capable of having a UWB frequency. The reflection coefficient obtained is following the FCC minimum standards from 3.1GHz - 10.6GHz. The radiation pattern obtained when the antenna is added with resistive load and slot at the ground plane is relatively similar. However, the gain of the antenna with resistive load and slot at the ground plane is better than the antenna that only uses resistive load. The highest gain of the antenna can reach 7dB when using a resistive load of 50Ω.

The study focuses on improving the current heat network and reviewing options to replace the existing gas boilers with low-carbon heat technologies. This study concludes that the pipework for the network should be upgraded as this would allow the heat network to move from the current 3G District Network (high temperature) to a 4G District Network (lower temperature). This reduces carbon emissions but also enables the use of low-carbon technology. It also concludes that heat pumps, biomass, and extension of other nearby heat networks are heat technologies that meet the main objective of reducing carbon emissions and which could be a practical solution at Hillhead given further study.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063823","Decarbonising Heating Systems;District Heat Networks;DHN;Heat Pumps","Heating systems;Costs;Heat pumps;Hydrogen;Heat engines;Carbon dioxide;Boilers","","","","","","24","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This compact rotative system is designed to be used in the Northumbria University's wind tunnel, providing a choice of steady or oscillating angles for the testing of models including blades, airfoils, vehicles, etc. Thanks to a table diameter of 600mm (interchangeable for bigger models). Unlike a traditional mechanical system, it is able to conduct unsteady testing of the model by creating a user-defined angle oscillation for a variety of reduced frequencies. The rotary movement of the turntable will be achieved by a two-phase stepper motor with a resolution of 200 steps per $\boldsymbol{360^{\circ}}$ at the maximal velocity of 3000rpm. A simple but uncluttered LabViewinterface with a motor program will control the system. The accuracy of the turntable is 2% per degree, driven by a belt transmission with a ratio of 1:1.8 which results in each motor step rotating the table by one degree. It is expected to achieve a table rotation velocity of 60 degrees per second with an oscillating frequency that can reach 16 Hertz. The turntable has a height of 76mm to reduce impact on the airflow during three-dimensional testing. During two-dimensional testing, a raised platform is built to simulate the table being flush with the tunnel floor. A compact design with minimal effect on airflow allows the system to be used in several different orientations, such as horizontally on the tunnel floor, inverted on the ceiling, or vertically on the side walls.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063787","Timing Belt;Aerodynamic;Ratio;Wind;Motor;Blade;Programming","Wind tunnels;Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Blades;Control systems;Belts;Timing","","","","","","11","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BLDC motor has the advantages of high efficiency, good speed and torque characteristics, low operating noise, and long operating life. BLDC motor requires a control system which can improve a stable and responsive speed response to maximize these advantages. This research discusses controlling BLDC motor speed with Proportional Integral (PI) control and Field Oriented Control (FOC) methods based on Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The initial stage of the research is to simulate the PI control to see the results of control before it is implemented on the BLDC motors. The simulation results show that the value of Kp is 0.01165 and Ki is 0.10699. This research also applies the FOC method using the Texas Instruments Insta SPIN-FOC library and the implementation uses the DSP TMS320F28027F. The results obtained indicate that the response is good with a small overshoot value and steady state error so that it produces an output with low ripple and fast response. The designed control system is capable of tracking speed at 500 rpm, 700 rpm and 900 rpm setpoints. The BLDC motor speed test for each setpoint results a settling time value of 0.30 s, 0.18 s and 0.14 s, an overshoot value of 0.2%, 1.14% and 0.22% and a steady state error value by 1 %, 0% and 0.22%.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063899","Speed control system;BLDC Motor;PI;DSP","Torque;Brushless DC motors;Simulation;Velocity control;Digital signal processors;Control systems;Regulation","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a word is transliterated, it is shifted from one script to another. In contrast to a translation, which clarifies the meaning of a word written in a different language, a transliteration only conveys the word's pronunciation by utilizing a familiar alphabet. This paper proposes a technique for creating a bilingual automated tool to type Sanskrit using English orthography/alphabets and converting Sanskrit text into the script of English which helps in reading the Sanskrit text for those who are not aware about the orthography of Sanskrit language. The system receives input via the QWERTY keyboard, which produces the equivalent Sanskrit text and inversely user can give Sanskrit text as input to get equivalent text using the script of English language. The goal is to create an easy-to-use and robust automated solution that allows end-users to effortlessly type Sanskrit shlokas or sentences using an English keyboard. The suggested approach is unique in that it is based on the language's Unicode and works for the low-resource ancient language Sanskrit. The primary applications of the designed tool are to help user to read Sanskrit text using the script/orthography of English, to create parallel corpora for the Sanskrit language translation process, to create e-versions of manuscripts written in Sanskrit language as the majority of ancient knowledge is not available on the internet, and to make it easy to learn Sanskrit language by any individual or students at the school level.

The fast growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought to light significant privacy protection problems. This has a tremendous impact on the large-scale IoT applications. In this study, a ground-breaking IOT computing platform for secure and knowledgeable healthcare monitoring services is introduced. Within an IoT architecture, fully homomorphism encryption (FHE), which protects data privacy, is handled and kept. For the proposed IoT framework, a distributed method for clustering-based approaches is created with the scalability to gather and independently analyse massive amounts of hetrogeneous data in distributed IoT devices before it is transferred to the cloud. In this study, the Cluster Heads (CHs) were chosen from the available IoT devices using a brand-new Efficient Ant Colony Optimization (EACO) technique. For healthcare surveillance, fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCMC) is employed. FCM allows us to recognise regular (typical) bio signal patterns.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060099","Efficient Ant Colony Optimization;Fully Homomorphism Encryption;Internet of Things;Fuzzy C-Means clustering","Cloud computing;Ant colony optimization;Data privacy;Smart cities;Surveillance;Wireless networks;Scalability","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a disorder that causes the ovaries to enlarge due to the presence of cysts. PCOS can be detected by using various techniques like blood tests, pelvic examination and ultrasound imaging. These clinical methods are time consuming, costly and the results generated by them are also prone to human errors. These issues can further lead to low efficiency in the generated results and also hamper in the diagnosis of PCOS. Therefore an automated system for the detection of PCOS can be used to overcome these limitations. An automated system can be useful for medical practitioners to detect PCOS in less time and hence reducing the risk of human errors. In our approach to the detection of PCOS, artificial intelligence techniques which include machine learning, transfer learning and various deep learning techniques play a very important role. For the diagnosis of PCOS various AI techniques are used like segmentation, classification and detection through various classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression etc. This paper reviews existing works in which segmentation, detection and classification is done simultaneously to create an automated system for diagnosis of PCOS through the dataset of ultrasound imaging.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10064817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064817","PCOS;Detection;Machine Learning;Ultrasound;Segmentation;Classification","","","","","","","24","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the reasons for increasing water demand is boarding houses. The water consumption limit for luxury boarding houses is 123.45 liters/person/day; for medium boarding houses, it is 120.52 liters/person/day, and for simple boarding houses, 115.86 liters/person/day. In this study, a water usage monitoring system was designed using an Internet of Things-based application to monitor water discharge and volume via a smartphone. This system uses a water flow sensor, solenoid valve, and Arduino Uno ATMega microcontroller, which is communicated serially with the ESP8266, a two-channel relay, and a water pump so that water can flow quite fast. The monitoring system designed can calculate the water discharge and the volume of water usage for boarding house residents per day with a water usage limit of 123 liters/person/day. If the boarding house occupants use water exceeding the predetermined limit, the excess water usage fee will be charged to the house occupant. This monitoring system is implemented in 2 rooms in a boarding house. Based on the tests that have been carried out, the average water consumption in Room 1 is 123.72 liters, with an average water flow of 22.41 liters/min. In comparison, the average water consumption in Room 2 is 116.54 liters, with an average water discharge of 21.48 liters/min. Then the accuracy value of the water discharge is 99.88%, the water volume is 98.88% in Room 1, the accuracy value of the water discharge is 99.85%, and the water volume is 95.19% in Room 2. This shows that the monitoring system can work according to the design, where the monitoring system can display the daily water usage of boarding house residents through the Blynk application. Then the monitoring result data is sent to the user via email that the occupant has registered on the Blynk application.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063876","monitoring system;water discharge;water volume;internet of things","Microcontrollers;Valves;Water pumps;Internet;Telecommunications;Relays;Statistics","","","","","","14","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An alternative is High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS), which was studied extensively in the 1990s and 2000s, and is now returning to public attention. In this study, we firstly determine the optimal HAPS position assuming equal power allocation to each User Equipment (UE) in order to maximize the downlink Sum Rate given a backhaul link constraint and minimum data rate of each UE. HAPS operates at the 28 GHz millimeter-wave band with an altitude of 20 km. The antenna configuration is Uniform Planar Array (UPA) with varying number of elements. The number of UE is fixed but randomly distributed in an area of 100x100 km2. The area is divided into 100 equal-sized grids, from which the HAPS location will be varied for optimization purpose. The simulation results indicate that the optimal location is grid number 29 when the antenna element is 16x16. Increasing the antenna element to 128x128 results in higher data rate for each UE. After determining the optimal HAPS location, power allocation for each UE is carried out to fulfill the backhaul link constraint. From several power combinations for each UE, the combination that has the minimum total power is taken. Thus, as the array elements increase, the total minimum power will decrease.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063916","HAPS position;data rate;millimeter-wave","Satellites;Simulation;Planar arrays;Downlink;Resource management;Arrays;Millimeter wave communication","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Only a few studies reported the reconstruction of the signals on SRC's algorithm. Therefore, this paper studies the comparison of OMP, LASSO, and CVX to help the readers understand the reconstruction algorithm's effect on SRC. The simulation result is that LASSO and CVX algorithms have the same recognition rate, but LASSO can compute twice faster as CVX.

In the process of making coffee, a robotic arm requires a minimum of 3 to 4 joints (3 to 4-DOF) to do the job of imitating a human arm. The forward kinematics method uses kinematic equations to determine the joints of the robot so that the final coordinates of its movement can be determined.

While these magnetic fields protect humans and bring convenience to life, they also drown out some weak magnetic signals that are rich in content, such as neural currents and other biomagnetic fields with high research significance. These signals are of high scientific research value, and the design of magnetic field shielding devices is a very important aspect in order to study these signals. In the design of shielding devices, in addition to the size limitation requirements of the relevant area, there are also different optimization requirements for the selection of shielding materials, quality, structural performance and cost of the shielding solution, which is a typical multi-objective or super multi-objective optimisation problem. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the optimisation of shielding cylinders (SC) based on artificial neural networks. A cylindrical shape is chosen as the final shape of the MSC. This paper analyses the material selection of the MSD and the shape of the MSC, and investigates the shielding coefficient of the multi-layer MSC; the analysis of the shielding effectiveness of different shapes of the SC shows that the rectangular body is slightly better than the cylindrical shape. However, the rectangular shape takes up more space, has more consumables and is costlier to manufacture. Therefore, the cylindrical shape was chosen as the final shape of the MSC. A three-layer MSC with the optimised dimensions in Table 4 was designed and simulated, and the centre point shielding coefficient of the three-layer MSC was 144.085dB with a remanence of less than 0.01nT, meeting the design requirements.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060723","artificial neural networks;shielding cylinder;shielded cartridge optimization;performance analysis","Performance evaluation;Time-frequency analysis;Costs;Shape;Artificial neural networks;Permeability;Magnetic fields","","","","","","14","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Surface energy is a dominant factor that affects surface wettability. The most common way of determining the surface energy is by measuring the contact angle of the liquid on the surface. Depending mostly on the contact angle of the droplet, the surface is further characterized as hydrophobic or hydrophilic. A hydrophilic surface attracts water strongly, whilst a hydrophobic surface repels water strongly. The material surface is considered to be extremely hydrophilic once the contact angle of liquid is less than 10°, hydrophilic when it has less than 90°, hydrophobic when it is larger than 90°, and extremely hydrophobic when it is more than 150°. Learning about surface wettability is crucial as the surface of any instrumentation is what comes in contact with the environment and is the most vulnerable to environmental effects. The outcome of this review will lead to a concise comparison and description of new methodologies and choosing the most appropriate image classification model for predicting surface wettability of surfaces in an economical and hassle-free manner. Neural networks are a powerful tool for the advancement of material characterization methods. This paper reviewed related studies to find the machine learning algorithms used for predicting wettability and the techniques employed. This is done to make the process of indicating the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the surface simpler. Neural networks to predict the nature of a material based on its interaction with the given liquid have also been reviewed, under this, a comparative study between three major image classification algorithms namely convolution neural network(CNN), Recurrent neural network(RNN), and Artificial neural network(ANN) is done to find the most suited algorithm for the specific use case.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10064943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064943","Wettability;Machine Learning;Contact Angle;Image Classification;Neural Network","","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper takes the multimodal features of mobile short video as the research object and li Ziqi series of short videos as the research corpus. Based on the self-built multi-modal corpus, using visual grammar theory, this paper discusses how mobile short video makes various symbols and modes cooperate to construct multi-modal discourse and achieve its communicative purpose. Through the research, we find that the auditory modes of Li Ziqi series short videos are mainly composed of music and sound symbols, and there are few language symbols, which have no function of constructing meaning. The visual modes of Liziqi series of short videos are composed of video, subtitles, works logo and other symbols. The reappearance is reflected in the scenes of Li Ziqi working hard or eating food, as well as the display of natural landscape, farm yard and the fruits of her labor. The interactive significance reflects that the image of Li Ziqi in the picture is mostly “offer” images, which appear alternately in the long shot, middle shot, close shot and close-up shot. She uses the side flat shot or the vantage shot to shoot in order to build an equal and friendly harmonious relationship. The meaning of composition is reflected in the video designer's use of lens language to put the content to be represented in an important and significant position of new information, so that the design intention can be effectively conveyed.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060695","convergence media;digital communication;discourse;mobile short video;multimodal;visual grammar","Visualization;Social networking (online);Layout;Symbols;Music;Lighting;Media","","","","","","12","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have various constructions, which may be huge, i.e., a massive project, or just the smaller ones. Here, smaller sites could be handled by the owner himself or his team of few workers by giving instructions and doing the tasks to manage the whole area. Analyzing the enormous construction sites, we may take the instance of constructing residential buildings or a mall; we require an efficient management system to keep an eye on finance, supplies, waste, workers, machines, managers, timings, etc., so, at times, it is challenging for the owner as well as the architect or managers (assigned for the project). As they have to manage this massive lot of work, it might create chaos if an effective management system is not implemented. Also, it may lead to monetary loss and delay in construction, resulting in losing clients and brand reputation. With the help of IoT amalgamated with a Database Management System, one can save time, money, and energy. Hence, without any doubt, efficiency and safety are the vast aspects of IoT in the construction industry and are also the prime goal of this research methodology.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10059858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059858","Database Management System;Internet of Things;Projects;Safety;Wireless Network","Knowledge engineering;Wireless networks;Finance;Database systems;Safety;Delays;Internet of Things","","","","","","27","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One problem with existing research is that less work has been accomplished on using phonology for understanding spoken text. We suggest using early fusion of phone embeddings to recognize accented speech from a small sample dataset. Using PocketSphinx, the phonemes are recovered from the .WAV recordings. FastText's character n-gram based subword embeddings transforms the phonemes into vectors. To keep the vectors uniform, we concatenated and padded the vectors. The accuracy of the early fusion of phone embeddings for accented speech recognition is 49.01% for 10 sentence categories of the L2- ARCTIC accented speech corpus, which is higher than the accuracy of existing techniques. We seek to prove through our work that audio phonemes can play a significant role in accented speech recognition even when the number of training samples are few.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10064735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064735","accented speech recognition;phone embeddings;early fusion","","","","","","","37","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These cells that are sensitive to different colors respond differently to various light wavelengths. The cells can’t be rectified in any way. This suggests color blindness cannot be cured. The primary focus of this research is on the following types of color deficiencies including complete color-blindness and dichromatic color-blindness—red-green, blue-yellow. In this paper, the authors use Image-Processing-Techniques (IPT) to make Ishihara-Test-Images (a test to identify partial and total color deficiency) perceptible to people with color-vision difficulties. The use of advanced image processing techniques (IPT) and mathematical operations on the pixels of an image can solve vision defects.

The single or double trailer (vessel) that the Volvo FH16 prime mover truck is equipped to pull may weigh between 280 metric tons. Unfortunately, the Service-Meter (SM), which counts engine operating hours without accounting for engine speed, load, or oil temperature, serves as the primary basis for the maintenance schedule. As a result of this faulty parameter, the maintenance schedule became inefficient and flawed. A NodeMCU Module is installed on an ECU to include crankshaft rotation to Hour Meter parameter which used to decide when to carried out the periodic maintenance. The wear components inside the engine that is in contact with rotating or moving parts such as crankshaft, camshaft, piston cylinders specifically the rings, cylinder liner, and connecting rod are all depend on the number of crankshaft rotation. By including the crankshaft RPM when the engine is operating, using SMconv, The most frequent maintenance service (PS250) is carried out approximately every 11 days (previously every 15 days). By making PS250 more frequent which means replacement of engine oil, engine oil filter, and secondary fuel filter (racor filter) will be done more frequently. The result and effect of the maintenance is therefore in accordance with metal wear pace inside the engine. Therefore, by modifying the SM parameter the more frequent maintenance service is expected to make make better MTBF and MTTR thus resulting in longer engine lifetime.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063901","Volvo D16C610 engine;NodeMCU;Modified Hour Meter","Meters;Schedules;Metals;Prototypes;Maintenance engineering;Lubricating oils;Real-time systems","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since it has a wide range of applications, gait analysis has recently become one of the most significant medical fields. Many new computer-vision-based methods have been developed to lower the cost of motion-capturing equipment. Recent improvements in two-dimensional video posture estimation show that gait analysis could be done using footage from devices that are easy to get (like smartphones). A markerless gait analysis system can look at how a person walks to determine the most effective way to treat them. But the markerless algorithms we have now aren’t very accurate, and gait analysis gets harder when people wear long clothes that cover the joints. In this work, we looked at how different clothing designs affect knee angle trajectories and how well the OpenPose-based bottom-up pose estimation method can find the coordinates of the subject’s joints when the subject is wearing loose clothing. The system used a typical smartphone camera that took pictures at 320 x 640 pixels at an average rate of 30 frames per second. Six healthy participants, four men, and two women, dressed differently for the study. The angles at which the knees bend and straighten in traditional Indian clothing differ from those in regular clothing. The comparisons are made between the traditional outfit’s mean, standard deviation, and root mean square error.

The security of the IoT network has grown in importance as the popularity of the Internet of Things increases daily. An IoT network is more secure thanks to encryption and authentication, yet it can be challenging to defend IoT devices from online threats. Cyberattacks on the Internet of Things system not only result in data loss, but they also have the potential to bring the entire system to a standstill. The performance of the network can be negatively impacted by hostile activities, which are easily detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS).

A movie recommendation system is a useful tool/software that aids users in rapidly obtaining optimum results with comparable interests. Using the Firefly clustering technique, this study focuses on a movie recommendation system whose major goal is to propose movies of comparable interest to the active user. Although much study has been done in the topic of recommendation systems, there are still several issues with producing suitable results. To address these issues, we suggested a strategy that uses a meta-heuristic approach to get optimal outcomes. Instead of utilising K-means, fuzzy C-means, and other algorithms, we present the Firefly clustering method in this research to provide the best optimum outcomes in recommendation systems. For performance analysis, many measurements such as t-value, RMSE, SD, and MAE are utilised.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10064743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064743","MAE;T-value;SD;Collaborative filtering;RMS;WCSS","","","","","","","22","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method is expected to stabilize the table position with a set point angle of 0° on the x (roll) and y (pitch) axes. This balancing system uses the MPU-6050 sensor, Arduino UNO as a microcontroller, and two servo motors as actuators on each axis that maintain the table position at the set point. Mechanical design is needed to support the optimization of the system's performance. The implementation of the control parameter values from the manual tuning carried out obtained values on the x (roll) axis, namely Kp = 10, Ti= 0.192, and Td= 0.0487.

This pre-processing increases the accuracy of any function. Removal of silence and unwanted voice is especially important in case of health care where doctors’ voice is not required. The proposed Patient’s Audio Recognition and Segmentation Model (PARSM) elaborates an end-to-end methodology for removing silence as well as voice of the virtual interviewer from DIAC-WOZ dataset. This model not only ensures creation of new audio file but also checks for eligibility of audio for being segmentable on the basis of close proximity of voices. In the dataset the volume levels of voice of interviewer and a patient is distinguishable. This fact is utilized in the model as it uses Short Time Energy as a feature. The binary classification is done using Support Vector Machine (SVM). After the calculation of STE, the signal is classified as either low energy or high energy signals. High energy signals, which depict voice of the patient, are then concatenated together to get desired output audio signal. Also, the weight factor can also be varied for each audio manually depending upon the requirement of strictness of segmentation for each audio.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10065116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10065116","silence removal;audio separation;audio segmentation;PARSM;short time energy;support vector machine","","","","","","","19","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The flood caused a lot of losses for the community, this is because the garbage that has accumulated in the waterways makes it difficult for the water to flow and when it rains enough it can cause the canal to be unable to accommodate a lot of water so it overflows onto the road and causes floods to occur. From this condition, a system is needed that aims to monitor the height and turbidity of the water. This research will be designed using NodeMCU as a microcontroller and communication with android applications via the internet. The method used is a literature study by collecting data related to the problem, analyzing needs for research, designing tools, testing, analyzing systems and documentation, and compiling research reports.

However, it is essential to have a good performance of low complexity synchronization and channel equalization (CE) of it to fully reap the advantageous features. A simple method to solve CE is the least square (LS), but it requires pilot symbols, thus degrading the frame efficiency. Commonly, the CE techniques assume perfect synchronization, which is not practical. A method utilizing the adaptive filter is able to jointly solve the synchronization and channel issue, but at a cost of high complexity. To address the issue, a technique that maximizes the utilization of preamble is proposed. A preamble constructed by deterministic sequence is treated as pilots, and can be used for joint synchronization and CE. Here, no pilot should be inserted among the payload. The performance is observed similar to conventional LS technique, but at frame efficiency of3.76% higher.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063873","Channel Impulse Response;GFDM;Preamble;Synchronization;Zadoff Chu Sequence","5G mobile communication;OFDM;Symbols;Channel estimation;MIMO;Complexity theory;Telecommunications","","","","","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the important contents of chemical machinery. The purpose of this paper is to study the modeling and simulation of chemical mechanical properties based on GA-Bp algorithm. Traditional chemical- mechanical models do not have the ability to simulate, and the results obtained are often very inaccurate. To address this problem, a new chemical-mechanical performance model based on the GA-Bp algorithm is developed in this paper. GA-Bp algorithm has the advantages of Bp algorithm and genetic algorithm at the same time, and it is easy to use. Combined with the breadth of the Bp algorithm and the characteristics of the genetic algorithm full search algorithm, combined with the general ability, mapping ability and full search ability of the two algorithms, a neural network training algorithm was developed. The GA-Bp algorithm reduces the search for the best solution by increasing the size of the unit, thereby increasing the number of training sessions for neural network training. The experimental results show that the chemical model based on the GA-Bp algorithm is more accurate. Experiments have proved that the gap between the chemical mechanical performance model of this paper and the traditional pure Bp is about 3–4 times, and the prediction performance speed can be reduced to 1/10 compared with the traditional algorithm.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060637","artificial neural network;chemical machinery;performance modeling;simulation research","Training;Analytical models;Uncertainty;Oils;Refining;Prediction algorithms;Complexity theory","","","","","","12","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, machine translation (MT) has improved above and beyond the norm and is now typically performed utilising supervised learning approaches. Due to the paucity of comparable corpora for Sanskrit, new research in the unsupervised MT domain appears to have promise for Sanskrit. With the aid of manually created parallel corpora for the Sanskrit-Hindi language pair, an analysis is conducted between various modelling techniques of building a machine translation system, namely Statistical and Neural, in order to bridge the gap between Sanskrit and its contemporary successor Hindi.

Therefore, this study focusses on the use of phonocardiogram (PCG) data as a means of detecting heart abnormalities through machine learning approach. This study would concentrate on the use of phonocardiogram signals to detect abnormalities such as murmur, extrasystole, which are frequently cited in literature as early indicator for numerous CVD related illness. A sixth order Butterworth filter with a frequency range of 25Hz – 900Hz was used to remove undesired signal followed by a zerophased digital filter. The signal was then segmented using average Shannon energy. Both morphological features as well as non-linear features derived from Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was used to analyze the PCG signals. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to select the statistically significant features for classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ensemble and K Nearest- Neighbor (KNN) classifiers were used to quantify the efficacy of the proposed methods in detecting heart abnormalities. Overall accuracy of 70.2 % was achieved using the proposed features and Ensemble classifier.

This paper proposes two deep learning models for detecting PD. The first model proposed is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on hand drawn images. The second model is a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model trained using time series signals of hand drawings. The proposed models are trained using the benchmark NewHandPD dataset which consists of hand drawn images and its corresponding time series signals of both the healthy and PD subjects.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10065159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10065159","CNN;LSTM;Parkinson’s Disease","","","","","","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Epilepsy is a brain disorder caused due to an imbalance of electrical activity of neural cells. It has extreme effects on the lives of patients including psychological and emotional distress. In severe cases, people suffer from less mobility and their social lives get disrupted. Prediction of Epilepsy can reduce it's impact on the patient with the help of medical assistance. Traditional methods to predict Epilepsy are vulnerable to error. Machine Learning can provide results with better accuracy and performance. Besides this, detection of Epilepsy is cumbersome and it needs a medical expert for diagnosis. This delays the time for treatment. An early diagnosis can improve the lives of patients drastically. EEG ( Electroencephalogram) is used for the purpose of recording electrical signals from the brain. Multiple electrodes are placed on the scalp of the patient at different points to collect electrical impulses. This paper focuses on different Machine Learning models to compare their performance and accuracy. EEG signals are present in the time domain. In order to obtain data about electrical signals from the frequency domain as well we have used DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform). DWT decomposes the signal into sub bands. The decomposed data is fed into feature selection models followed by machine learning models like ANN, KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10065163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10065163","Epilepsy;Epileptic Seizure;ANN;KNN;ML","","","","","","","14","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in the case of tables presented in the image document, steps are needed first to detect the table. Seeing a table in image documents becomes more complicated if the table to be seen does not have clear boundaries. This research focuses on extracting information from borderless tables in image documents. The study applies the Mask RCNN-FPN deep learning model to detect borderless tables using augmentation data. The use of data augmentation is expected to increase the accuracy of deep learning models even though there is only a small amount of training data available. The data augmentation technique proposed in this study is a fine-tuning method with CutMask augmentation data. For model formation and testing, this study uses the UNLV data set. This data set consists of scanned images of documents from various sources, including financial reports, journals, and different tabular research papers. The total amount of data used is 427 samples. After data augmentation, the amount of data used is 854 samples. The table detection model is based on the Mask RCNN created using Python. The testing parameters used for table detection quality are precise detection, partial detection, false detection, Precision, Recall, and F-Measure. The table's structure recognition rate is measured from the detection intersection value, rows, columns, and cells compared to ground truth. The test results show that using data augmentation with the CutMask technique can improve the performance of deep learning models to detect borderless tables. The use of image processing is shown to enhance table segmentation. However, the table structure recognition result does not offer a good result compared to the effects of other research.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063909","table information extraction;table detection;data augmentation;deep learning;mask RCNN-FPN;image processing;Computer vision","Deep learning;Image segmentation;Training data;Information retrieval;Data models;Telecommunications;Data mining","","","","","","13","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Making best use of wind energy involves learning the trends in which it generates power. When the power generated is more than the power demand, the power grid often fails, causing disconnection to the dependent parties and sometimes even expensive mishaps. Such incidents can be reduced by power balancing and handling frequency. Being informed of the amount of energy that will be generated enables power balancing. This knowledge will enable power engineers to divert excess energy to storage mechanisms to prevent such accidents. This paper proposes and compares various machine learning and a neural network to forecast exported wind power. Five popular machine learning regressor algorithms and long-short term models are compared with focus on the output target variable.

This is because the climate is changing a lot and there aren't enough dams. Every year, floods cause a lot of damage to people, animals, and property. The first 72 hours after a disaster are the most important and life-threatening. This means that rescue efforts must start right away and move quickly. For these responses to work, the information needs to be correct and up-to-date, which can only happen with good communication and management between the victims and the different people involved in the response. Due to the collapse of physical infrastructures, old ways of communicating become useless and movement on the ground almost stops. Because there aren't any roads or other ways to get around, it's hard to do rescue work on the ground. Drones, on the other hand, can easily get to places where roads have been destroyed or stopped working. Drones with different skills should be part of the fleet helping with the rescue operation. This will make the efforts more successful. Most of the systems that were already out there in the literature had a central system for these drones. But as the number of tasks needed grows, the performance of the current system starts to get worse. This research is based on the idea that a smart method for relief operations done by multiple drones is more effective than a centralized method. In this proposed work, we have done a drone surveillance for the flood affected area by using Euclidean distances between the places to visit. The optimal path needs to be found out and, in this approach, we have made use of the Firefly Algorithm.

The news classifier can be the solution for problem, but the news classifications out there are usually based on the news content. The classifier will receive the word vector inputs that are taken from the news content and try to classify it into one of certain categories. Unfortunately, news contents can be longer and harder to be processed rather than processing the news headline. The news headline is shorter and packs a decent information for the classifier to find out what category it is. Besides the news headline usage, the classifier also needs to be chosen correctly. In this paper, the SVC model will be tested using the news headline data to classify the news and compare with several other models, such as Linear Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The common variables to be compared are the accuracy, recall, and precision to evaluate the SVC model.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063879","News Classification;News Category;Text Classification;TF-IDF;SVC","Training;Linear regression;Static VAr compensators;Data models;Telecommunications;Decision trees;Random forests","","","","","","9","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, early tumour detection is essential for arranging therapy as soon as possible. One of the most important factors in neurosurgery is the identification of brain tumour boundaries. Among the most serious reasons for death in humans is a brain tumour, which is an abnormal development of brain cells. A technique for detecting brain tumours can identify early-stage tumours. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) segmentation of brain tumours is the field's dominant research topic these days. Finding the precise dimensions and position of brain tumour monitoring is a very helpful procedure. These Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) techniques are now widely used in the automatic diagnosis of disease using MR imaging, mammography, and other sources. This gap can be addressed utilising the deep learning feature extraction technique and the innovative edge detection method, bringing accuracy noticeably closer to the manual results of a human evaluator as part of the goal of sustainable development through innovation. This paper provides the in-depth survey of the several techniques used by many researchers and concludes that the best strategy to identify the region of interest is Fuzzy C-Mean Algorithm among possible automated segmented techniques.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10064794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064794","Brain Tumour;Tumour Detection;Neurosurgery;MRI Image;Sustainable Development;Surgical Planning","","","","","","","32","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel method known as image inpainting has become a visionary tool for researchers in the field of image processing as digital picture editing has become more adaptable and image processing tools have improved. To understand how this method has become invaluable especially in the field of computer vision, we choose a deep learning technique that accepts multiple damaged photos as input undergoes training to construct a model to recognize missing information. We then validate the performance of the model to identify how well it can restore an image using multiple performance metrics.

Consequently, the LTE 900 MHz users suffer from inter-cell interferences (ICI) more than user in other bands. This paper presents a performance comparison of three different frequency reuse schemes for mitigating ICI, namely Strict Fractional Frequency Reuse (strict FFR), Soft Fractional Frequency Reuse (soft FFR), and Hard Frequency Reuse with reuse factor of 3. The performances evaluated using average user throughput and average Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) for users in the cell edge.

However multiple barriers are causing inequities in its formulation and delivery. Artificial intelligence based digital systems can analyze and optimize multi-disciplinary teams, treatment options, communication, prognostication, and patient outcomes, besides offering unprecedented speed, accuracy, and precision. While most of the research projects are focused on AI-based detection systems, it is important to understand the scope of AI in the life of these survivors post-diagnosis. This paper provides an understanding of the existing literature and the research efforts being made toward integrating AI in cancer survivorship care after diagnosis. Method: A literature search on the PubMed database in July 2022 using keywords ((""Artificial Intelligence""[All Fields] OR ""Artificial Intelligence""[MeSH Terms]) AND (""Cancer survivorship care""[All Fields] OR ""cancer survivor""[MeSH Terms])) revealed 33 articles published in English. Results: Through our review we could identify three themes: ‘What are the existing loopholes in cancer survivorship care’, ‘How is AI addressing them presently’ and ‘How can AI and ML address these barriers in cancer survivorship care in the future’. We also found many loopholes in AI-assisted digital systems such as transferability, explicability, reliability, validity, data confidentiality, ownership and responsibility, noise and overdiagnosis, resources for training etc. Conclusion: In accordance with Darwin’s ""survival of the fittest"", AI-empowered clinicians, not AI will replace the traditional ones who refuse to be empowered. Recognition of the research results and the imminent need to advance will create a more equitable survivorship care delivery in the future.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10065173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10065173","Artificial Intelligence;Cancer survivorship;machine learning","","","","","","","50","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most popular map reduce programming model is the open-source Hadoop. It executes the MapReduce (MR) programming model to process big data with MR jobs. Nevertheless, scheduling MR jobs across multiple nodes has been regarded as an optimization issue in spite of current endeavors toward ameliorating MR's performance. Hence, to carry out an MR Job scheduling centered on Completion Time (CT) and cost whilst meeting the security constraints, a new optimization algorithm like Decreasing Inertia Weight induced Whale Optimization Algorithm (DIW-WOA) is proposed. At first, for big data clustering, a Butterfly Optimization-centered K-Means clustering Algorithm (BO-KMA) is applied. At last, for scheduling the client's tasks or jobs to the optimized scheduler. The whale optimization algorithm is hybridized with inertia weight concept and finally DIW-WOA is employed. When weighed against the other well-known algorithms, the experimental outcomes exhibit that the proposed algorithms for data clustering, DS and Task Scheduling (TS) achieve better performance in terms of make-span and throughput.

The prevalent practice of valuation of residential property (which is calculated on Hedonic pricing model) is majorly driven by the external characteristics (such as location, land value, etc.). This is being promoted on the pretext that the internal characteristics of an apartments remains more or less same differing only on the limited aspects of area, no. of rooms, material specifications, etc. The design, on the other hand, plays tremendous role in improving quality of living. Restricting its valuation only to few features of provisioning does not allow us to appreciate the true value design has to offer. Building on this, this paper shows that by giving due importance to the design value of an apartment from its utility perspective, a more appropriate model of property valuation can be ascertained.This paper takes bedroom (as a case study) and applies fuzzy logic to predict the utility score of the bedroom. The inventory that the bedroom layout supports, the quality aspects associated with the bedroom inventory and the area becoming the inputs; the proposed system assigns a value to the bedroom from its utility perspective based on twenty-seven rules.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10064905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064905","Hedonic Pricing;Design Value;Utility Score;Fuzzy Logic;Apartment Layout","","","","","","","25","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So, for this a smart medicine box can be used. The smart medicine box proposed will have a knob through which either the patient or the guardian can set the time and then at the corresponding time an alarm would sound by means of a buzzer, the drawers will also open with the push of a button and an SMS will be sent which is convenient in situation where the guardian happens to be in an area where their internet fails to work or they happen to switch it off during their work. By pressing the button, the box opens sideways so patients can take their medication and after a minute it goes back in. This box is small, compact, and cheap and is suited for outdoor purposes as in the case of an app Wi-Fi would be needed to update the time whereas here it is not the case.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10059602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059602","Medicine box;SMS;visual indication;LCD;Menu;rotatory encoder","Schedules;Microcontrollers;Switches;Pressing;Containers;Sensor systems;Sensors","","","","","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inspection process plays a big role to produce good quality contact lens products. However, there is a challenge to detecting the defects in contact lenses during the production line. The transparent type of silicone hydrogel contact lens is one of the most difficult to detect the defects inside it. The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the differences in quality images between four different data acquisition approaches based on two image enhancement techniques, Gaussian blurring and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Acquiring a clear and good-quality image, required a specific experimental setup which consists of a high-resolution camera lens and also the right position of the camera stand and camera angle. Based on performance metrics for both enhancement techniques, Approach 2 showed better performance compared to other approaches when the result from Gaussian blurring showed the highest value of PSNR (29.02321), lowest values of MSE (81.42533), and lowest value AMBE (-0.55510). While for the CLAHE method, the result showed the highest value of PSNR (28.50377), the lowest value of MSE (91.77044), and the lowest value of AMBE (-0.05532). This proves that approach 2 provides a better quality image due to less noise.","","978-1-6654-9902-6","10.1109/AIST55798.2022.10065211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10065211","contact lens;defects;bubble;image processing;Gaussian blur;CLAHE","","","","","","","36","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Location goods usually always change or reposition to rearrange space in warehouses. Changes in the goods placement system have resulted in the location of goods being stored in the database. Retrieval of goods from the location requires an AGV (Automatic Guided Vehicle) which can work automatically based on data on the position of goods in the database. AGVs in warehouses use a lot of lanes on the warehouse floor as road guides. A search robot in the form of a car is developed by using data on the position of goods in the database as the direction of the robot's destination. The robot has Wi-Fi communication and uses RFID as a guide for the robot's path. RFID can be placed at certain points where the AGV needs direction assistance so that the robot does not rely on black lines. The movement of the robot is calculated through the actual position data from the RFID tag which is read when the robot passes the RFID and the position data of the item that has been given. The use of robots with the ability to detect their actual position is in accordance with the principles of a warehouse management system that requires automation and real-time data.

In Malaysia, cardiovascular diseases represents one fifth of total deaths in the country in the past three decades. Currently patients need some sort of drugs that help them to stabilize and restore the regular patterns of their heart beat because if the patients cannot manage to restore the normal heart beat pattern, the undesired heart condition could lead life threatening situations. Advancement of biotechnology has enabled the creation of new medicated drugs to provide better treatment options. However, when this treatment option fails and there is a need to provide emergency intervention to the patients in hospitals, the medical experts often need to know about the patients’ intake of any medications prior to hospital admittance for providing suitable treatments. Sometimes, this would be a difficult task as the patient might be admitted in semi-conscious or unconscious state. Therefore, this study focusses on identification of different medicated drugs usage through analysis of ECG data of the users. The data for the experiment was obtained from physionet library, which provides ECG data of subjects administered with a combination of Dofetilide, Mexiletine, lidocaine, Moxifloxacin and Diltiazem medicated drugs.

This ineffective screening can lead to delays in specialists’ expertise and subsequent treatment. Other causes of delayed diagnoses are the lack of awareness of oral cancer in the public and the lack of access to health care services at the right time. More causes in delay of oral cancer may be lack of knowledge in performing biopsies or similar forms of diagnostic tests, no access to oral cancer treatment/referral centers, and lack of trained professionals who can diagnose and treat oral cancers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be integrated in the dental field, as proven by DentalXrai-Pro and Yomi (7). AI-machines help guide the dentists by uncovering oral cancers and diagnosing them in less time. This use can lead to immense growth in the dental field as patients are satisfied, costs are reduced, and the results of dental clinics improve. These various methods of detection like semantic segmentation, object detection, and image classification can help start the increased use of AI in the dental field.

Manual DR diagnosis is a tedious and complex task; thus, an automated approach is needed to cater to the need of people across the world. A lot of automated approaches have been developed in the recent past for DR classification. Most of these approaches are computationally expensive and involve a lot of pre-processing techniques or transfer learning-based algorithms. The present work focuses on developing a computationally-effective approach with high performance for DR classification. The present work proposes a novel lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based DR binary classification model using shortcut connections to reuse the features of previous convolution layers. The proposed model is computationally effective and requires 1.137M (Million) parameters, which is much less than the existing approaches. The experimental study is executed on the APTOS dataset. The parametric evaluation of the proposed model is also analysed with several transfer learning-based approaches. The model obtained 0.9754 (classification accuracy and sensitivity), 0.9666 (specificity), 0.9755 (precision), 0.9747 (F-1 score), 0.97 (AUC), and 0.9509 (kappa score) with APTOS.

Images of dim scenes normally experience low contrast which corrupts the perceivability of the scene. Because of light scattering and absorption by climatic particles, pictures/recordings acquired from video surveillance, traffic checking, galactic imaging, clinical imaging, and remote detecting have poor perceivability. Noise and haze both degraded the overall quality of an image. So, the objective of this paper is to give a review with respect to these issues by reviewing over eleven techniques of image dehazing on different datasets.

One of the activities to fulfill those needs is to carry out sales and purchase transaction. The development of knowledge and technology makes the process of sales and purchase transaction become easier. Currently, sales and purchase transaction can be carried out online. However, there are many concerns that occur in online transaction, especially during the current pandemic, in which virus can be carried on the purchased items. One of the efforts to reduce the spread of the virus is to carry out disinfection sterilization. Prototype sorting items for disinfection sterilization is one of ways to carry out automatic sterilization. This system uses a smart relay as its main component, and uses ladder diagram programming as instruction. The smart relay used is zelio with 10 I/O. It has an input in the form of a photoelectric sensor that will be directly if there is object in front of it. And also, the addition of a water level sensor is to measure whether the disinfection liquid is ready to use. The output of the smart relay is in the form of a sprayer to spray disinfection liquid, and a dc motor to move object automatically. The dc motor and sprayer become the important points in the disinfection sterilization process. The speed of the dc motor used is 114 RPM with a voltage of 4.4VDC, so that with this speed, the object can reach the sprayer point within 3.5s for high object and 8s for short object. The use of a splitter is to direct short type object using a timer as a determinant of the degree of rotation. The degree of rotation produced must be 45o forward and backward rotation, and the timer used to obtain those degrees is 0.05s for the forward splitter servo motor and 0.1s for the opposite direction until it returns to its initial place.","","978-1-6654-5594-7","10.1109/TSSA56819.2022.10063895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063895","Sorting;Sterilization;Disinfection;Smart Relay","Liquids;Prototypes;Spraying;DC motors;Telecommunications;Relays;Servomotors","","","","","","8","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to India today, the police have said that 3,06,389 crime cases were reported in 2021 alone. To reduce the crime rate, faster action and stricter law policies are required. Due to the increasing crime rate, it becomes a very difficult task for the police to catch the criminals and address the issue quickly. One strong piece of evidence that helps the Police identify criminals is the CCTV footage. Unfortunately, the images in CCTV footage are generally blurred. Also, when criminals disguise themselves and commit a crime, it becomes even more difficult in identifying their faces. Hence, more time is required to resolve cases. To solve this problem, a tool was developed for disguised detection of images using machine learning algorithms. This tool includes age and gender detection of disguised images, an image search engine that can retrieve similar images, and the calculation of percentage similarity between the images. In our paper testing is performed using various algorithms like CNN, KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression and Decision tree [1]. Apart from this, a dataset is also generated with real time images, and further applied various noises, blurred images, and tested the model.

With the emergence of the “smart city” movement, automated vehicles have become a hot issue. Authorities and administrators are unprepared to deal with the anticipated disruption of autonomous vehicles, which might potentially replace traditional transportation. We don't yet know how new capabilities will disrupt existing systems and what policy solutions will be necessary to counteract this disruption. Autonomous vehicles have a variety of advantages and disadvantages that must be considered. One such challenge is its path planning. Autonomous vehicle path planning in dynamic situations is a critical yet difficult issue because of the limitations imposed by vehicle dynamics and the presence of other vehicles. Vehicle trajectories include a variety of operations, including lane holding, lane shift, ramp merging, and crossing the street at an intersection. In order to operate autonomously, a mobile platform must perform a variety of tasks such as localization and mapping, as well as motion control and path planning. We 'II look at a bunch of different ways path planning may be put to use in farming in this post.

This work focuses mainly about the autonomous drones and UAVs. Only for military objectives were Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) invented and developed. They have lately increased in use, nevertheless, in the civil applications this study shall examine. This technology has a wide range of applications, including in agriculture, environmental protection, public safety, and traffic flow management. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in smart cities is another promising new use for this technology. By 2050, the world's population is expected to have doubled. As a result, towns and communities face new difficulties and possibilities as a result of these expectations. For any smart city design, efficiency and cost-effectiveness are the primary objectives. After the global economic downturn, people's curiosity for smart cities has grown exponentially. Unmanned aerial vehicles' (UAVs') to discover the optimal route between a source and a destination, vehicle routing is a crucial field for study. There are a number of crucial considerations to be made in order to address these challenges in vehicle routing for UAVs. UAVs must be able to see where they are in relation to the map or graph in order to make these judgments. Planned routes for unmanned aerial vehicles are not only designed to minimize the risk of collisions, but they are also designed to be as efficient as possible. To get at the end destination in the least amount of time feasible, solution for vehicle routing problems is essential. In this work, we provide a solution to the vehicle routing issue in the form of an algorithm. The use of Delaunay triangulation is done to achieve the shortest path for the intelligent systems from source to destination. The experimental findings demonstrate that the Lin-Kernighan technique performs better than alternative algorithms for addressing the vehicle routing issue.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060807","Intelligent Systems;Vehicle Routing Problem;Borukuva;Delaunay Triangulation;Lin-Kernighan;Nearest Neighbor","Target tracking;Smart cities;Trajectory planning;Vehicle routing;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Planning;Sensors","","","","","","27","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the significant threats to dairy farmers is cattle diseases. Suppose the diseases are not identified at the correct time later when the disease turns into a chronic stage. The treatment cost will be more, and further, the financial cost incurred to the farmer is irreversible as the cattle may not give the yield it was offering earlier, even after getting healed. The idea is to identify the cattle diseases in the early stage so that the farmer can take the treatment measures without any delay. IOAHT and anomaly detection algorithms have been used to identify cattle heat stress. Cattle heat stress is one of the major issues that farmers face in hot regions. Cattle heat stress results in reduced milk yield. Also, the calving rate is reduced due to heat stress, which may further lead to the Repeat breading syndrome.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060524","Heat stress;anomaly detection;IOAHT (Internet of animal health things)","Heating systems;Knowledge engineering;Costs;Cows;Real-time systems;Behavioral sciences;Internet","","","","","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cognitive radio (CR) technology can provide a huge portion of the spectrum to support a massive wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity. CR devices are capable of sensing the licensed spectrum, owned by the so-called primary radio (PR) networks, and opportunistically utilize the underutilized portion of the spectrum without impacting the PR performance. Several communication protocols have been presented to deal with the presence of PR users through performing continuous sensing and channel switching. However, channel-switching method introduces significant overhead and latency, which negatively impact the performance of IoT delay-critical applications. Therefore, it is very important to reduce the needed number of channel switching for each CR transmission. Non-persistent CSMA-based protocols are recognized as energy-efficient access mechanisms for CR-IoT networks. For delay-sensitive CR-enable IoT networks, it is important to characterize the delay performance of the adopted protocols. In this paper, we analyse the delay performance of a multi-channel non-persistent CSMA protocol. Specifically, we provide closed-form expressions for the packet loss probability, success probability and transmission delay. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the network performance versus the various network parameters.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062886","","Performance evaluation;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Closed-form solutions;Packet loss;Switches;Software","","","","","","19","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stroke is considered a health-related crisis circumstance and can cause long-term neurological damage, complication, and often death. Most of the stroke is classified as ischemic and haemorrhagic. Stroke has been observed to have abnormal ECG signals. Therefore, if the individuals have their bio-signals monitored in real-time, they can get proper treatment rapidly. Most stroke diagnosis forecast systems are based on image processing tools namely CT and MRI, which are costly and hard to use in clinical practices. Stroke is the consequent driving cause for death around the world and quite possibly the most dangerous infection for persons over the age of 65. It causes ill-effects to the cerebrum like “coronary failure” which causes ill-effects to the heart. When a stroke sickness occurs, it causes enormous clinical care and permanent disability, yet in some cases, it also results in death. Like clockwork, someone dies of a stroke every 4 minutes, yet up to 80% of stroke could be averted if the medical specialist could forecast the incidence of stroke in initial phases. In this project, we have designed an ML model for predicting stroke utilizing the KNN algorithm, SVM algorithm, and NB algorithm. Followed by comparing KNN, SVM, and NB algorithms utilizing error and accuracy. Among KNN, SVM, and NB algorithms, the Support Vector Machine algorithm has the highest accuracy of 96.66%.

We are employing an ensemble learning technique and building an adaptive approach for performing bug prediction by dynamically selecting one classifier from a set of machine learning classifiers, that predicts if a class is bug prone or not based on characteristics of static software metrics captured for class. We are proposing a new Adaptive Approach for Bug Prediction using Dynamically Classifier Selection (ADCS) which dynamically selects the best base learning that better predicts bug-proneness of a class based on characteristics of the class.

Transitional metal oxide become of the most popular material as additive compound to dope in YSZ. It served as a good sintering aid which greatly benefit on cost and energy saving. Besides that, the addition compound for the objectives of improving mechanical properties especially of hardness and fracture toughness. Through the review of YSZ application in bio-material industry, it showed that 3mol% yttria stabilizer to TZP (3Y-TZP) received a great welcoming and exhibited attractive mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However, to further improve the mechanical properties to widen the application of 3Y-TZP is always the the researchers is looking into. Numerous studies have demonstrated and documented how doping Y-TZP with transition metal oxides will improve and support the mechanical properties. Besides oxide elements as dopant, other non-oxide elements also played a role to enhance the mechanical properties of 3Y-TZP. However, these kinds of dopant displayed and exhibited slightly different outcome. Among all, alumina is one of the most popular be utilized to dope 3Y-TZP (or even other YSZ), and the outcome can be very interesting. Thus far, popular techniques of employing doping to 3Y-TZP generally can be divided into two types, one is single doping and co-doping. The aim of this section is to review the previous works and research on both techniques of their effect of transitional metal oxide as dopant to Y-TZP in term of sintering, densification, grain size development, mechanical properties, and other possible outcomes.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060072","sleep quality;linked colour temperature;lighting;circadian rhythm","Knowledge engineering;Industries;Additives;Sintering;Metals;Doping;Rhythm","","","","","","30","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the research on data storage security vulnerability mining method of power IoT based on Spark framework and RASP technology is carried out. This paper puts forward a vulnerability mining methodology, which can be used to mine more potential vulnerabilities in Oracle more universally. In this way, the anonymous block is passed in as a parameter, and it is processed with the caller's permission instead of the definer's permission. Therefore, the attacker can only run the injected anonymous block with his own low permission, and can't achieve the attack purpose. The research results show that the algorithm designed in this paper will not be affected by memory space, so the mining efficiency of big data local frequent itemsets mining algorithm designed in this paper based on Spark framework will be much higher than that of traditional Apriori algorithm and FP-Growth algorithm.

The wavelet transform approach then effectively restores all important aspects in all dimensions and dimensions by breaking the images down into the Low-Pass (LP) and High-Pass (HP) sub-bands. In order to efficiently capture smooth edges and textures, Different sides of the Convolutional Neuronal Network receive the HP sub-bands This is done through a process of Feature Recognition, Initial Segmentation, And Consistency Confirmation. Whereas the LP sub-bands are merged using local energy fusion, the energy information is recovered utilizing the averaging and selection mode.

We dissect a photograph of the skin in order to locate high-level characteristics and normalise the image. We first construct a segmented map of the image using a neural network-based segmentation model, after which we group the areas of aberrant skin and feed this data to a classification model. Using a separate neural network model, we categorise each cluster into various prevalent skin conditions. In comparison to other experiments, our segmentation model performs better and also gets a nearly perfect sensitivity score under challenging circumstances. Our classification model can classify numerous diseases in a single image and is more accurate than a baseline model trained without segmentation.

However, it comes with its own set of challenges of which high dropout is still a major one. Identifying at-risk learners at an early stage is pivotal to offering personalized attention that can potentially prevent them from dropping out from the online courses. This work proposes two methods to analyze students' progress in an online course and subsequently identify dropout prone students. The first method performs fusion of course activity features by concatenating previous weeks' features before training. The second method extracts course activity features from the start date of the courses to a current week instead of concatenating as the first method does. A set of machine learning models and an ensemble framework were trained and tested on these two types of feature sets. On evaluating the models, the benchmark dataset KDDCup15 has been used, where the first method yielded an F1-score 91% while the second method yielded a score 92%. It was observed that both feature fusion methods produce comparable results although we expected that the concatenation of the features over time would produce better results. We also found that using features over a longer duration of time can help in achieving better performance.

As a result of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), disasters can be better managed. An emphasis has been placed on disaster and hazard prediction studies as well as assessments of risk and susceptibility and the detection of disasters as well as the implementation of early warning systems and disaster monitoring. A number of current disaster management applications have also been examined. The findings are discussed, and suggestions for further research are offered. As computing power rises and data availability expands, new flood detection methods are being developed using machine learning. To better understand nonlinear systems and make flood forecasts, machine learning has become a go-to tool. Hydrologic and hydraulic models that explain physical processes can be used in flood forecasting in conventional ways to predict hazard factors. Although these models may be used to gain a better understanding of a system, they frequently need a large amount of computing and data resources. Methods based on machine learning have the potential to enhance accuracy while also decreasing calculation time and model creation costs. As a result of this study, we now have a better understanding of the current status of flood forecasting using machine learning algorithms. This paper proposes a machine learning model for SIFT extraction. Once the extraction is done comparative analysis is done with the SVM and Fine Tree classifiers to prove the efficiency of the proposed model.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060037","Flood;Disaster;SIFT features;Fine Tree;SVM;Machine Learning","Support vector machines;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Mathematical models","","","","","","24","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The adaptive learning platform based on OBE teaching mode is designed and formed in this context. The main purpose of this paper is to study the design of adaptive learning platform based on OBE teaching and learning from the perspective of cloud computing. This paper combines the “OBE” concept with various learning models that are currently popular. The platform can be used for teaching without the need for teachers to design teaching programs and change the way teachers teach and learn. The adaptive learning platform can dynamically adjust the learning program, content and resources according to the actual situation and learning of the students, and the students can exit the system interface at any time after completing their assigned learning tasks and continue learning after self-modification of the current learning content. This platform enables students to learn each knowledge area more independently by dynamically adjusting the management of classroom progress and course schedule through independent selection of learning content, adjustment of learning time and learning plan. At the same time, teachers can use the platform to provide personalized guidance and supervision, as well as comparative analysis and summary of learning results.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060398","cloud computing;OBE teaching;adaptive learning;learning platform design","Computers;Cloud computing;Adaptive learning;Adaptation models;Schedules;Computational modeling;Time measurement","","","","","","14","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The adoption and success of NFV are contingent on managing software costs and resources. It involves multiple conflicting objectives, such as energy, licenses, resource migration, and cost. That makes it harder to implement resources and cost management. Thus, to address this problem to some extent, this article first module the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of software cost of VNF based on three crucial costs License Cost (LC), Resources Cost (RC), and Energy Cost (EC). LC is associated with software rights granted (and consumed) to the user. RC depends on the use of resources. The usage of resources determines the energy consumption by the VNF, which helps to estimate the Energy Cost (EC). After modeling TCO, we minimize the TCO by using the VNF resources sharing and consolidation technique. Our evaluation results verify that considering RC, LC, and EC for VNF sharing minimizes the TCO with optimum resource utilization.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062936","License cost;Simultaneous Active Users;Software licensing;VNF;Software Cost;Softwarization","","","","","","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As many of China's renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal energy, are concentrated in its western and northern regions, the country's high electricity demand is concentrated in its central, eastern, and southern regions. Therefore, it is crucial to research the mechanism of cross-province and cross-regional clean energy consumption in order to encourage the consumption of clean energy in places rich in clean energy and to relieve environmental pressure in areas with high power demand. As the current consumption of clean energy is not very optimistic, and is itself very volatile, intermittent and random, which is not conducive to grid-connected transmission, to increase the use of new energy and accomplish the goal of minimizing abandoned wind, light and water, this paper proposes an optimisation algorithm model for cross-province and cross-region clean energy cooperation game based on the G-V source-load adaptation, mainly based on this problem. The primary approach is to find the best combination of power generation and consumption with the aim of maximizing the value of the comprehensive fitness gain. This is done by proposing the idea of source-load fitness of the power curve and load curve, combining the cooperative game approach, and taking into account the transmission channel and other constraints. Finally, the cross-provincial problem is solved.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060719","clean energy;adaptation degree;inter-provincial and inter-regional;source-load adaptation;cooperative game","Knowledge engineering;Adaptation models;Renewable energy sources;Green products;Games;Time factors;Optimization","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But for areas with weak winds and poor sustained wind power, the wind energy is wasted. Therefore, making full use of all kinds of intermittent weak wind energy is very important in some scenarios. Aiming at the intermittent weak wind generated by vehicle bypass flow on highway, this paper proposes a method of power generation from vertical axis wind turbine. Firstly, the key factors affecting wind turbine power are analyzed and the relationship between vehicle speed and wind speed is discussed in depth. Secondly, the simulation is used to optimize the optimal installation position of the vertical axis wind power generation system, which shows the feasibility of using vehicle bypass flow to generate power. Finally, a vertical axis wind power generation system prototype is designed, manufactured and tested in the field. The experimental results show that when the wind speed reaches 7m/s, the output power of vertical axis wind power generation system can reach 14.52W, which can basically meet the demand of small lighting equipment. In order to further study, the utilization of weak intermittent wind energy, this study has carried out a positive and beneficial exploration.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060186","renewable energy sources;vertical axis wind power generation system;vehicle bypass flow","Road transportation;Knowledge engineering;Renewable energy sources;Wind energy;Communication systems;Wind speed;Prototypes","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem of “idea drift” in stream data flows is one of the difficulties. Random walk is a common issue in data analytics where the statistical features of the characteristics and the categories they are intended for change with time, decreasing the accuracy of the trained model. There are numerous approaches that have been put out for bulk data mining. A new generation of data mining methods called stream mining updates the model in a single pass whenever fresh data is received. Because of its inherent adaptability, this one-pass mechanism may be properly capable than its predecessors of coping with idea drift in data streams. In this study, we assess a group of algorithms for mining the data streams using decision trees. The collection of rules which can be derived from the induced model is the benefit of decision tree learning. The predicate logics that represent the extracted rules can then be applied in a variety of decision-supporting applications. Even in the face of concept drift, the induced decision tree has to be precise and condensed. When dealing with concept-drift data, we evaluate how well three common incremental decision tree methods (random forest, isolation forest, and forest tree) perform. In the experiment, drift data from both synthetic and actual environments are employed. It is discovered that optimization method with big data technique i.e., MapReduce yields better outcomes.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060693","Big Data Applications;MapReduce;Data Drift Problem;Hadoop","Adaptation models;Optimization methods;Forestry;Big Data;Data models;Regulation;Data mining","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main purpose of ambient intelligence might be easily damaged by an attacker tampering with those kinds of data. Hence, it is significant to secure the data. In the existing intrusion detection techniques, due to single-time authentication, the robustness level is low; thus, if any high-level attack occurs, there is a chance of skipping them. So, a novel R-Distributed Auto-Encoder (RDAE)-based Pseudo Random number based Quantum Key Distribution (PSR-QKD) is employed for energy-efficient intrusion detection to overcome the limitations. Initially, the node initialization is done and the original ID is assigned to them. By employing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm, the clustering is performed. Then, by deploying Double Precision Integrated-Golden Tortoise Beetle Optimizer (DPI-GTBO), the cluster heads are selected. For acquiring the unique ID, the original ID of the CH is hashed by RIPE Message Digest (RIPEMD)-128. By using the PSR-QKD technique, key generation is performed in the server. The Base Station (BS) verifies the node based on trust value and shares the public key during a new node entry. By employing RDAE, the CH matches the public key with the server and performs attack detection. In the end, CH shares the private key with the non-malicious nodes. When analogized to the prevailing methodologies, the proposed method is found to be more efficient.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060298","IDS;cluster head selection;attack detection;Pseudo Random number based Quantum Key Distribution (PSR-QKD) and R-Distributed Auto-encoder (RDAE)","Knowledge engineering;Wireless sensor networks;Intrusion detection;Public key;Authentication;Energy efficiency;Robustness","","","","","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Elastic-net regularization process selects significant features from the dataset and adds certain performance measures for efficient scheduling by the KFD process.

A rule is a mathematical statement that describes a relationship between two variables (in our case, different parts of a program). When a variable changes its value, it may trigger another variable to change; In other words, each event involves some causes and effects.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060118","Association rules;Terminal software;defect detection","Knowledge engineering;Computer science;Codes;Communication systems;Software","","","","","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Online monitoring technology cannot solve the problem of data mining in pet wearable devices, and the ability of data mining is poor. Therefore, this paper proposes a mining algorithm for pet wearable devices and constructs a data mining model for pet wearable devices. Firstly, the big data theory is used to classify the data of pet wearable devices, and the data is divided according to the device type to which the data belongs, so as to reduce the complexity of the data in pet wearable devices. Then, the big data theory classifies pet wearable devices, forms the data domain of pet wearable devices, and comprehensively analyzes the data. MATLAB simulation results show that data mining technology is superior to online monitoring technology in accuracy, stability and calculation time under a certain amount of pet wearable equipment data. Under the condition of clear data processing standards, data mining technology can comprehensively analyze pet wearable devices and meet the data mining requirements of pet wearable devices.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10059748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059748","on-line monitoring technology;pet wearable equipment;excavation;big data","Wearable computers;Simulation;Stability criteria;Big Data;Mathematical models;Data mining;Biomedical monitoring","","","","","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From an application perspective, the study of task scheduling mechanisms for data transfer in large cloud computing environments needs to be performed better. Unbalanced scheduling leads to traffic load, energy loss, and hardware control failure. In addition, residents' devices are not considered to reduce power consumption delay. So, the Internet of things (IoT) rules the modern trends of the Internet. The enormous number of things (objects), which are associated with the Internet, produces a large amount of information that needs a ton of exertion and task preparation to make it valuable. To resolve this problem, we propose a dynamic multi-level task scheduling (DMLTS) based on cascade shrink priority (CSP) to allocate the task to optimize the scheduling. With intent, a Tactical Load Balancer (TLB) and The Preemptive Flow Manager (PFM) are responsible for applying a load balancing strategy based on the mixed load balancing algorithm to improve the task allocation better to balance the load to improve the response time. Experimental results have been demonstrated concerning better load balancing, lower power rate, and time consumption rate in both phase and random uniform propagation.

The objective is to minimize the number of columns used to depict this axis. Machine learning (ML) is a data-driven technique in which computers learn without human intervention by analyzing large amounts of historical data. Incredible uses of ML may be found in a variety of fields. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are the three primary learning challenges in ML. The authors of this work provide a thorough comparison of several approaches to Dimensionality Reduction. Training a model using an unlabeled dataset is known as unsupervised learning. The model picks up knowledge independently by studying the characteristics of the training dataset. The model then uses these learned characteristics to draw inferences about the test data. Clustering, k- means, agglomerative, principal component analysis, and Fuzzy C-means are just few of the many unsupervised learning methodologies and algorithms available. When using support vector machines with a radial basis function kernel for disease diagnosis based on gene or protein expression data, we present empirical comparison results comparing PCA to other dimension reduction (DR) methods (i.e. K-means Clustering Algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Agglomerative, Apriori Algorithm, Fuzzy C-means). Among all this algorithms PCA gives the best results for the gene and protein dataset in terms of accuracy, cross validation rates and computing time. Our research shows that principle component analysis (PCA) not only outperforms other DR methods in terms of classification accuracy, but is also significantly more efficient since it does not need the optimization of a tuning parameter. The results lead us to believe that principal component analysis (PCA) might be a useful DR method for developing a trustworthy and unbiased classifier for gene or protein expression data.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060625","Unsupervised Learning;Literature Review Survey;Machine Learning;Unsupervised Learning Approaches Clustering;PCA","Proteins;Dimensionality reduction;Training;Support vector machines;Clustering algorithms;Classification algorithms;Unsupervised learning","","","","","","25","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most used consensus protocols is the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance which tolerates byzantine nodes and works upon asynchronous systems. However, it is not scalable enough because of the increasing number of messages exchanged through the network. Our proposition uses reinforcement learning to adjust the number of participating nodes depending on their behavior and on the actual network state. The number of participating nodes is reduced without affecting the protocol's safety and liveness. Only honest and rapid nodes are included in the consensus set.

In the process of combining big data, cloud computing and other information technologies with deep neural network(DNN), the financial shared service model(FSSM) has emerged, and this model has largely contributed to the upgrade and change of the traditional accounting industry. The FSSM has not only centralized the accounting work of enterprises, but also the related risks. This paper analyzes the human resource and cost effects of the implementation of the FSSM of Group S. By reflecting the business situation of Group S more quickly, accurately and timely, we find that the implementation of the FSSM can save labor costs and improve financial management.

The proposed research work thus focuses on the application of renewable energy sources, particularly making use of the wind, solar and piezoelectric sources for generating electricity, combined with the implementation of an IoT -based public-safety alarm system. Solar panels, wind turbines and piezoelectric sensors were installed to make a model for highway applications, which is followed by the installation of a smart alarm facility that uses internet services to send signals to connected devices. In keeping with the objective, evaluation of the energy spent in the case of the newly installed renewable sources indicated a significant decrease in the consumption of energy and power, as compared to previously established systems. The testing and use of an Internet of things (IoT) based alarm facility demonstrated that safety authorities can now be notified much more quickly and directly, with the push of a button.

Based on the feedback information of users evaluating project documents, ID3 algorithm, CLCC algorithm and SVM classification function are used to learn the potential intention and target of users' query respectively, and the learned rule knowledge or classification function is applied to support the project document query. The experimental computations and analysis are conducted for the query of project documents in a fund review management as an example. The results show that the number of project documents read and evaluated by the user in each interactive query loop is no more than 5% of the total number of documents returned from the previous query or 20 items, and together with the project documents already read and evaluated, they constitute the set of machine learning samples. The maximum number of interactive query cycle is set to 5. Among the three machine learning methods, ID3 also shows good prediction performance when post-processing algorithm is used. ID3 generates a decision tree with large width and small height. CLCC algorithm is better than ID3 algorithm, mainly because the rule post-processing of CLCC is more flexible, and the generated concept rules contain more merge rules and each merge rule is shorter. The SVM method has the best prediction performance, mainly because the project document keyword vectors are all continuous real values. It is concluded that the fund project intelligent interactive information retrieval process and processing flow accurately describes the potential query intention and target of user evaluation project documents, and establishes a user query project document classification learning knowledge base system, thus realizing the knowledge-based project document query support.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060452","fund review management;machine learning;intelligent interactive retrieval;project document retrieval","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Query processing;Knowledge based systems;Machine learning;Prediction algorithms;Libraries","","","","","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It could be semi-structured, unstructured, or even structured, making data analysis difficult. New architecture, methodologies, algorithms, and analytics are needed to extract hidden data and identify assaults on enormous amounts of data. It is quite challenging to identify assaults using conventional methods. This study provides a thorough analysis of malware detection in several sectors using deep learning and provides an overview of deep learning data. In networked computers, there have been more attacks. To protect a network, a strong intrusion detection system (IDS) is necessary. Reviewing the literature reveals that while some research has been conducted in this area, a thorough and in-depth investigation has not yet been carried out. For unanticipated and unpredictable assaults, many academics suggested an IDS employing deep learning, but not for big data. The present research design is based on three ensemble methods, Randam Forest, Decision tree regression, and Gradient Boosting Tree, as well as a deep learning-based intrusion detection system for large datasets named RNN that runs for 1,000 epochs with a learning rate complexity and diversity [0.01-0.5]. It is employed in the creation of the hybrid, safe, and scalable, which is based on big data and deep learning methods. In comparison to using just one classifier, the suggested classifiers provide a more accurate classification.

A simple incremental law equation and formula are established to analyze and calculate the spatial expression of the system's resistance state parameters. Finally, the simulation results are verified, compared and the error correction values are derived. The test results show that the passive and semi-active MR damping control is superior to the rubber insulation in controlling the horizontal displacement of the insulation layer. Passive MR damper control is particularly effective in controlling insulator deformation, but it will lead to the acceleration increase of each layer of the structure. If the acceleration control effect of the structure meets the requirements, the deformation of the insulator may increase. The semi-active control of MR damper is less effective than passive control in controlling insulator deformation, but the control effect of structural acceleration is better than passive control, so the integrated control effect of semi-active control is better than passive control.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10059941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059941","instantaneous optimal control algorithm;magnetorheological damping;DOF isolation structure;numerical simulation","Damping;Vibrations;Deformation;Magnetomechanical effects;Simulation;Optimal control;Numerical simulation","","","","","","12","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cognitive Radio (CR) and SDR appear to be feasible solutions for enhancing spectrum utilization and optimizing frequency band use among users. Indeed, CR is a type of wireless communication in which wireless devices detect and alter transmission properties in response to environmental sensing. We propose, in this work, a novel joint fully distributed spectrum management and hybrid routing protocol to arrange spectrum sharing among cognitive radio users. In our protocol, secondary users can alternate between the reactive channel selection phase and the proactive channel selection phase based on previous usage information maintained in their database tables about their list of available channels. Specifically, channel availability and utilization are established by investigating Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) transmission effects (pass or collision) and fed into a database table for each secondary user (SU). A java-based simulator is used to test the performance of our protocol. Throughput is utilized as an evaluation metric. According to simulation findings, our protocol considerably reduces collisions between secondary users while accessing spectrum opportunities for the transmission process and achieves higher throughput than the prior relevant protocol, namely, probabilistic and deterministic path selection protocol in the cognitive radio network.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062891","Software defined radios;CRNs;CSMA/CA;Proactive channel selection","Wireless sensor networks;Databases;Throughput;Routing;Routing protocols;Software;Ad hoc networks","","","","","","21","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the combination of fuzzy clustering method and gray model hair preprocessing method is introduced. Then, the simulation experiment results of Matlab software prove that the average number of the intelligent analysis algorithm is slightly larger in terms of the average number of the multi-dimensional FCCI(FCCI) segmentation technique, indicating that the performance of the intelligent analysis algorithm has been improved, mainly because the algorithm uses the midpoint method to select the original initial clustering center in the early stage, The algorithm can effectively reduce the number of iterations in the iterative process, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. This also shows that the method can well suppress noise and improve the effect of edge region separation. Finally, an idea of combining color threshold to effectively extract image segmentation features is proposed, and to some extent, adding color threshold to the image provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for its further promotion.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10059660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059660","intelligent analysis algorithm;multi-dimensional fuzzy c-means;color image;segmentation technique","Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Shape;Software algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Software","","","","","","12","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, VAE have certain limitations. But it might be more useful to learn using feature space distributions, rather than the more direct input space distribution. In this work, maximum mean discrepancy based auto-encoders with generative adversarial networks (MMDAEGAN) model is proposed.

Coverage is the area where signals can be received. Interference means that two or more signals attempt to be received at the same time, so they cannot be received. The results of coverage and interference will vary depending on the location of the receiver, but in general, if there are no obstacles between the transmitter and the receiver, all areas within a certain radius (e.g. 30 miles) should have good coverage.

In this paper, STIRPAT model is adopted to make a quantitative analysis of the relationship between carbon emissions and industrial structure, energy consumption, regional industrialization level and other factors. A large number of relevant historical data are collected and regression analysis is carried out on the data. Through organizing and analyzing the data results, it is concluded that energy consumption and carbon emissions are positively correlated.

Therefore, a customized ResNet based Convolution Neural Network (cRN-CNN) with batch normalization is proposed in this manuscript for addressing the above mentioned issue. The proposed cRN-CNN method has the advantage of faster training and computationally effective for the classification of BIRADS atlas based MRI breast cancer records, where the proposed model's performance is superior compared to the conventional CNN model.

In this paper, a laboratory test system for multi-relay magnetic resonance coupled insulator and current transformer is proposed and its design consideration and detailed method are given. Firstly, a test system structure that can simultaneously provide high voltage and large current is proposed to simulate the actual transmission line environment, while the extracted power is transferred wirelessly to the high voltage terminal of tested insulator to avoid the insulation problem. Then the compensation topology of wireless transfer module is determined, and the compensation parameter is properly configured. Finally, the magnetic coupler and its arrangement are designed according to the insulation distance and the limit of no influence on test results. The effect of wireless power transfer is also verified by finite element analysis (FEA). The results of finite element simulation show that the proposed compensation parameter can ensure the constant current(CC) output characteristic with gain of 1, and the magnetic coupler design meet the requirements of insulation and decoupling.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060360","R&D project of State Grid Corporation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060360","Insulator;wireless power transfer(WPT);compensation topology;compensation parameter;finite element analysis (FEA)","Wireless communication;Power transmission lines;Current transformers;Magnetic resonance;Couplers;High-voltage techniques;Insulators","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Dijkstra algorithm can obtain the optimal choice of the shortest path in the area, and is suitable for solving the single-source shortest path problem in the loop network without negative weight. Due to the large number of traversed nodes, sometimes the algorithm is not efficient. This paper analyses the typical path planning algorithm, designs the data storage structure, and focuses on the process of Dijkstra algorithm.

It also aids in effective monitoring and treatment preparation. Traditional methods of delineating the image manually requires anatomical knowledge and is error-prone, cumbersome and expensive. Deep learning methods, especially V-shaped Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance on 2-Dimensional (2D) clinical image data. However, when it comes to 3D medical images, they suffer from anisotropy which is non-homogeneity in all directions. This paper shows that conventional convolution-based networks are insufficient to accurately segment this kind of data and proposes a ‘U-shaped’ transformer-based network, leveraging the self-attention mechanism to achieve better segmentation results. The proposed model outperforms baseline convolution-based models in 3D lung cancer segmentation.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10059627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059627","transformers;3D image segmentation;lung cancer","Deep learning;Performance evaluation;Image segmentation;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Lung cancer","","","","","","25","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proportion of available fertile land is at its lowest point. This is where the usage of hydroponics can be put to use to address majority of the current issues in agriculture, home gardening, and green city applications. Using nutrient solutions necessary for the growth of a particular plant directly, hydroponics is a method of growing plants without the use of soil. A hydroponic system offers a favorable environment for plant growth while significantly reducing the amount of water consumed. The plants grown hydroponically are not subject to soil-borne illnesses or pest attacks. All around the world, there are fewer locations with access to clean water and food. Hydroponics offers a solution to all of these issues. Agriculture's most likely future is hydroponics, which can be done effectively with the aid of IoT.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060221","Hydroponics;Internet of Things;Thingspeak;Blynk;ESP32;MatLab","Natural resources;Urban areas;Sociology;Hydroponics;Solar energy;Production;Water conservation","","","","","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a transformer fails, the insulating oil in the transformer will leak, and the substation will build an accident oil pool to collect and store the leaking insulating oil. The accident oil pool serves as the last “line of defense” for transformer insulation oil leakage, but in the daily operation of the substation, due to the low frequency of use, it is often ignored and cannot attract the attention of the relevant personnel. When the existing accident oil tank in the substation cannot meet the demand, four square accident oil tank improvement schemes are proposed. The excess time and maximum excess of the original design oil tank and the improved oil tank under different working conditions are compared and analyzed.

Conformer is a convolution-augmented Transformer that can use CNN to more effectively extract the local features from audio data and use the Transformer to capture the global features. In order for SED to model and identify different types of sounds, both global and local information must be considered. Therefore, this method can effectively model the various features of sound events. Furthermore, inspired by the BERT, which has been very successful in the field of natural language processing (NLP), the Conformer-based method incorporates a special token that is used to predict weak labels in the input sequence. This token can aggregate the information of the whole sequence. In addition, we use semi-supervised learning to further enhance our model, and explore the impact of different data augmentation techniques. We evaluated our Conformer based model using the DCASE2020 Task4 validation dataset and obtained 47.7% event-based macro F1 scores, which is significantly better than 34.8% of the baseline system.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060191","General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771173); Key Program of Tianjin Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20JCZDJC00400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060191","conformer;data augmentation;deep learning;semi-supervised learning;sound event detection","Knowledge engineering;Event detection;Communication systems;Semisupervised learning;Feature extraction;Transformers;Natural language processing","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rice is threatened by a number of illnesses. For precise disease prevention and control, it is critical to establish rapid and accurate identification of rice plant illnesses. Many rice explosion organization methods necessitate the expertise of experienced agriculturalists. Keeping a watch on the farm for signs and symptoms of contamination takes a lot of time and work. To detect rice plant illnesses, current techniques investigation use snap shots or non-photo hyper spectral statistics, which necessitate human strategies to obtain the snap photos or data for evaluation. Rice blast detection is based on a non-photograph IoT sensor-based IoT infrastructure for soil cultivation.

At the same time, they have put forward higher, stricter and more scientific requirements for the landscape index. Its main purpose is to simulate real scenes, and to model and analyze the simulation objects through virtual reality technology(VRT). Landscape index parallel planning based on VRT is an important research direction under the future development trend. This paper summarizes the existing achievements of various disciplines in the VR field through the analysis of related topics at home and abroad, and establishes a GPU parallel algorithm platform based on real data. The virtual model is used to combine the real scene with the virtual environment to reflect the visual simulation. Finally, according to the weight coefficient, the optimal planning scheme and the optimal design landscape index are calculated to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm. The test results show that the running time of the GPU parallel algorithm fluctuates up and down in 20 seconds, the running efficiency of the algorithm is as high as 90%, and the parallel capacity is about 3500k. This shows that the performance of the CPU parallel algorithm meets user requirements.","","978-1-6654-5637-1","10.1109/ICKECS56523.2022.10060160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060160","virtual reality;landscape index;GPU parallel algorithm;algorithm design","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Simulation;Graphics processing units;Virtual environments","","","","","","12","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On paper, it is simple to claim that drones' potential uses are endless, regardless of whether they are land-based, airborne, undersea, or aquatic. But creating these apps for real-world use is rather laborious. This have thus developed the concept of a Multi-Functional Drone with this purpose in mind. This drone's objective is to create several attachments that can be turned on and off at the same time. This allows a single drone to serve numerous roles.

The case made here is to understand the Pricing strategies better and not prove or disprove any hypothesis or theory but to Pricing in an integral aspect for brands and consumers. Pricing strategy is what differentiates one brand from another and influences or tempts a consumer to purchase a product of that specific brand specifically in the Indian Telecom sector. Also, what implications does price of a product have on a consumer's behaviour. Pricing Methods essentially is derived from three main factors: Demand, Cost and Competitive Pricing. There are two basic factors that determine these pricing strategies: Invoice based and Subscription based. Where the Subscription based factor deals with either Pre-Paid or Post-Paid subscriptions and Invoice based factor with the incoming or outgoing based separately.

Some vehicles have the ability to decide in real time whether to issue warnings to the human driver or to take control of the vehicle autonomously, however these judgments are often made with limited or missing information. That's why it's crucial that humans maintain some degree of command over the wheels. To further facilitate communication between the driver and the vehicle, the proposed system details the design and execution of a digital driving system for a semi-autonomous car. Within this interface, the driver and the in-car information systems communicate with one another in an interactive fashion via an intelligent information network, with the driver's input being crucial to the successful operation of the vehicle. PIC microcontrollers are used to create the system's controller block, which is accompanied by temperature and alcohol sensors as well as a controller area area network (CAN).

After decades of research in automatic speaker recognition, there have been several new algorithms and advances, however, there still remains a number of challenges largely due to inconsistencies in speaker's vocal tract over a period of time and health, changing ambience and variations in the performance of speech recording systems etc. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is an extensively used method in automatic speaker recognition systems. The triangular mel weighing function is a key component of the MFCC feature extraction technique. In this paper various existing modifications in the mel weighing function have been presented and sinc function based mel weighing function has been proposed. The traditional triangular weighing function based as well as Gaussian weighing function based MFCC technique have been evaluated on the TSP speech database. This database contains 11 male and 12 female speakers having utterance of varying lengths. A distortion measure between extracted features established on the least Euclidean distance was utilized for speaker recognition. The success rate of this speaker recognition investigation was estimated to be 92 % in case of traditional triangular mel weighing function and was found to be 96 % in case of Gaussian mel weighing function for the speech segments of 2 seconds.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060563","Automatic speaker recognition;Mel window design;Mel frequency cepstral coefficients;Gaussian weighing functions;Feature vectors","Limiting;Databases;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Frequency estimation;Speaker recognition;Recording","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If MI is not detected early and the patient is not treated, it can result in a cardiac arrest, which can lead to death. The most commonly used medical treatments include the use of drugs or the performance of surgeries, which can be very costly for patients because healthcare can be expensive. As a result, it is critical to diagnose myocardial infarction at the appropriate time. The availability of large medical datasets in recent years has opened up new avenues for early detection of this disease. Wearable devices that accurately measure ECG and have built-in machine learning models have the potential to save millions of lives. While the new technique produces impressive results, its accuracy is lower when compared to traditional machine learning techniques used for MI detection. In this paper, a few traditional machine learning classifiers like Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are used to improve efficiency over other conventional classifier models. When compared to other classifiers, the results presented in this paper confirmed that, despite having the shortest processing time, logistic regression has a low percentage of specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity. Similarly, Linear SVM has the same processing time as KNN, but KNN has a 3% higher accuracy, implying that the proposed model can be applied to clinical datasets and patients successfully testified.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10059692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059692","Myocardial Infarction;Electrocardiograph;Heart disease;Machine learning;KNN","Support vector machines;Performance evaluation;Sensitivity;Wearable computers;Surgery;Cardiac arrest;Myocardium","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the lack of appropriate centralized mechanisms like identity management mechanisms carries risks such as impersonation and unauthorized access. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized data aggregation framework by leveraging self-sovereign identity, an emerging identity model, to lift the trust assumptions in centralized models and eliminate identity-related risks. Our framework formulates the aggregation protocol regarding data persistence and acquisition aspects, considering security, efficiency, flexibility, and compatibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework via a use case study where we concretize and apply our framework in a decentralized neuroscience data aggregation scenario.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062918","data aggregation;self-sovereign identity;decentralized system;software engineering;data security","Data privacy;Protocols;Neuroscience;Distributed ledger;Data aggregation;Data models;Software","","","","","","26","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, these models tend to make unfair predictions for certain protected features. Previously published works revolve around solving these issues both individually and jointly. However, there has been little study on how the adversary can launch an attack that can control model fairness.

Like many great inventions, the mobile phone has greatly influenced our lives and many areas of it. Without this convenient communication it is difficult to say what the future will look like. The coverage area is divided into individual cells or cells, with base stations (BS) at their core. In each “cell” the subscriber receives the same services within the specified territorial boundaries. This means that when moving from one “cell” to another, the subscriber does not feel the territorial connection and can freely use communication services. It is very important to have continuity of connection when moving. In this paper the connection privacy and management model was proposed to enhance the communication services. This is ensured by the so-called handover, in which the connection established by the subscriber is taken up by neighboring cells in a relay race, and the subscriber continues to talk or dig into social networks. The entire network is divided into two subsystems are the base station subsystem and the switching subsystem. The phone, after turning on and for the rest of the time, monitors (listens for, scans for) the presence of a GSM signal from its base station.

It is also linked to the cloud, where an open-source application server supports digital storage functions. By establishing a connection to the database (DB) via its IP address, the measured variables are delivered to the base station (BS) from the cloud and stored there. Then, a cooperative sensing model that uses many observed information as input and one merged informational item or action to be performed as output is tried. As a result, numerous inputs, such as temperature and humidity, were combined and averaged to provide a tightly integrated result. Last, the system integrated an android mobile application which is used to facilitate user interaction and connect through IoT based system that is station or gateway and the internet. GPS is Used to track the remote cold storage and transport container live locations.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060418","IoT;sensors;climate changes;Arduino","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Cloud computing;Temperature;Humidity;Containers;Internet of Things","","","","","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper systematically reviews how networking research innovations have explicitly been carried out to improve telesurgery performance and summarizes future lines of research and innovation. We used networking (or networks) and telesurgery (or remote surgery) as our inclusion criteria, excluding non-computer networks such as healthcare networks. Our initial screening on IEEE, PubMed, and Scopus for networking research innovations aimed at telesurgery yielded 17,854 studies. We extracted data from 15 papers after the title, abstract, and full-text screening of the identified studies. A review of the 15 studies shows innovations in networking protocols, integration with connectivity providers, distributed systems, and adaptive approaches to enhance telesurgery. These innovative approaches optimize telesurgery applications across medical domains in research and practice. Recently, research has also focused on how telesurgery networks can be made more flexible through approaches such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). We also note the rise in networking research innovations in recent years compared to the past. Networking has undergone several innovations to enhance bandwidth while minimizing latency, latency variations (jitter), and data loss. Networking research innovations have been leveraged locally in many countries and between nations, facilitating specialist care in remote regions that lack healthcare access. We foresee that networking research innovations will continue to revolutionize telesurgery applications and reach in the future.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062924","Networking;Telesurgery;Telehealth","","","","","","","89","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is essential for various applications such as video distribution, group video conferencing, data dissemination, and disaster relief communications. For typical wireless networks, multicast is efficiently accomplished as any transmitter can access the predefined allocated channels. However, for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) routing, several difficulties appear related to the unique features of CRNs, such as network heterogeneity, primary users' (PUs) priority, and dynamic behavior. In this paper, we implement a probability of success (POS)-based multicast routing protocol for CRNs, which jointly considers the required transmission time and the average spectrum availability time of the PU channels. For multicast routing, network throughput is limited by the worst receiver in the receiving group, so our approach presents a solution for this problem. Our objective is to improve the overall probability of success for all destinations. This can be achieved by performing multicast in multiple session fashion using a single discontiguous frequency-division multiplexing (D-OFDM) radio that can simultaneously operate over various channels. Our protocol finds the appropriate groups for transmission in multiple sessions. Each session has a group of nodes receiving over a distinct channel. Our protocol aims at minimizing the number of needed sessions to perform the multicast transmissions. We verify through simulations the potential improvement achieved by our protocol compared to a reference single-session multicast protocol.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062896","","Wireless networks;Radio transmitters;Receivers;Routing;Throughput;Multicast protocols;Software","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Almost all industries use plastic extensively. In India, plastic waste is typically dumped in natural resources, which dramatically increases environmental pollution. Humans frequently segregate plastic by hand, which is a poor solution. The concepts of deep learning (DL) and the internet of things (IOT) are combined in the suggested approach. IOT is utilized to pick up discovered plastic objects while a deep learning approach is utilized to detect plastic objects. Real-time object detection is crucial for locating plastic trash. As a feature extractor, Mask R-CNN and Resnet 101 are employed. Goal detection model Mask R-CNN is combined with Resnet 101 residual network, which speeds up neural network training. Resnet 101 utilises the residual subsystem to help the model converge. Prediction confidence scores are used to set an appropriate benchmark to reduce false positives because plastic things have various levels of transparency. Robotic arms are used to collect plastic trash that has been detected. Three motors are used to power the robotic arm. Two DC motors move the mobile robot forward and backward, and a third DC motor with a gripper is used to pick up the plastic object. Arduino Uno R3 manages the robotic arm's motions. The outcomes of the tests demonstrate that the suggested approach satisfactorily tracked different kinds of plastic particles and picked them up with a robot. The success rate of detection ranges from 85% to 93%. Different kinds of risks may be found in the future and employed for commercial and societal purposes.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060862","Plastic;IoT;Deep Neural Network;Mask R-CNN;Resnet 101;Arduino Uno R3","Deep learning;Training;Tracking;Manipulators;DC motors;Feature extraction;Plastics","","","","","","38","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implementation of Dadda multipliers will create a structure which consumes minimal power and operates at faster rate than any other multipliers. The Dadda tree reduction methodology is used in the Dadda multiplier to process the partial product and to get the final product.

To deal this issue, compression of ECG signal is widely used along with adaptive algorithm for noise removal of the signal. In this paper, an efficient method of ECG signal compression using discrete wavelet transform and SPIHT Decoder is proposed. The Adaptive Filtering techniques are mostly used to resolve the problems in digital communications environment and in the area of biomedical engineering. Various adaptive filtering methods have been proposed for cancellation of spurious noise in Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In order to make compression of ECG signals in which mainly need to remove the noise interference, a new adaptive filtering technique using FNLMS algorithm was proposed to reduce mean square error to denoise the ECG signal. A novel and powerful ECG signal compression using Discrete Wavelet Transform based image compression technique called Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) is becoming a state-of-art algorithm for image compression due to high image quality and simple quantization algorithm. The proposed design was implemented in Xilinx platform and MATLAB tool.

It's crucial to read reviews before purchasing a product so that you're aware of the benefits and drawbacks of the items you want to use; for example, you may learn whether or not a certain cosmetic brand is of a usable quality by reading reviews of the product. In order to make an informed decision about a cosmetics purchase, shoppers should read reviews and testimonials from other customers who have tried the product in question. It's clear that people are becoming more wary of review sites due to the sheer volume of reviews available. The reviews stop being useful at some point. So that readers may locate reliable product comparisons quickly, the writers categorise using both positive and negative classifications. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Nave Bayes (NB) algorithms may both benefit from the adoption of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization, resulting in more accurate and optimum solutions to the review categorization issue. In a head-to-head comparison using this data set, an SVM algorithm achieves an accuracy of 89.20% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.973, whereas an SVM based on PSO achieves an accuracy of 94.60% and an AUC of 0.985. Testing the data using the NB algorithm yielded an accuracy of 88.50% and an AUC of 0.536; next, the accuracy was compared to that of the PSO-based NB method, which was 0.692.

These technologies allow for complex processing and storage, closer to where data is collected - right at the edge. While Cloud Computing has received tremendous attention from both academia and industry for connecting many devices to the internet, the ever-growing number of IoT and mobile devices has created the demand for lower network latency and processing capability closer to the users. Edge computing provides an opportunity for wearable devices to access more resources without violating the constraints on weight, size, and sensing capabilities. It involves placing computing resources closer to where data originates (i.e. heart rate monitor, pumps, step counter, or other sensors) - or at the “edge.” Furthermore, edge computing provides many required on-device processing capabilities, which can then help in protecting users' private data as raw personal data (such as images and videos) don't need to be shared remotely. These computing resources may be located in the devices themselves or in hyper-local, small-scale data centres. This talk will look at the potential of edge computing for multimodal sensing while protecting users' privacy and will showcase several examples from recent work at the Smart Sensing Lab in this area.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062869","","","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result of the exponential development of CPSs connected components, cyber-attacks against CPSs have exploded. Moreover, new critical CPS have high-security constraints that must be detected and predicted at an early stage of the communication process. Thus, it has become harder to detect these attacks. Machine learning is one of the most effective techniques for identifying and detecting CPS vulnerabilities. As a result of the heterogeneity of traffic and attacks, only one machine learning algorithm is unreliable. To provide a self-adaptive and scalable prediction/detection mechanism, we propose a framework called AAPF-CPS, which combines several machine learning algorithms with statistical tests. With multiple classification algorithms, AAPF-CPS analyzes CPS network logs simultaneously and in real-time. Friedman's test is also used to rank each classifier for each context in AAPF-CPS. Experimental results showed that AAPF-CPS could adapt ML algorithms based on traffic, allowing it to predict and detect potential attacks more efficiently.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062873","CPS;Cyber attacks;Prediction;IDSIIPS;Machine Learning;Statistical test","","","","","","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computers are becoming more and more widespread across a wide range of industries due to their numerous advantages, notably in the healthcare industry. Typically, it is essential to the interchange of health information. In light of the ongoing issues with password security, sending private medical information via the internet still raises serious privacy concerns. Whether or whether they have complete permission, patients are not forced to divulge any of their private or personal information. This article examines several noteworthy recent studies that address the problems of password security and data privacy for cloud-based health services. These compare the benefits and drawbacks of different physical access preservation techniques. The paper also proposes a combined authentication procedure based on RFDE models. Cloud security is usually greatly hampered by the necessity for information privacy in an effort to protect sensitive and non-sensitive data for decision-making and to solve the problem of information leakage. One of the most challenging parts of the transfer of personal health records (PHRs) to the cloud is the reuse and exchange of accurate, complete medical evidence. When PHRs are outsourced to third-party businesses, such as cloud services, they are often used as patient-centered, private ways of exchanging health information. Data about a particular PHR doctor is coded for protection before being sent to the cloud. However, there are still substantial barriers due to issues with security, things that can be improved, lawful consumer privacy portfolio management, efficiency, and regulation over sensitive and non-sensitive data kept in the cloud. The PHR file may be encrypted using the Rail Fence Data Encryption (RFDE) technique to provide strong confidentiality rules and enable PHR and modular connectivity control to perform at their very best. Unauthorized users are managed to stop from accessing information with the aid of the transposition cypher, also used by RFDE and known as “zigzag encryption.” The recommended technique generates the secret key while encrypting the PHR information. The recipient decrypts the PHR data using the private key. The algorithm works brilliantly in comparison to the prior strategy.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060226","PHR;CSP;RFDE;Encryption;Covid 19;Cloud system;Health Analysis and","Rails;Industries;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Medical services;Passwords;Software","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Steganography is also known as “stealth writing.” Steganography is not a suitable replacement for cryptography; nevertheless, it can be used in conjunction with cryptography to further strengthen the information hiding mechanism. Steganography is not a good replacement for cryptography. The cover media for a steganographic method can be anything that can be represented digitally, such as a text file, image, audio file, video file, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol packet, or any other entity. Steganography can be used to hide information in these and other formats. First, the Robust Multitier Spatial Domain Secured Color Image Steganography in Server Environment (MSS-SE) approach is created as part of an effort to lower the possibility of compromising confidential communications. MSS-SE steganography methods, rather than transmitting the original picture from the server, send a randomized mix of a cover image and a confused image from the same server. This is done in place of delivering the original image. A unique approach that is based on deep hierarchical spectral spatial feature fusion has been developed by us in order to improve the classification of HSIs (DHSSFF). The pooling method, which is considered by CNN to be one of the most important regularization procedures, has been the primary focus of our attention prior to the construction of the model.

Each music is chosen based on the user's current emotional state. Track selection and organisation are still necessary for many traditional music players today. For each mood, users must create and edit playlists, which takes time. Some music players have sophisticated features like playlists and lyrics. Based on the performer or genre, similar songs are suggested. There is still room for improvement in the area of automation with regard to music players.

With the help of the Internet of Things, smart environments may achieve their main objective of improving the quality of people's daily lives (IoT). In this context, “things” means any Internet-enabled device. IoT's total reliance on the Internet raises serious issues about security and privacy. Traditional methods of addressing security and privacy threats cannot be used with IoT devices because of their limited storage, processing capability, and dependence on external power sources. That's why it's crucial to develop a sophisticated IDS that can perform reliably in an IoT environment. Intruder detection systems (IDS) might be signature-based, anomaly-based, or hybrid. The delay introduced by IoT devices is particularly problematic for use in time-sensitive scenarios. To solve for this delay issue, edge computing was created. Machine learning is one approach that may be used to implement IDS.

The primary objective of this research is to create a system that can recognise human face masks and determine whether individuals are attempting to maintain social distance. Alterations to everyone's daily routines. In such stages, everyone must always keep their identity concealed. Because the massive number of populations has changed since the Outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, finding people who are not wearing veils is a challenge. The global spread of COVID-19 has altered society. Many of us are staying in our homes, avoiding contact with city dwellers, and adjusting our routines-such as when and where we go to work or school-in ways we never would have imagined. We need updated timetables as we transition away from outmoded procedures. What stands out the most is the widespread practise of hiding one's face behind a veil or other kind of covering whenever we enter a public building. Wearing a veil or covering one's face may provide some comfort while also preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. By preventing anybody, even the unwitting carriers, from spreading the virus, widespread usage of protective clothing has the potential to significantly reduce the rate of disease spread in a given area. Thus, the importance of the veil and its identification are made very plain. There has been a rise in the importance of face recognition frameworks, which are especially useful in hospitals and medical clinics where privacy of patients is a concern. They're also vital in places like airports, sports stadiums, warehouses, and other such crowded areas where heavy foot traffic necessitates strict security measures to ensure everyone's safety. The framework of face veil recognition can ensure our safety and the safety of those around us. This assignment may serve as a digitally administered test anywhere from a classroom to a hospital to a bank to an airport terminal. Through the use of photo processing and extensive learning, we are able to recognise human faces and separate them into two groups, those with and without head coverings. The assignment will let a person who is responsible for screening people to do so even if they are located at a remote location, while still being able to effectively screen and provide guidance. Open CV, Tensor Flow, and Keras are some of the Python libraries used. With Deep Learning, As part of their model preparation, these activities make use of Convolution Neural Networks, a subset of Deep Neural Networks.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060267","COVID-19 Pandemic;Face Mask Detection;Convolutional Neural Networks;Performance Evaluations","COVID-19;Deep learning;Hospitals;Face recognition;Neural networks;Urban areas;Airports","","","","","","41","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The importance of facial recognition has grown as a direct result of the rise in the number of fakes. The information that makes up the repository for newborn babies comes from a wide variety of sources, and it features babies in a variety of poses and lighting conditions throughout many distinct galleries. A number of different facial recognition strategies and classification algorithms currently used in commercial systems are also examined as part of a standard benchmark test. The data set is obtained from the face of a newborn baby, then trained and tested with classification algorithms, and then compared based on a variety of performance indicators. The extractable features from a picture serve as the basis for the classification process, and some of these extracted features are also used for the purposes of training and testing in conjunction with the classification process. Different feature extraction strategies are investigated in this study, including local binary patterns (LBP), principal component analysis (PCA), and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). LBPs are described by their local binary patterns. Eigenfaces and Eigenvectors are produced using Principal Component Analysis, and second-order statistical features are constructed with Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix. Photographs of newborn babies displaying a variety of facial expressions use these techniques. The extracted features are provided as input to the support vector machine for classification. In comparison to the other feature extraction methods, the principal component analysis method had an accuracy of 91%, a better recognition rate, and a shorter computation time.

This capability is used for multi-hop routing in wireless networks because it increases the end-to-end throughput compared to Half-duplex (HD) transmission capabilities. There are two types of FD capability, In-band FD (IB-FD) and Out-of-Band FD (OB-FD). The IB- FD allows the device to transmit and receive at the same channel, while in the OB-FD the device must transmit and receive over different channels. In this paper, for Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), we analyze the channel assignment condition that achieves the maximum capacity when the FD techniques (IB-FD and OB-FD) are used. Moreover, we compare their throughput with respect to the HD capability. In general, the IB-FD has a higher throughput than OB-FD. However, it needs higher hardware complexity and cost.

In such systems, the use of biometric data is challenging, namely in the centralized environment. It represents several risks, including information leakage, unreliability, security, privacy, etc. To tackle these issues, several approaches are proposed based on blockchain technology, which has recently gained popularity in various areas. Given the risks related to data security and many others to the technologies involved, it is essential today to have specific protection, particularly for authentication, access control, authorization, secure transfer, traceability, etc. To this end, this project aims to provide secure and intrusion-tolerant intelligent infrastructure and platform, combining the aforementioned technologies to assist and facilitate the daily and professional lives of human beings, respecting their privacy and guaranteeing the security of data and transactions. This research project aims more specifically at cybersecurity based on deep learning through the speech recognition system on the one hand. On the other hand, the ultimate goal is to detect anomalies in the behavior of users once accessing the system. The blockchain will be used to ensure the authentication and identification processes, to deploy the security policy with the smart contract, and also to take care of the generation of the keys necessary for the encryption. The authentication and identification process is done through a combination of voice recognition and user credentials (attributes), using deep learning to extract features and then comparing the template generated with those stored in the blockchain. In addition, our objective is to optimize the voice recognition algorithms. The optimization of such a system requires performance optimization of the platform (i.e., maximization) and risk reduction (i.e., minimization).","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062921","Biometrics;Blockchain;Speech recognition;Deep learning;Access control","Deep learning;Privacy;Biometrics (access control);Data security;Smart contracts;Authentication;Speech recognition","","","","","","6","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most basic need is a well-trained medical team that can keep track of patients' fluid and electrolyte levels and provide appropriate treatment. Patients in hospitals, particularly those in the critical care unit, rely on drips to regulate the amount of fluids and electrolytes entering their bloodstream around the clock, every day of the week. Patients' drips should be checked on or replaced often to prevent the spread of infection. Overcrowding and a likely scarcity of nurses, despite the system's apparent simplicity of use, may leave patients in risk, hastening the decline of their health or even causing death. Nurses or other medical staff often check the strength of a patient's drip. An alert observer may keep track of the time and remember to refill the bottle when it's needed. Due to the high volume of patients seeking treatment in hospitals during the outbreak, nurses were unable to keep tabs on each individual patient's drip status and infusion rate no matter how many extra hours they put in. Some patients died because the nurses ignored them. The next step in providing better healthcare at a more convenient and affordable price is to automate such vital activities.

The number of smartphones has increased dramatically offering many opportunities and yet, challenges. Recently, more attention has been paid for the energy consumed by smartphone applications due to its limited power source (i.e., batteries). Mobile operating systems apply optimizations to power management that are not common with traditional operating systems, and application developers need to consider energy optimization as an important requirement. The need to optimize power consumption has given rise to the development of tools to analyze and identify how and when power is used. In this paper, we present and compare various tools aimed at performing this type of analysis for Android applications.","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062919","","Energy consumption;Power demand;Operating systems;Power system management;Software;Batteries;Smart phones","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the privacy and security concerns in FL systems need to be further investigated to fully leverage the capabilities of this protocol, especially in industries involving highly sensitive data, such as healthcare.

A melanoma can be classified into benign and malignant. Fortunately, melanoma is completely curable if caught early. Melanoma, both benign and malignant, can present in a manner that is identical. As a result, distinguishing the two is quite challenging. The early identification of skin cancer presents a significant challenge. To determine which one is benign and which one is cancerous, you need the expertise of a board-certified dermatologist. Automated early detection systems for skin cancer are absolutely necessary for saving lives and reducing time and effort. This paper proposes an automatic skin lesion categorization system that uses a pretrained deep learning network and transfer learning. A detection system based on digital image processing was developed in order to make an early diagnosis of melanoma. In order to make the images of skin more appealing, dermoscopy images were first acquired, then preprocessed and postprocessed to remove noise. A modified k-means clustering algorithm is used to segment the processed image after k-means clustering. The attributes are then extracted using first-order statistics, gray-level co-occurrence matrices, and feature extraction techniques. Comparing the proposed method to the existing approaches, it was discovered that the classification rate of the suggested method exceeded the output of the existing approaches.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060456","Melanoma;Skin Cancer;K-Means;image enhancement","Image segmentation;Thresholding (Imaging);Transfer learning;Clustering algorithms;Melanoma;Feature extraction;Skin","","","","","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, software defined networking offers a cutting-edge framework for managing network resources that solves a number of problems with the management of network resources in CR Networks (CRNs). Moreover, researchers are becoming more and more interested in In-Band-Full-Duplex (IBFD) in CRNs. The combination of IBFD and CRNs improves the network's performance greatly because of the effective dynamic spectrum access. Hence, we offer an adaptive Full-Duplex (FD) CRNs routing protocol that utilize common control channel. Our protocol employs adaptive FD communication, where the secondary users change their communication mode in response to the primary users' activity on the spectrum. Further, communication modes used in our work are FD Transmit and Sense (FDTS), FD Transmit and Receive (FDTR), and Sensing Only (SO). A Java language simulator for IBFD-CRNs that had already been published in the literature was used to assess the performance of our protocol.

The goal of this study is to provide fresh, efficient methods for mining huge data patterns. To accomplish this, a variety of methods based on the Map reduction algorithm as well as the Apache expansive implementation have been proposed. The recommended algorithms may be divided into three main groups. The Attribute Mapper (AprioriMR) and recurrent AprioriMR techniques, which eliminate any previous objects in data without employing a pruning methodology, are the first two described. Second, two recommended approaches (space cutting AprioriMR or top AprioriMR) to improve the search space leverage certain well-generalized pro property. The last approach for mining compressed versions of frequent patterns is the maximum AprioriMR algorithm. To evaluate the efficacy of the offered strategies, up to 3 1018 interactions and more than 5 million distinct ones have been examined in a range of big data datasets. Evaluations of well-known and efficient pattern mining algorithms are part of the testing process.

For some of these uses, the network of several sensors is positioned underwater at various depths. These nodes need multi-hop transmission, which is made possible by efficient routing design, but the seafloor located IoT devices seem to be unable to connect without a hitch to any network that are near to the base level. The occurrence of uninhabited areas along the route may also have an impact on the overall efficacy of UWASNs. Therefore, the empty zone may be avoided by choosing the optimum introduction. The optimum routing node is chosen based on the strength of the connection, average energy, depth fluctuation, and length difference. An orientation is another factor that is taken into account while selecting the optimum forwarder node. Using the theory of the maned wolf optimization issue, the best course of action is determined. The suggested approach extends the life of the network and also balances network energy by avoiding the vacant zone.

It is necessary to carry out many administrative functions. They reveal the essence and content of management activities at any level. Management functions show what and how the object is doing in order to more accurately represent the object, goals are set, impact management is developed and implemented, and its implementation is monitored. Thus, the control function is understood as a special type of operation, which is a set of actions or decisions carried out in the management of the company. In this paper a smart machine learning model was proposed to manage the different management activities. The management functions are assigned to individual employees and each is responsible for the quality performance of his/her function. Activities are fixed by job descriptions. In addition to instructions, regulations are developed in departments that determine the department's position in the organization and establish the responsibility of each department for developing issues within the department's competence.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060425","management;administrative;functions;implementation;monitoring;goal;machine learning","Economics;Standards organizations;Production;Companies;Machine learning;Regulation;Planning","","","","","","31","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this case, messages are repeatedly encrypted and sent through multiple routers, each applying an encryption layer of its own. Thus, the intermediate points of communication have no information about the content or purpose of the message, nor about the sending point or the receiving point. In this paper a secured onion routing model was proposed to detect the anonymous web browsing in the high density cloud network. The main idea of the proposed onion routing model is to ensure maximum anonymity of users - the sender and receiver of information, as well as to protect the content of the message from strangers. Of course, onion routing technology does not guarantee secrecy, but it does make it more difficult for eavesdroppers to discover the data.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10059697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059697","onion routing;TOR browser;anonymous;exchange;information;internet","Privacy;Cloud computing;Web pages;Receivers;Search engines;Routing;Browsers","","","","","","39","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the foreign countries has been using E-vehicle in large number and because of the charging the electric vehicle at home increased the price of electricity bill. For example, the E-vehicle charges for more than 8-hours which rapidly increases the cost of electricity bill to $190 per month. In order to reduce the cost of electricity bill, the renewable energy can be used as the source of power to charge the electric vehicle. In this project we are using the renewable energy as the source of power to refuel an electric vehicle.

To achieve such a broad frequency range, the suggested antenna makes use of a new defective ground structure (DGS). For the antenna to work better, a triangular strip is added to the ground plane. In addition to improve the gain of the microstrip-antenna, the WMP A proposed uses the reflective plate to focus on the side lobes and reduce the creation of the main lobes. The suggested WMP A is designed and built on a FR-4 epoxy substrate, and the inset feed approach is utilised in order to provide the WMP A with its input. Utilizing the CST Microwave Studio Suite, the simulation of the proposed antenna and its subsequent optimization are carried out. The WMP A takes up a minimal amount of space on the substrate, yet it achieves excellent results in terms of gain, directivity, and radiation efficiency. The suggested antenna has a frequency range of 4.93 GHz to 5.765 GHz, which allows it to cover the sub-6 GHz portion of the 5G spectrum ranging from 4.9 GHz to 5.8 GHz. The computed and measured properties of the antenna demonstrate that the this high gain compact WMPA is suitable for the applications operating at frequencies below 6 GHz.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060179","5G sub 6 GHz band;patch antenna;wideband microstrip antenna","Microwave antennas;5G mobile communication;Patch antennas;Microstrip antennas;Frequency measurement;Microstrip;Broadband antennas","","","","","","25","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clumsy wiring on the prototype board also blinks. The voltage across the transistor rises to nearly the voltage of the power supply and then drops to zero. This suggests that the transistors in this circuit are operating in a key mode. A transistorized multivibrator is a square wave generator and an oscillogram of a symmetrical multiple vibrations. A symmetrical multivibrator generates rectangular pulses with two duty cycles. Read more about duty cycle in the article Frequency Generator. Let's use the working principle of symmetric multivibrator to drive LEDs. The values of the collector resistors are insignificant, but they affect the frequency of the multivibrator. This is complete nonsense! In the correct calculation of the multivibrator, the deviation of the values of these resistors from the calculated one by more than five times will not change the frequency of the multivibrator. The main thing is that their resistance should be lower than the base resistors because the collector resistors provide faster charging of the capacitors.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10059741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059741","symmetrical;multivibrator;rectangular pulse;Frequency;generator;key mode","Resistors;Wiring;Vibrations;Capacitors;Voltage;Multivibrators;Light emitting diodes","","","","","","27","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is transforming the way people transact from the comfort of home at a mouse click. More and more people preferring online shopping, is indeed a boon for ecommerce sites. However, cybercrime is also on an exponential rise, imposing a major threat. Credit card frauds, innovative phishing attacks, bad bots are a few challenges and there is a plethora of others resulting in not only loss in revenue but reputational damage to the e-commerce organization. Confidence in digital security has been essentially eroded due to major data leaks. Cyber Security is like air, vital for existence. The foundation pillars of cyber security are confidentiality which ensures that the customer's critical information like bank card details is safe, integrity which implies maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data throughout the ecommerce site surfing and transaction activity, and availability of requested data 24*7 on the website. Ecommerce industry needs to keep cyber security challenges at the center of all management decisions to ensure continuity, resilience and agility of the ongoing processes. The major area of concern is data privacy-security of customers' data. The paper discusses and analyses various types of cyber-attacks on leading ecommerce sites, and vulnerabilities frequently affecting the e-commerce web applications and suggests mitigation measures based on current industry standards.

If about ten years ago laptops were so rare among ordinary users that they had not even heard of tablets, today they are both common. The custom of being connected to the network by wires is stupid because all their movement is lost. Of course, if you move the laptop exclusively between the desktop and the sofa, you can still tolerate the presence of an extra cable, but if you use it throughout the apartment, carrying the cable with you is already inconvenient., and wiring a network to all rooms is somewhat expensive and impractical. Most users install Wi-Fi routers at home. First of all, it is very convenient, unless you like to get tangled up in wires and tied in one place. Secondly, buying mobile gadgets makes it necessary to have unlimited high-speed internet at home. Few people know how to set up a Wi-Fi router so that the connection is stable, powerful and fast. The router has two antennas - this allows you to significantly increase the range and stability of the signal.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060077","Wireless Sensor Networks;Intrusion Detection System;Deep Learning;IP based Packets Classification","Wireless communication;Wiring;Wireless sensor networks;Portable computers;Wires;Data transfer;Task analysis","","","","","","33","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This happens most often because the driver hasn't had enough sleep, but it may also be the consequence of untreated sleep disorders, substance abuse, or working odd hours. That's why it's crucial for cars to have systems in place to track and verify the identities of their drivers. Analyzing things like head orientation, eye movement, yawning, and ocular condition are crucial. This study suggests a mechanism for detecting driver fatigue by keeping track of the number of times the driver opens and closes their eyes and their lips. If the driver keeps his eyes closed for too long, an alarm will go off. In addition, if the driver is seen nodding off more than some few times, the vehicle's owner is contacted by e-mail to confirm that the driver is exercising precautions to prevent dozing off behind the wheel. The results of the system proposed in the paper on Deep learning technology of Dlib show that it is effective at detecting tiredness and thus decreasing the number of accidents that occur while driving. The system uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) as its base algorithm for accurate detection and is implemented in MATLAB environments with a camera mounted. The suggested technique achieved a 99% success rate for video clip input.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10059778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059778","Driver Drowsiness Detection;Deep Learning;Web Camera and Matlab Modules","Deep learning;Tracking;Sleep;Wheels;Cameras;Convolutional neural networks;Automobiles","","","","","","41","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has become the generally accepted standard for all countries, however, as an alternative, in the earlier days, the CDMA standard or Code Division Multiple Access (Code Division Multiple Access Technology) was proposed. If in GSM communications digital information packets are separated in time, then the CDMA standard uses not only time but coded separation. Voice packets are encrypted in one way, subscriber personal data packets are encrypted in another way, and the Internet connection uses a third way of encryption. All data can be sent simultaneously without interfering with each other. If the phone has not only GSM, but also CDMA, it means that you have a dual-standard phone that can work on networks with different signal coding principles. In fact, CDMA is a higher quality, higher speed and more reliable standard.

Unquestionably, side-channel attacks are one of the most severe risks to hardware security. Rather than depending on bugs in the program itself, a side-channel attack exploits information leaked from the program implementation in order to exfiltrate sensitive secret information such as cryptographic keys. A side channel assault could manifest in different ways including electromagnetic radiation, power consumption, timing data, or even acoustic emanation. Ever since the side-channel attacks were introduced in the 1990s, a number of significant attacks on cryptographic implementations utilizing side-channel analysis have emerged, such as template attacks, and attacks based on power analysis and electromagnetic analysis. However, Artificial Intelligence has become more prevalent. Attackers are now more interested in machine learning and deep learning technologies that enable them to interpret the extracted raw data.

The monitoring of environmental changes against fish eggs is required. This process is conducted manually, which results in the death of several fish eggs. Even though system automation is a good solution. The issue of poor reaction time still exists since fish breeders need them to interact more closely with the system to understand what's happening. This problem may be solved by keeping some essential factors, such as temperature at an ideal level for eggs to survive. The automated fish eggs incubator with smart cylinder is the subject of this study, which keeps track of many environmental changes such oxygen levels, mechanical damage, water temperatures, flow rates, and water quality. A network of sensors, including temperature sensors, PH sensors, and water flow sensors, is responsible for controlling each of these factors. The data relating to these factors is kept in the cloud for future study and analysis, and the concerned party can keep an eye on it remotely.

To accommodate the demand for generation, new power generation facilities are planned. There are plans to expand the distribution and transmission networks. Distributed generation (DG) is small-scale energy production that uses renewable resources and is connected directly to the distribution network. DGs are advantageous in that they are environmentally benign, require less time to construct, and do not require a complicated transmission and distribution network between generation and consumption. DGs will also affect the distribution system's voltage drop, stability, and power losses. In this study, a single 11 kV radial distribution feeder is simulated-analyzed to examine the effects of various DG technologies on the decrease of power loss. Due to their ability to inject reactive power, synchronous generators used for wind energy production result in the lowest possible power loss. Reactive power from the grid is needed for induction generators, which results in minimal power loss reduction. Only active power is generated by PV cells, which leads in a modest reduction in power losses.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10059896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059896","Distributed generation;wind and solar energy;Industrial System;Electrical Power","Reactive power;Wind energy;Induction generators;Production;Distribution networks;Voltage;Wind power generation","","","","","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The field of machine learning (ML) replicates various kinds of disaster detection by employing mathematical and physical models, as well as long-term and short-term disaster forecasts. The effectiveness of various strategies for detecting disaster is analyzed here. These models alleviate the danger, offer potential solutions, and avert injury and loss of life. The potential for hybridization and machine learning to improve forecasting appealed to climatologists.

Considering that over 40% of partners in infertile marriages have, it is connected to male infertility. Elevated scrotal temperature is thought to be the primary pathophysiological cause of poor spermastogenesis. Scrotal ultrasound/doppler and physical examination are the cornerstones for diagnosing varicocele. A extremely sensitive infrared camera is used in the diagnostic procedure known as thermography to assess temperature changes across the skin's surface. Regarding the diagnostic criteria for thermography in the diagnosis of varicocele, there is currently no agreement. The purpose of this study is to look at how digital thermography is used to diagnose varicocele. Materials and Techniques: 20 patients made up the study group, with ages ranging from 15.5 to 23.7 and a mean of 18.2 ± 2.4. Varicocele was unintentionally found in all cases during a routine medical examination. Three techniques were used to assess every patient. Physical examination, ultrasound/doppler, and infrared digital thermography were done in that order. All estimations were led utilizing an infrared camera, the Thermo Tracer TH7102WL from NEC Sanei Instruments, Ltd. in Japan. The insignificant distinguishable temperature goal (distinction) for this infrared framework is 0.07° C at 30°C, while the mathematical goal is 76.800 pixels per picture. Results: Right pampiniform plexus temperature was 32.53± 0.78°C and left pampiniform plexus temperature was 34.65 ± 0.66°C (territory: 34.1 to 36.3°C). Right gonad temperature was 32.19± 0.81°C and left gonad temperature was 33.58± 0.97°C (territory = 32.1-35°C). The essential thermographic side effect of varicocele is a pampiniform plexus temperature more prominent than 34°C, while a testicular temperature more prominent than 32°C is reminiscent of varicocele. The temperature distinction between the balls was 1.39°C, while the contrast between the left and right pampiniform plexus was 2.12°C (a scope of 0.9 to 4.7°C). All patients had their varicocele analyze effectively upheld by thermography. In conclusion, digital infrared thermography offers a practical and affordable varicocele diagnosis approach. It is important to do extra research on additional patients and solid workers to approve the strategy's awareness and explicitness and to make uniform analytic standards for the thermographic appraisal of varicocele.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060314","Varicocele;Scrotal temperature;Thermography;wavelet analysis;diagnosis and grading","Temperature sensors;Wavelet transforms;Ultrasonic imaging;Production;Cameras;Wavelet analysis;Solids","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The people group of digital forensics has been significantly influenced by the speedy advancement of digital devices, and digital crimes have gone with the same pattern. Right now many cases are being heard in courtrooms all over the planet where, despite their subject matter and starting place, there is digital evidence present. Traditional cases including the dealing of unlawful substances, homicides, misrepresentation, and many different offenses increasingly vigorously depend on information/information stored on a digital gadget. Thusly, digital forensics approaches are expected to assemble digital evidence in the two situations where a wrongdoing is finished using a digital gadget and situations where the wrongdoing was not completely carried out using a digital gadget. As the evidence got is intrinsically exceptional from different sorts of evidence got in traditional “forensic” investigations, digital forensics offer issues. The essential distinction is that digital evidence is more susceptible to duplication and control by investigators (or not), whether on purpose or accidentally. This article describes how digital forensic processes can be used to gather the digital evidence needed to convict or acquit individuals accused of such crimes, and some of the things that need to be addressed. describes the key challenges of An integrated framework and methodologies for investigations using digital evidence are presented, including legal, technical, ethical, and educational aspects of digital forensics. The purpose of these drafts is to provide solutions to problems related to the collection and subsequent presentation of digital evidence in court. We also provide guidelines for strengthening this type of evidence when presented in court.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060528","Digital forensic investigation models;data acquisition;operating system assisted profiling;Challenges Faced by forensics investigators;Evidence","Ethics;Technological innovation;Digital forensics;Writing;Regulation;Reliability;Computer crime","","","","","","22","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To the best of our knowledge, however, there is currently no accessible generic text removal method that can be used to any font, script, language, or shape to remove all or user-specified text sections. Creating a general text eraser for use in real-world scenarios is difficult since it takes on the difficulties of both multi-lingual text detection and curved text inpainting. By adhering to these standards, our method significantly outperforms the state of the art on four benchmark datasets. This includes more complicated algorithms with auxiliary components.

The major goal is to create energy-efficient smart streetlights to conserve energy in already-existing streetlights in rural, urban, and just in smart cities. LED luminaire, LED driver, PV panel, charge controller, light sensor, motion sensor, and Arduino make up the system. The traffic on the road and the time of day or night are used to operate the smart streetlight. The system is set up to automatically shut off during daylight hours and only function at night, during periods of heavy rain, or during other inclement weather. When India is experiencing a power shortage, it is common to see street lights left on throughout the day. This is a complete waste of electricity. Another issue is that outdated street lights like sodium vapour, metal halide, incandescent, and fluorescent bulbs use more energy than modern LED lights. Using autonomously controlled, self-powered, efficient solar LED street lights, streetlights may be run for nothing. The main goal of this project is to advance the idea of a smart solar highway lighting system that works in tandem with wind turbines to reduce electrical waste and maximise energy conservation. There is no requirement for electrical energy from the electrical grid because we use solar energy in addition to wind energy. Along with reducing the load on the grid, we are also consuming less coal and lowering the quantity of harmful gases that are produced when coal is burned. Additionally, in the age of technological innovation, we are automating the system by employing smart sensors, which, when they detect a passing car, raise the LED lights' intensity and reduce them when the vehicle is stationary. This ensures that there are no manual mistakes in the project","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10059661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059661","Smart LED Street light;Solar;Arduino;Energy efficient;Street Lighting;Illumination","Technological innovation;Wind energy;Lighting;Coal;Solar energy;Light emitting diodes;Energy efficiency","","","","","","14","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But there is no ideal power network, the voltage value in the network changes frequently, thereby worsening the performance of the devices connected to it. This stabilizing device is not very sensitive to changes in voltage supplied through the common line. Voltage smoothing is done if the input voltage is in the range of 130 to 270 volts.

In a nutshell, the process of speech recognition may be broken down into three primary stages: auditory processing, extraction of features, and recognition of classification. The objective of feature extraction is to depict a voice signal by making use of a set number of signal components. This is due to the fact that all of the information contained in the acoustic signal is extremely difficult to process, and part of the information is not pertinent to the identification process. The Northern Goshawk Optimization algorithm, which identifies the distinct characteristics of the speech signal based on the extracted features, is utilised in the process of selecting the features to be used in the analysis.

The purpose of this research is to use MATLAB Simulink to optimise the artificial neural network component of the energy-based intrusion detection method. In this study, we demonstrate how an optimal approach inspired by biological nervous systems can boost intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

A star topology is a highly productive system where each sensor, including the server, is connected to a central hub (HAB) through a separate nodes segment. The main advantage of such a sensor is its resistance to failures due to malfunctions in individual sensors or sensor nodes damage. The most important feature of information exchange in local sensors are the so-called access methods (access methods), which regulate the order in which workstations access sensor resources and exchange data. The listed resources can be used in peer-to-peer sensors and sensors with a dedicated server. However, in a peer-to-peer sensor, its shortcomings are immediately revealed.

To address this matter, a plan for constant bridge monitoring via wireless IoT technology has been proposed. This new plan can be used for monitoring bridges and even flyovers. The structure is made up of interconnected sensors for measuring things like load, water level, vibration, and tilt, all of which are interfaced with communication devices. A database is used to record the current condition of a bridge. In this research, we employ ZigBee technology to create an Internet of Things-based bridge safety monitoring system. Devices for monitoring the bridge environment are part of this system, as are the communication devices that transmit data between the bridge monitoring device and the cloud server and the cloud server itself, which performs the necessary calculations and analyses on the data transmitted from the monitoring devices. Water levels, pipe pressure, air quality, and other potential threats to the bridge's integrity can all be tracked and analysed by this system in real time. To allow users to track the status of the bridge in real time using mobile communication devices, the collected data and photographs are uploaded to a server and database.

Thus it is confirmed that the DDoS attack detection and load balancing in cloud are most extreme issues which needs to be concerned more for the improved performance. This attained in this research work by measuring up the trust factors of virtual machines in order to predict the most trustable VMs which will be combined together to form the trustable source vector. After trust evaluation, in this work Bat algorithm is utilized for the optimal load distribution which will predict the optimal VM resource for the task allocation with the concern of budget. This method is most useful in the process of detecting the DDoS attacks happening on the VM resources. Finally prevention of DDOS attacks are performed by introducing the Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine Classifier which will learn the cloud resource setup details based on which DDoS attack detection can be prevented.

A safety system is activated, which monitors not only overload, but also “under load”. Therefore, in order to use the MP-3-3 as a laboratory, that is, with various loads, it must be loaded. The proposed to load each MP-3-3 output sources with starting loads, but, as practice shows; There is no need to do so. The fact is that the protection system does not monitor the currents in all the secondary windings of the pulse transformer. It is important for her to get the volume in the second round. Then, for any second round, it doesn't matter. In addition, to bring the source into stabilization mode, it must be loaded with at least 20W, and with the resistance of the resistors indicated in L.1, in total, no more than 3–4 W is obtained. Bring the source to operating mode, this is not enough.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060340","television network;load;under load;stabilization;starting load","Pulse generation;Resistors;TV;Windings;Safety;Transistors;Pulse transformers","","","","","","30","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, there are more significant uncertainties and disruptions in UAV environments, which makes inter automatic navigation more difficult. In this letter, I proposed a 2 recurrent neural networks (RL) oriented multi-UAV collision avoidance technique by modeling the unpredictability or noise in the environment. Our objective is to create a strategy that can construct a path without clashing with anything using local noisy data. But unlike supervised algorithms, RL lacks a steady training data set with floor labels, thus its collision avoidance strategies often show significant fluctuation and are difficult to reproduce. To solve these issues, we created a two-stage training method for RL-based collision avoidance. We first optimize the policy, and then we utilize a supervised learning methodology with a loss function that encourages the agents to adopt the well-known reciprocity obstacle detection mechanism. In the second step, we use transmission to fine-tune the policy. The complete computer simulation findings demonstrate that this approach can handle noisy local views with erratic sound levels and can design moment & accident paths under inadequate sensing. We review the impact of our policies in a variety of ways.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060228","","Training;Uncertainty;Supervised learning;Training data;Aircraft navigation;Sensors;Noise measurement","","","","","","12","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Almost all such patients experience at least some vocal degeneration; therefore voice data is an effective way to diagnose the disease. This paper presents a method for analyzing voice impairments by means of a system design in people who have PD and in people who are not afflicted with the disease. Various methodologies including Artificial Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and Random Forests were applied in this study. To test how well these algorithms can discriminate between PD and healthy subjects, the best accuracy predictor model can be determined out of this implemented model.

The word “contents” refers to any details taken from the image itself, including its colours, structures, textures, and other elements. Content based image Retrieval (CBIR) is preferred because the accuracy and comprehensiveness of annotations are crucial for searches that just use metadata. The CBIR approach is frequently used to recover images from huge, unformed image collections. Users are therefore dissatisfied with traditional knowledge acquisition techniques. Additionally, users now have access to more photographs because of the development of image creation and sharing. This access of the digital images have significant applications in many areas. To enable this quick access of the images, form the available image collection is a difficult task and requires more effective methods. The characteristic representation and similarity computation are key components that determine how effective a content-based picture retrieval system is. To overcome this problem, a CNN based feature extraction and classification-based image retrieval system have been proposed using SVM classfier.

However, in order to catch up on backlogs of work and attract new customers, fleet management is tempted to lease additional capabilities from CPs as a result of the present change in customer expectations and the growth of public cloud services (CPs).Understanding how the cloud administrators and the CPs interact is also critical in light of this. In this work, we investigate both correlations using a two-auction system. We construct the notion of cloud resource allocation using options available sequence auctions (OBSAs) for communications between users and service managers. When compared to earlier works, our design is able to handle customers with a variety of expectations, give sincerity as the dominant strategy, enjoy a simple winner choice process, and avoid the delay entry issue. We do provide one of the first OBSAs in the research with a higher output. In regard to the trades between cloud administrators and CPs, we propose two concurrent markets for energy collection. We can assess how narcissistic the CPs are by looking at the price they provide. We thoroughly examine the two markets to identify the bid strategies used by the cloud operators.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060523","CPs;Auction Mechanism;CCN;OBSA","Cloud computing;Correlation;Channel allocation;Delays;Resource management;Sustainable development","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some well-known manufacturers have already switched to the production of solid state drives, for example, Samsung sold the manufacturing business of hard drives to Seagate. Due to the current proportionally high cost of solid state drives, so-called hybrid hard drives have emerged, among others. Such devices combine a hard disk (HDD) and solid state drive relatively small size, as a temporary storage (to increase the performance and service life of the device, to reduce power consumption). These drives are built around the use of volatile memory (like that used in a personal computer's RAM), characterized by high -speed reading, writing, and searching for information. Their main disadvantage is the high cost. They are mainly used to speed up the work of large database management systems and powerful graphic workstations. Such drives are usually equipped with batteries to save data in the event of power loss, and more expensive models are equipped with backup and / or online backup systems. An example of such drivers is I-RAM. Users with enough RAM can organize a virtual machine and put it on the HDD RAM and evaluate the performance.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060030","devices;laptops;net books;communication;smart phones;memory;RAM","Performance evaluation;Computers;Protocols;Costs;Solid state drives;Random access memory;Data models","","","","","","43","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was initially used to train the proposed model, but after testing it with a CPU-trained neural network, it shows the lowest accuracy because it has only one hidden layer, while deep learning outperforms NN. The weight of the patient's eye will be determined by the model by calculating the weights. By integrating a large selection of well-known classification algorithms into one sophisticated diagnostic model, an ensemble-based learning strategy was evaluated. The proposed framework achieved the highest accuracy rates among all other common classification algorithms. Identifying the threshold for each feature class is the most challenging part of this study. In order to identify the target class thresholds, we used a weighted fuzzy C-means algorithm.

Deep learning (DL) methods are currently considered state-of-the-art for image processing, classification, and retrieval. Rotation is a frequent way to change the geometric shape of an image. However, due to the usage of anisotropic filters for convolution, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) do not support rotation invariance characteristics. Therefore, the ability to rotate images without changing their essential qualities is a promising new area of research in the field of image processing. In this research, we suggest using feature-pretrained CNN model combinations for classification and comparable image retrieval; these models were trained on a large picture database that included images that had been rotated and scaled. This method yields excellent classification and retrieval results for the Corel dataset, both for the original query images and when rotated and scaled.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060034","Content based Image Retrieval CNN;RestNet;VGG 19;DenseNet201","Training;Deep learning;Shape;Databases;Convolution;Image processing;Image retrieval","","","","","","38","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a wireless sensor network (WSN), we demonstrate the three-tier architecture of a healthcare monitoring system prototype we've constructed to keep tabs on key patient vitals. Connecting various biosensors to an Arduino Nano board allows for the wireless transmission of recorded signals to a server, where they may be analyzed. Thing Speak is an internet of things (IOT) application that transmits data to remote servers where it may be accessed by doctors and caretakers. Smartphone alerts can be sent to carer's in the event of an emergency.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has the adaptability and flexibility for the development on-grid as well as off-grid residential solar systems. The type of converter presented in this paper has a range of advantages. The most important of which is the ability to generate both DC and AC boosted outputs simultaneously in a single stage. The converter will operate in two different modes, i) Differential Mode for generating AC output and ii) Interleaved Mode for generating DC output with the help of level shifted SPWM technique. This type of converter can directly connect source to the load either AC or DC types. The following methodology has been demonstrated using Simulink design. The proposed converter is operated for a given input voltage of 32.5 V(PV panel) and boosting up to 50V for AC output, simulation is performed on a split-phase induction machine (1/35 Hp, 220V, 50Hz) as ac load and up to 90V for DC output with resistive load (100 Ohms) and its output values can be varied by changing the firing angle value. The proposed converter has a great capability with higher efficiency with respect to the existing converters, lesser number of switches and with reduction in the size of the filters used on the load side that can be use in wide range of applications which includes industrial, domestic as well as in agricultural.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10059955","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059955","An interleaved boost converter (IBC);Differential Boost Inverter (DBI);Renewable energy;Solar energy;efficiency","Photovoltaic systems;Software packages;Prototypes;Voltage;Mathematical models;Topology;Solar system","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This gadget is crucial since numerous gases can hurt humans and animals. Containment in areas where the gas shouldn't be avoided. A minor leak can build up an explosive gas concentration, making leaks exceedingly dangerous. The current gas detector is less effective because the user can only detect gas leaks by utilising it. It's risky because gas leaks must be found early. The Gas Leakage Detector with Alert System was created to prevent fire or explosion in homes or businesses. This gas detector continually detects gas if it has power. Arduino UNO was utilised as the CPU to process sensor information and deliver an SMS alert to the user.

Uchida et al. proposed an ALR (Adaptive Link Rate) switching method for OpenFlow networks based on the traffic splitting method. Their method split the traffic to a bypass based on DSCP field so that the link on the shortest path can remain low speed when the traffic is at an “intermediate” rate. However, the method merely considered the situation where only one site communicates with a different site which has a gateway into the Internet. When multiple sites in the same organization network adopt this method, a conflict will be caused since the bypass may not only be a bypass but also be the shortest path for other sites.

In this paper, we assess the privacy risk of Web browsing history from the viewpoint of the identity match rate. The rate roughly evaluates the percentage of the following event in Web browsing history; Given a user's Web access data in a period, exactly the same user has the most similar Web access data in another period among all users in a group. If the identity match rate is high, there are many users whose Web access data in two distinct periods are the closest to each other and linkable. Therefore, it can be said that the privacy risk of such Web browsing history is high. In our privacy risk assessment, we pay attention to browsers' bookmarks. Bookmarks may have a higher privacy risk because they tend to reflect user preferences. In order to give evidence of it, we evaluate the identity match rate with the knowledge of bookmarks. Additionally, we take into account the timestamp and the category of the website for the evaluation. The analyses show that the identity match rate becomes the highest when bookmarks are used, which indicates the high privacy risk.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00075","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062816","Web browsing history;Privacy;Bookmark","Privacy;Conferences;Companies;Search engines;Browsers;History;Risk management","","","","","","8","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Functional chiplets of a system are necessary to be connected with a high-performance, high-flexibility, and area-efficient interconnect switch chip. In this work, a reconfigurable switch whose internal connection topology can be dynamically changed for different applications is proposed for future super-large integrated chiplet systems. We implement the essential modules of a switch design, the arbiter and the distributor, as hard function blocks for the novel switch-specific reconfigurable architecture. By using these function blocks that are directly implemented with the ASIC process (hard logic) instead of consuming general LUTs (soft logic), higher area-efficiency and performance can be achieved. Since the switch configuration depends on the user's application, a development environment for users is required. We also designed a user switch design flow. Users can get the switch through their descriptions instead of writing codes by themselves. The users' description file provides the information of hard function blocks so that we can get the verilog file of the switch by switch generator. And then generate the blif file from verilog file for packing and placement. In a conclusion, we implemented two hard function blocks in FPGA architecture which can realize high-performance and area-efficient interconnect switch chip. And successfully designed a switch generation flow to help users get the target switch from their description.

Despite its benefits, SDN architecture also presents new security challenges, in particular, those related to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Many current approaches have used statistical techniques, such as entropy, or Machine Learning (ML) to detect these attacks. However, there is an important trade-off between these approaches. The definition of a threshold that determine whether particular traffic is spurious or not is not trivial in statistical techniques. ML solutions may provide better accuracy as compared to statistical techniques, but require considerable computational resources and time to converge. Current hybrid approaches try to balance between these two approaches by either using the results from entropy as input in ML algorithms (Entropy → ML) or using entropy as a filter and ML algorithms to identify attacks. By combining these techniques, this paper presents a 3-step solution (Entropy → ML→ Entropy) called ML-Entropy which inherits the intelligence of ML algorithms to dynamically adjust the threshold used by entropy, improving the separation of legitimate from spurious traffic with reduced error rates. The solution was implemented and evaluated in a real-corporate environment. The experimental results show that the attack detection accuracy of ML-Entropy surpasses 99%, providing superior results as compared to entropy and its combination with ML algorithms.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062716","SDN;Entropy;Machine Learning;DDoS;SVR","Machine learning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning;Network architecture;Filtering algorithms;Denial-of-service attack;Entropy","","","","","","34","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper proposes an evacuation system based on the information sharing scheme which uses both mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks flexibly. The users share the disaster information among users through the MANET and the cellular network. In the MANET, the mobile terminals are managed by groups which are configured by nearby terminals called clusters. The cluster consists of one cluster head, which manages the cluster, and cluster members. The cluster head which receives the disaster information from the cluster members in the cluster through the MANET shares the collected disaster information among other cluster heads through the cellular network. The proposed evacuation system can mitigate the traffic of the cellular networks because only cluster heads access to the base stations to share them.

Specifically, unlinkable posts can be changed to named posts, and when the name is changed, it is guaranteed that the person who posted the anonymous post was really the anonymous writer and that the anonymous writer cannot be identified from the anonymous post. We introduced randomized pseudonyms to prevent the viewer from checking a post text based only on the posting name without checking the contents of the posting.

That is, all packets cannot advance toward their destinations because all of them are waiting on one another to release buffers. To solve this problem, this paper proposes two load-balancing routing algorithms, cycle-check and waiting-time, to avoid deadlocks and reduce packet delays.

The main contribution of this paper is to present the bit duplication technique, which can generate a hard QUBO problem from any QUBO problem so that their optimal solutions take the same energy value. The idea of the bit duplication technique is to duplicate bits and then to give constraints so that the corresponding two bits take the same binary values. By this technique, any QUBO problem with $n$ bits is converted to a hard QUBO problem with $2n$ bits. We use random QUBO problems and N-Queen QUBO problems for experiments. The performance of QUBO solvers including Gurobi optimizer, Fixstars Amplify AE, OpenJij with SA, D-Wave Hybrid solver, and ABS QUBO solver are evaluated for solving these QUBO problems. The experimental results show that generated QUBO problems by the bit duplication technique are much harder than the original QUBO problems. Hence, the bit duplication technique is a potent method to generate hard QUBO problems and generated QUBO problems can be used as benchmark problems for evaluating the search performance of QUBO solvers.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062832","Quantum computing;combinatorial optimization;benchmark;hard problems","Quantum computing;Conferences;Benchmark testing;Search problems;Optimization","","","","","","23","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a type of pairing friendly curves, Guillevic et al. presented parameters for Cocks-Pinch curve with embedding degree $k=5,6,7,8$. Furthermore, Nanjo et al. proposed that the computational cost of the pairing on the Cocks-Pinch curve with embedding degree $k=6$ is the second candidate for the BLS curve with embedding degree $k=12$ at the 128-bit security level. Therefore, the authors propose and improve Optimal-Ate pairing on Cocks-Pinch curve with embedding degree $k=6$ in Affine coordinates. Specifically, Miller's algorithm for Optimal-Ate pairing is optimized for Cocks-Pinch curves, and an effective Pseudo 4-sparse multiplication is derived and implemented. We adopt and implement a compressed squaring, which efficiently computes the squares to the final exponentiation of Optimal-Ate pairing.

Since random numbers are used to generate nonce and encryption keys, degradation of the randomness generated by TRNGs (True Random Number Generators) causes damage to system security. Several attacks have been proposed to reduce the randomness of the TRNG by changing the operating conditions, such as frequency injection, glitch impact, temperature change, and power supply voltage manipulation. In addition, the side-channel attack against TRNG is proposed to predict the random number output. This paper evaluates temperature variation and proposes side-channel attacks against COSO-based TRNG (coherent sampling ring oscillator-based TRNG). The results show that the temperature variation does not affect the randomness of the TRNG under the temperature range of 0°C to 80°C. On the other hand, the side-channel attack correctly read the random output numbers in 97.9 % of the cases. Note that the target circuit was connected to the output pin and side channel information was obtained from it. We propose two countermeasures against the side-channel attacks and demonstrate their effectiveness.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062476","TRNG;COSO-based TRNG;Side-Channel Attack;Temperature Attack","Temperature distribution;Power supplies;Reverse engineering;Side-channel attacks;Voltage;Pins;Security","","","","","","19","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, Fuchsbauer, Plouviez, and Seurin gave a tight reduction that proves EUF-CmA of Sch in the random oracle (ROM) with the algebraic group model (AGM) from the discrete logarithm (DL) assumption at EUROCRYPT 2020. Kiltz, Masny, and Pan also considered multi-user security of Sch at CRYPTO 2016, whereas Fuchsbauer et al. only considered single-user security. More precisely, Kiltz et al. constructed a tight reduction from EUF-CmA to mU-EUF-CMA. Combining these two results will likely enable us to construct a tight reduction that proves MU-EUF-CMA security of Sch in AGM+ROM from DL assumption. Against such an intuition, we show an impossibility on proving MU-EUF-CMA of Sch in AGM+ROM only by combining them in this paper. To estimate our impossibility result, we also discuss why the result by Fuchsbauer et al. cannot be applied to MU-EUF-CMA setting. Our result therefore suggests that we are required to develop a new proof technique beyond the algebraic reduction or to find a new form of public keys other than that considered in our impossibility, in order to show MU-EUF-CMA of Sch in AGM+ROM.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062618","Schnorr Signature;Algebraic Group Model;Algebraic Reduciton;Multi-user Security;Impossibility","Computational modeling;Conferences;Public key;Security;Read only memory","","","","","","33","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, of the total 340,000 tons of cheese produced in Japan and imported by the country in 2018, domestic production was only 44,000 tons and had declined yearly. This situation is undesirable for maintaining the domestic dairy industry and food security. In addition, the government and local governments are currently promoting the sixth industrialization of the dairy industry. In order to meet this demand, it is necessary to increase the domestic production of dairy products. However, since competing with imported products on price is not viable, it is necessary to add value to dairy products. One of the measures to achieve this purpose is to increase the quality of dairy products through pasturage. Grazing allows cows to be managed in a more natural environment with less stress; thus, higher quality raw milk can be expected. Our research focuses on the health status of the cow's rumen, which is directly related to the health status of a cow. The health status of the cow's rumen often deteriorates due to overeating.

In federated learning, communication is performed between the server and edge devices to exchange weight parameters, but ResNet has deep layers and a large number of parameters, so communication size becomes large. In this paper, we use Neural ODE as a lightweight model of ResNet to reduce communication size in federated learning. In addition, we newly introduce a flexible federated learning using Neural ODE models with different number of iterations, which correspond to ResNet with different depths.

Specifically, challenges for the GLIDE model of image generation from text are: controlling the number of objects, scale conversion, instability of generation (objects indicated in the text do not appear in the image), and unnatural object structure. In addition, the task of generating images from textual information alone is so flexible that it is difficult to derive the relevance and requires a large number of data for training. In fact, the training of current generative models often uses hundreds of millions of text-image pairs. The large scale of the generative model itself makes the training cost enormous. In this study, we propose and validate a new image generation method that uses segmentation and text as input. That is, image generation from text is assisted by segmentation information. This should solve issues that GLIDE had difficulty with, such as controlling the number of objects, scale conversion, unstable generation, and unnatural object structure. Furthermore, the goal is to reduce the number of data needed for training by making it easier to find the relationship between textual information and image generation. As a result of the verification, our model achieved FID-10k score of 17.12 after training with only about 120,000 training data, and it was confirmed that it is capable of handling complex layouts and maintaining natural object structure even with a large number of objects.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062530","Image Generation;text-to-image synthesis;Diffusion Models;Multimodal","Training;Image segmentation;Costs;TV;Image synthesis;Layout;Training data","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since many recent packets are encrypted with TLS, it is important to study a method that can be applied to packets encrypted with TLS. As a method applicable for TLS encrypted data, a method based on the occurring SNI and Bayesian inference was proposed. This method searches the previously investigated occurrence SNI database for the SNI occurrence vector that perfectly matches the SNI occurrence vector of the IP flow to be identified. This method gives up identification if there is no occurrence SNI vector pair that perfectly matches. This giving up identification is considered to decrease its accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method for improving the accuracy by excluding SNIs that are not important for identification. This exclusion reduces giving up identification. We consider SNIs that have a low occurrence probability and SNIs that occur only in the traffic to be identified as non-important SNIs, and identify the service without these non-important SNIs.

However, there are growing concerns about privacy violations due to the use of private data. In response to such concerns, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced to regulate the handling of personal information. GDPR makes it difficult to discover medical knowledge through big data analysis in medical studies. However, GDPR is not con-cerned with handling non-personally identifiable statistical information. Statistical information is commonly published, collected, and analyzed. Yet, it is unknown whether collecting and analyzing such statistical information can generate medical evidence through variable-to-variable research, such as the relationship between tobacco and cancer. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to use statistical information that is not concerned by GDPR to estimate cross-tabulation tables, which are usually generated from personal information in medical research and are widely used for analysis between medical variables. In particular, as statistical information, we use “patient characteristics” formatted data, commonly published in medical research. The scope of this paper is the situation where the publisher of statistical information and the analyst of published statistical information differ. On the publisher side, we assume the publisher collects raw data from a target people group by random sampling multiple times and converts the data to patient characteristics formatted data. On the analyst side, we assume the analyst collects those published many random sampled patient characteristics formatted data and estimates the cross-tabulation table by the Law of Large Numbers (LLN). Theoretically, we model the publisher-analyst situation described above. Practically, we validate the model by experiment. In the experiment, the target people group data is 20000 personal data which have four categorical binary values. As the publisher model, we created 10000 patient characteristics, which are statistics for randomly sampled 50 data from the 20000 data. As the analyst model, we estimated the cross-tabulation table by the 10000 patient characteristics. As the results of 100 times patient characteristics creation and estimation experiments, we obtained the cross-tabulation tables with less than or equal to 1.5% error (2 standard deviations (SD)). From these results, we conclude that our proposed model of publishing and collecting patient characteristics formatted data allows precise estimation of the cross-tabulation table.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062534","Random sampling;health care;patient characteristics","Data privacy;Publishing;Conferences;Estimation;Big Data;Knowledge discovery;Data models","","","","","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem has practical applications in a distributed setting, and studied well in the distributed computing community. In this paper, we propose a new problem called the minus ($L, K, Z$) -domination problem where $L, K$, and $Z$ are integers such that $L\leq-1,K\geq 1$, and $Z\geq 1$. The minus ($L, K, Z$) -domination problem is a problem to assign a value $L, L+1, \ldots, 0, \ldots, K-1, K$ for each vertex in a graph such that the local summation of values is greater than or equal to $Z$. Because it is the same as the minus domination problem when $L=-1, K=1$ and $Z=1$, it is an extension of the minus domination problem. Then, we propose a self-stabilizing distributed algorithm for the minus ($L, K, Z$) -domination problem, where self-stabilization is a class of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms that tolerate arbitrary finite number of transient faults. The proposed algorithm is designed under the distance-2 model and the unfair central daemon, and its convergence time is $O(n)$, that is, linear to $n$, where $n$ is the number of processes. If it is converted into the ordinary distance-1 model with a transformer, we obtain an algorithm whose convergence time is $O(nm)$.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062715","minus domination;dominating set;combinatorial optimization;self-stabilization;distributed algorithm","Fault tolerance;Conferences;Computational modeling;Fault tolerant systems;Transformers;Distributed algorithms;Time complexity","","","","","","9","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, from classical models (variational models, morphological models, etc.) to convolutional networks. Hybrid models consider the advantages of the convolutional networks to select features and the generalization capacities of the classical models to extrapolate data. A hybrid model that considers convolutional stages and an interpolator has been proposed in the literature. This model assumes an anisotropic metric gij and the image domain (Ω), embedding the data in a Riemannian manifold $M$ = (gij, Ω). The interpolation task is performed by solving a degenerated partial differential equation in this manifold M. The proposed metric gij used in this manifold is fundamental to correctly estimate distances between points in the sparse depth data. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold: first, an empirical evaluation of a metric based on a Positive Definite Operator Metric to compare color pixels applied to the depth completion task, and second, a variation of the infinity Laplacian (also the biased infinity Laplacian), namely unbalanced infinity Laplacian (unbalanced biased infinity Laplacian). Both interpolators include a weight map that balances the contribution of different models in the interpolation process. Experimental results in the KITTI Depth Completion Suite dataset, which is publicly available, show that the use of the Positive Definite Metric Operator performs better than the other two models and also performs better than similar models in this dataset.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062650","Infinity Laplacian;geodesic metric;depth completion","Measurement;Manifolds;Interpolation;Laplace equations;Three-dimensional displays;Data models;Mathematical models","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The construction of the hierarchical matrix is achieved by dividing a matrix into submatrices (partitioning), followed by calculating these submatrices' entries (filling). The matrix partitioning is divided into two sub-steps: cluster tree (CT) construction by dividing objects into clusters, hierarchically, and block cluster tree (BCT) construction by observing all cluster pairs at the same level of the cluster tree that satisfy a given admissibility condition. We can apply task parallelism to filling by treating each submatrix as a parallelization unit. In existing implementations, the partitioning is redundantly executed on every computing node, and filling is executed in parallel by assigning a set of tasks to each worker statically. However, we cannot get good load balance using such implementations because it is difficult to predict the workload of each task precisely. In this paper, we propose a new parallel implementation of the hierarchical matrix construction, where a BCT construction is executed in parallel using all workers of all computing nodes. When a worker finds a BCT leaf during BCT construction, it executes filling for the submatrix corresponding to the leaf. To get good load balance, we parallelized the BCT construction using the task parallel language Tascell, which enables easy and efficient parallelization of tree recursive algorithms by employing a dynamic load balancing strategy. In numerical experiments with 3D electric field analyses using up to 16 computing nodes each of which has 36 cores, our implementation achieved up to 1.9-fold speedups compared to an implementation using the static task assignment strategy.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062615","hierarchical matrix;dynamic load balancing;task parallel language;Tascell","Parallel languages;Three-dimensional displays;Correlation;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Parallel processing;Load management","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to support for the creation of high-quality CWs, a method using an optimization technique has been developed, recently. In the method, fashion images are converted into certain vocabulary through image processing techniques, and a quasi-optimal CW is then derived by submodular optimization with respect to the compatibility and versatility which are calculated based on the LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model. However, the two metrics of compatibility and versatility are not always sufficient to meet the various demands of users.

Therefore, the research on value reading of instrument equipment in substation is particularly key. At present, for the instrument recognition of substation, most studies use traditional image processing and machine learning methods. However, in the recognition process, due to the influence of uneven illumination, complex background, rotation angle, image blur, shooting angle, proportion change and other factors, the recognition accuracy of pointer instrument is low and its usability is poor. In order to solve the above problems, this paper combines the traditional image processing technology with the deep learning method, and proposes an automatic recognition method of substation pointer instrument based on deformable convolutional neural network. The idea of deformable volume is introduced to enhance the modeling ability of convolutional neural network, so as to improve the accuracy of instrument recognition. The main idea is that firstly, the deformable convolution neural network method is used to detect the instrument image in the image, then the residual neural network is used to extract the key points of the instrument dial and pointer, then the detected key points are used to fit the dial circle and pointer, and finally the readout value is calculated according to the deflection angle of the pointer relative to the scale.

The advantage of capsule network is to deal with the spatial relationship between feature vectors, while Chinese characters happen to be a spatial structure composed of strokes, radicals and radicals placed in different positions. However, due to the large number of parameters of the capsule network, it is difficult to train large size images and easy to over fit. In view of the shortcomings of capsule network, the following two improvements are proposed: First, the use of PD (Pixel shuffle down sampling) enables the model to train large images without losing pixel information, while reducing image noise. Secondly, the number of primary capsules is reduced by using multi-layer small windows instead of single-layer large windows to extract image features, so as to reduce the number of model parameters. The experimental results show that, with the increase of training picture size and the decrease of capsule network parameters, the recognition accuracy is significantly improved. The accuracy of the improved capsule network for taking 300 Chinese characters from CASIA-HWDB1.1 dataset can reach 95.97%, and the parameter quantity is only 7.95M, which proves the advantages and effectiveness of the improved model.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10061975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061975","handwritten Chinese character recognition;Ca-psnet;parameter reduction;PD;overfitting mitigation","Training;Handwriting recognition;Technological innovation;Feature extraction;Character recognition","","","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Parameter pruning is one of the predominant approaches for compressing deep models, which can reduce redundant parameters, reduce communication overhead, and improve the timeliness of information transmission while maintaining the performance of neural networks. Currently, most pruning methods focus on the importance of pruned objects in the overall task. Unlike previous methods, this paper ranks the similarity of the filters in the neural network using the sum of matrix similarity measures based on cosine similarity, removing the most similar and most replaceable filters. We validate the pruning method on CIFAR10 and ImageNet ILSVRC2012 using different network architectures.

However, there is a significant accuracy gap between BNNs and networks with wider bit-width. Conventional BNNs binarize feature maps by static globally-unified thresholds, which makes the produced bipolar image lose local details. This paper proposes a multi-input activation function to enable adaptive thresholding for binarizing feature maps: (a) At the algorithm level, instead of operating each input pixel independently, adaptive thresholding dynamically changes the threshold according to surrounding pixels of the target pixel. When optimizing weights, adaptive thresholding is equivalent to an accompanied depth-wise convolution between normal convolution and binarization. Accompanied weights in the depth-wise filters are also binarized and optimized end-to-end. (b) At the hardware level, adaptive thresholding is realized through a multi-input activation function, which is compatible with common accelerator architectures. Compact activation hardware with only one extra accumulator is devised. By equipping the proposed method on FPGA, 4.1% accuracy improvement is achieved on the original BNN with only 1.1% extra LUT resource. Compared with State-of-the-art methods, the proposed idea further increases network accuracy by 0.8% on the Cifar-10 dataset and 0.4% on the ImageNet dataset.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062599","Binary Neural Network;Adaptive Thresholding;Algorithm/Hardware Co-Design;Neural Network Accelerator","","","","","","","24","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the lack of a certain category of data (i.e., healthy or faulty) and the various working conditions of wind turbines, many existing methods may not provide reliable results in practical industrial applications. To solve this problem, we create an industrial internet of things (IIoT) platform, through which a machine learning-based adaptive fault detection method for wind turbine gearboxes is proposed. The features are extracted and adapted to fine-tune the pre-trained model on newly arriving samples from different wind turbines, components, or failure modes. The adaptation performance is evaluated with accuracy, false alarm rate, and fault detection rate. Case studies are then performed using highfrequency vibration signals acquired from two megawatts (MW) onshore wind turbines. The results show that the proposed adaptive method significantly improves the fault detection performance when class distribution is not balanced, and can be easily applied to the fault diagnosis of large numbers of wind turbines. This, integrated with the IIoT platform that alleviates the shortage of computational and storage capacity in wind farms and requires less user involvement, allows for a more effective condition monitoring system.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062283","industrial internet of things (IIoT);condition monitoring;adaptive fault detection;imbalanced data;wind turbine gearbox","Adaptation models;Fault detection;Wind farms;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor fusion;Maintenance engineering;Feature extraction","","","","","","11","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the denoising part, this paper firstly preprocesses the L channel of the image, so as to retain more color information in the subsequent processing. Secondly, according to the noise distribution characteristics of low illumination image, the image is denoised by adaptive bilateral filtering.

The diffusion state of clouds with different coal dust particle sizes is analyzed, and the idea of dust suppression and the direction to be explored are put forward. The results show that the shape of the airflow at the entrance of the tunnel changes in a 'trumpet' shape. The influence range of the airflow on the X-Z and X-Y sections conforms to different forms of migration laws. The influence range of the vortex at the entrance of the tunnel is positively correlated with the position of the train.

During recent decades, A popular area of study now is the efficient location and detection of bird nests on transmission line towers. As deep learning technology has advanced and hardware processing power has increased, using deep learning technology can be gained by utilizing deep learning technology for bird’s nest target recognition. This research suggests a technique for detecting bird nests on transmission system towers through YOLOv5. The method consists of input, backbone, neck, and prediction. By introducing pre-training weights and various data enhancement methods, After multiple network training sessions, it is feasible to find and recognize the bird’s nest on the power system’ tower. The outcomes reveal that the YOLOv5 model’s mean average precision (mAP) of the bird’s nest on the top of power tower can reach 85.6%, and the model is only 14.4 MB in size.

Gradual fading of the multipath components avoids unwanted artifacts caused by the updating of the scatterers and a dynamic K-factor incorporates the influence of the distance between transmitter and receiver on the power delay profile of the channel.

Researchers have determined hook points based on experimental knowledge or reading the source code of operating systems (OSes). However, reading the source codes of OS requires specialized knowledge. In addition, the appropriate hook point differs among OS versions. Therefore, analyzing the source code in each OS update is impractical. We propose a method for estimating the hook point using a memory analysis technique. The proposed method acquires the memory of the monitored VM and then searches for an appropriate instruction appropriate to hook. The search instructions depend on the processor architecture. Therefore, the proposed method does not require knowledge of OS versions or reading the source code of OSes. The experimental results showed that the proposed method precisely estimates the hook point.

Labor volume of cotton bale handling is large and the working environment is bad. In order to enhance the efficiency of the bale handling robot, a grey wolf optimization algorithm based on Chebyshev mapping and dynamic weight is proposed. First of all, for the problem of substantial randomness and extreme instability of the initial population of Gray Wolf algorithm, Chebyshev map is used to initialize the population. Using the monotonic increasing characteristic of tangent function interval to improve the convergence factor, the convergence speed in the initial stage of the algorithm needs to be improved. The improved weight strategy is adopted to join the non elite wolf to lead the population optimization, which improves the convergence rate of the algorithm and the performance of jumping out of local optimization. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm significantly improves the optimization performance, has a faster convergence speed and higher optimization accuracy.

Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic community detection algorithm based on the similarity of social network nodes (DCDSN). The algorithm calculates the static similarity between nodes through structural and attribute similarity according to the three influence factors of direct influence, common neighbor and exclusive neighbor. The algorithm uses the influence of historical network information on current network information to obtain the dynamic similarity between nodes, establishes a weighted dynamic social network, then uses Louvain algorithm to achieve dynamic community detection.

Therefore, some researchers are focusing on generating images with large unrestricted corruption. However, existing unrestricted images are noticeable, arousing human suspicion.

However, there is no petrophysical method in the logging data that can directly evaluate the average rock size, and previous work has been done to calculate the average rock size (Md) based on linear and statistical analysis methods using natural gamma logging data for medium to high permeability sandstone reservoirs. However, for low-permeability sandstone reservoirs, the error of the fitted average rock size using linear multiple regression methods is too large for the application of the calculated results. Therefore, the calculation of the median particle size for low-permeability sandstone reservoirs is a difficult problem that needs to be solved. In this paper, for low-permeability sandstone reservoirs, we combine the characteristics of logging data with the learning characteristics of nonlinear mapping of BP neural networks, and select the corresponding loss and activation functions to ensure that overfitting occurs. Using the preferred sensitivity logging parameters, the average rock size is modeled and neighboring wells are predicted by shallow and deep neural networks, and the relative errors of modeling are 7.09% and 0.58%, and the relative errors of prediction are 14.44% and 8.53%, respectively. Its quantitative prediction relative error meets the application requirements. The method takes into account the nonlinear mapping relationship between logging data and the fitting problem of small sample data, and provides a systematic way of thinking for predicting rock size of low-permeability sandstone from logging curves.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062233","low-permeability sandstone;average rock size;conventional logging;BP algorithm;deep neural network","Deep learning;Sensitivity;Systematics;Neural networks;Fitting;Predictive models;Rocks","","","","","","8","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are problems nowadays such as complex alarm data structure, insufficient data correlation among multiple power stations, and difficulties to detect internal insecure operations, hence threatening the security and stability of the power monitoring system. A multi-power station alarm data correlation traceability analysis model that integrates density clustering and SOM algorithm is proposed, which quantifies the multi-dimensional characteristics of the raw alarm data. Based on the density clustering algorithm of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), results of spatial correlation analysis conducted can be clearly detected geographically. Meanwhile, the SOM (Self-organizing Maps) algorithm is used to perform secondary extraction of features in the filtered data. It improves the feature display of the attack chain, and realizes the correlation traceability of multi-power station data by mining internal aggressive behavior and its characteristics. Experimental results on the real alarm data set show that the model can efficiently capture several pieces of correlation data of the target alarm data between multiple power stations, covering the time and space dimensions, and displaying the correlation traceability results in the form of attack link graphs. The methods of analysis and network boundary detection have been effectively supplemented, which can greatly escalate the ability of the power monitoring system to analyze and process massive alarm data, and reveal the propagation path of attack behavior among multiple power stations. Eventually, this strategy ensures the security and the stability of the power monitoring system.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062093","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062093","density clustering;self-organizing network;alarm data;attack source tracing;log analysis","Self-organizing feature maps;Correlation;Clustering algorithms;Power system stability;Data models;Stability analysis;Security","","","","","","5","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the application of urgent observation, two objectives are considered simultaneously, i.e., time cost and energy cost. A good plan makes sure that all the targets are observed as soon as possible, and the overall energy consumption as low as possible. The problem is formulated as a multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP) with multiple depots, known as a nondeterministic polynomial-hard problem. A preference-based multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Preferred range of each objective is used as preference information, and the algorithm aims at Pareto optimal solutions that match the preference. Through computational experiments, the benefit of the proposed algorithm (T-MOEA/D-2opt) is demonstrated by comparing with other existing algorithms. Experimental results show that T-MOEA/D-2opt is effective and efficient in finding preferred Pareto solutions for this path planning problem.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062135","path planning;multi-UAV;preference;multi-objective evolutionary algorithm","Technological innovation;Costs;Three-dimensional displays;Heuristic algorithms;Reconnaissance;Traveling salesman problems;Search problems","","","","","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the process of selecting sub-criteria, measurable and quantifiable are the primary considerations in order to eliminate uncertainty of fuzzy values from qualitative indicators. An improved Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method is applied to determine weights of indexes and ranking of RES development, which shows reduced subjectivity and improved computing speed. Finally, a case study of Qinghai in China is analyzed and discussed in RES exploitation priorities, general weights of sub-criteria with respect to overall objective and weights of RES alternatives under every main criterion.

Relevant studies have shown that Free Space Optical (FSO) technology can bring flexible topologies, high speed transmission and low energy consumption to data centers. However, it can also make the cloud data broadcast in the data center space. Some work has shown that outdoor FSO channel is vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to the combined attenuation effects of atmospheric turbulence and long distance transmission. Unfortunately, it is not clear the security of FSO channel in data centers and there are few studies discussing it. We study the physical layer security of FSO link in the data center indoor scenario. A suitable tapping channel model was given based on the viable mechanism of eavesdrop communication in data center. We also numerically simulate the FSO eavesdropping channel in short distance and study the impact of the relevant factors on probability of secrecy capacity. The results show that in data centers, only path attenuation of FSO also poses a channel eavesdropping risk. Under certain conditions, the distance of a few tens of meters combined with the use of shorter wavelengths can result in serious channel security risks. At the same time, the use of long wavelengths or special window wavelengths with small attenuation of FSO in FSO-based data centers has significantly improved channel security.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10061939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061939","Data center network;Free space optical;Physical layer security;Secrecy","Wireless communication;Data centers;Wavelength measurement;Optical attenuators;Physical layer security;Optical variables measurement;Attenuation","","","","","","14","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The face regions and the SIFT feature regions are viewed as the regions of interest (ROIs) that require privacy protection. In the scrambling encryption step, the ROIs are combined to improve the scrambling effect. Each ROI adopts a different chaotic sequence in the diffusible encryption step to enhance chaos complexity.

The traditional artificial target-marking system has the disadvantages of low safety factor, poor timeliness, large manpower consumption, poor precision and low efficiency, and it cannot meet the needs of launch test or training task in modern and information age. Optical measurement, such as high-speed video recording, is easy to be influenced by environment, and especially when there is the complex shooting range environment, the measurement data are easy to be influenced by weather, illumination and shooting range environment, etc. Furthermore, a large amount of dust and smoke produced from the explosion process can interfere with the projectile positioning accuracy. The remote sensing measurement method to identify the projectile penetration position have many problems, such as high cost, poor timeliness and low flexibility. In view of that, the acoustic positioning measurement method of projectile penetration process is proposed, which has the advantages of large monitoring range and being unaffected by visibility. A randomly arranged 16-channels transmitter array is used to receive sound pressure signals, and a digital acquisition device using corresponding audio interfaces is used to transmit the collected signal to a computer. A total of 5 seconds of audio signals are obtained and intercepted before and after the shell hits the target, and the signal is analyzed in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Based on the conventional beamforming (CBF) algorithm and the CLEAN-SC algorithm, the projectile location during ignition, launch and penetration process is studied. The results showed that both the CBF and the CLEAN-SC algorithms can accurately locate the explosive position of gunpowder and the first impact position of the projectile on the target plate.

Then, we adopt the cross-validation grid search algorithm to optimize the parameters of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to establish the optimal power demand forecasting model.

Carbon emissions are inevitably related to economic development. China needs to reach peak carbon emissions as early as possible to achieve economic and industrial transformation. The domestic economy should adapt to the new normal and new trends, so that the carbon peak can be achieved by 2030, thereby promoting green circular and low-carbon development and transformation. In this paper, based on Kaya identity and artificial intelligence algorithm, combined with the changing characteristics of urban carbon emissions in Jilin Province, the LMDI factor decomposition model of carbon emissions in Jilin Province is constructed. Using the basic parameters of GDP, population size, industrial scale, and carbon emissions from 2005 to 2021, the factors of carbon emissions in various cities in Jilin Province were obtained, and three scenarios were set for benchmarks, low carbon emissions, and technological breakthroughs to obtain the rate of change for each driving change. Then, the carbon peak year was finally calculated for each scenario. The conclusions are drawn as follows: 1. The urban factorization results showed that the per capita output effect is the main driving force behind the increase in carbon emissions, while the industrial structure effect and industrial carbon intensity effect has an inhibitory effect on the growth of carbon emissions; 2. The carbon peak years under the three scenarios were 2029, 2027, and 2026 respectively, and carbon emissions will drop rapidly after reaching the peak in the technological breakthrough scenario. This paper provides a reference for Jilin Province in achieving the goal of the carbon peak.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10061908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061908","artificial intelligence algorithm;carbon peak;Kaya's equation;scenario architecture;forecast model","Technological innovation;Urban areas;Sociology;Force;Carbon dioxide;Predictive models;Market research","","","","","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

State-of-the-art LMTC methods are mostly based on deep neural networks trained using a cross-entropy loss. These methods require massive human labeled training data to capture the underlying label correlations implicitly, which could be a burden in real-world applications. We observe that many correlated labels are missed by human annotators, but their label names in fact co-occur often in document contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel text classification framework FLC, incorporating “free” label correlations derived from massive raw text corpora. Specifically, we design a principled similarity measurement to evaluate the label correlation based on the co-occurrence statistics of their corresponding label names. Based on the derived label correlations, we add a complementary loss to make the overall loss more robust when correlated labels were predicted by the classifier but missed by human annotators. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of FLC over state-of-the-art methods, especially when the human labels are not perfect and the training data is limited. Moreover, the computational overhead of employing FLC is negligible.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062290","label correlation;large-scale text classificstion;pmi","","","","","","","42","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quasi-continuous wave radar can get the advantages of both of them, but it still has truncation error. Pulse coding technology can circumvent this problem. In this paper, we use pulse coding technology to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduce the ambiguity and enhance the swath width of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) without changing any hardware. Firstly, we describe the principle of echo reconstruction of spaceborne SAR signal by pulse coding. Suppose each subpulse echo of the coding composition has a certain linear relationship, the echo reconstruction arithmetic of the pulse coding can be simplified, and the pulse coding's applicability can be improved in spaceborne SAR system. Then, we analyze the effect of pulse coding technology on SNR, ambiguity and image width of spaceborne SAR. The simulation results show that pulse coding technology has the same effect on improving the SNR of spaceborne SAR as broadening the width of a single pulse. The Doppler phase difference between each sub-pulse of the coding group will cause the reconstruction error of the pulse coding echo, which changes with the azimuth position, resulting in the final system SNR improvement effect being slightly lower than the theoretical analysis results. Finally, the 2D image simulation results verify the effectiveness of the pulse coding technology in spaceborne SAR system and the correctness for the impact analysis of SNR.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062106","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062106","pulse coding technology;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);high-resolution wide swath (HRWS);miniaturized radar","","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider an extended AND protocol that extends the usual AND operations with two input choices, 0 and 1, to allow the input of a third value, “indefinite,” which is neither 0 nor 1. Considering the continuity of the protocols, it is better to design them to satisfy the transitivity law, and in practice, we need to deal with the classification of three-element semigroups. We attempted a complete classification with restrictions to have a local AND structure, and found that except for trivial examples and considerations of the algebraic isomorphism, we could reduce the classification to only seven cases. These include cases of three-valued logics by Bochvar and Lukasiewicz respectively. We also discuss how to implement card-based protocols to realize these three-element semigroups, but the usual encoding rule of the previous works is not applied to select one value from three candidates.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning, and its learning process progresses through interactions between environments and agents. In this process, the reward function obtains rewards and performs actions to obtain them. A poorly designed reward function does not provide appropriate, valuable feedback and causes inefficient learning.

At present, most studies set the reserve demand of the load as 6% of the load value at that time. As an important part of the modern distribution network, the power supply department can adjust the power supply of the flexible load according to the prior contract agreement. In this paper, the flexible load is taken to optimize the island range. Based on the improved LSTM neural network, the confidence level and the influence of different types of flexible loads on islanding are solved. It is concluded that the islanding reserve demand varies with the output and confidence level of intermittent power sources. The islanding stability and economic demand under different confidence levels can be balanced by adjusting the flexible load. The equivalent value of islanding restoration can be effectively increased. Compared with the post-fault power supply restoration without considering the islanding reserve demand, the proposed strategy improves the reliability of the power supply, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The experimental evaluation results verify that the improved LSTM neural network has better classification performance, and its classification accuracy index has stronger adaptability and anti-interference in the experiment. Besides, it has a good classification effect in the task of fault type and fault feeder identification of the photovoltaic distribution network. By balancing the power supply stability and demand under different confidence levels for the regulation model, and effectively increasing the value of restoration equivalence, the reliability of power supply is improved, which is more practical.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062184","Distribution network;Supply stability;Neural network;Flexible load model","","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a promising approach that offers a productive environment and creates a high-efficient program. However, DSLs lack portability and make developers incur high costs. An Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) based platform for building DSL processing systems is proposed to solve the problem. By combining reusable aspect modules, DSL processing systems can be built into each HPC system to assist developers in creating programs with various systems config-urations. The platform is achieved by putting the application programming interface into the user's kernel code and controlling the kernel's execution according to the platform conventions. However, the platform has some problems. It is impossible to perform optimization that intervenes in the kernel code. It is also impossible to use SIMD and GPGPU efficiently. This study proposes a modification of the kernel code by introducing a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation system into the platform and using SIMD and GPGPU. We also created benchmarks and confirmed a performance improvement of 94 % for reducing the execution time compared with the based platform and an improvement of 9% compared with handwritten code for auto compiler optimization.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062797","Domain-Specific Language;Aspect-Oriented Programming;High-Performance Computing;Just-In-Time Compiler","Program processors;Codes;Costs;High performance computing;Optimization methods;Programming;DSL","","","","","","8","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The additional taxi-out time is a direct reflection of airport congestion and an important indicator for taxiing efficiency assessment. An accurate definition of the unimpeded taxi-out time is the basis for calculating the additional taxi-out time. For the assessment of aircraft unimpeded taxi-out time, this paper firstly conducted an analysis of the factors influencing aircraft taxi-out time; then, for busy airports using apron control, the aircraft taxi-out process was divided into two stages: apron tower control range taxiing and ATC tower control range taxiing, and a linear regression model was established for each stage using different indicators, and a new algorithm was used to calculate the aircraft unimpeded taxi-out time. Finally, the new algorithm is validated by using some aircraft parking position at Shenzhen Baoan International Airport as the object of analysis.

However, machine learning based methods have a disadvantage of requiring training time. Therefore, we use a lightweight machine learning algorithm, OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine), to reduce the training time in this paper.

The use of FPGAs draws attention to achieving more power efficiency because the users can design their application-specific custom accelerator. The hybrid approach with GPUs and FPGAs is also a hopeful solution. Still the data transfer between FPGA and GPU is a significant bottleneck because there is no native support for direct FPGA-GPU DMA transfers. This paper shows the implementation and evaluation of two direct FPGA-GPU data transfer methods. By mapping FPGA memory on the BAR address space, the GPU's DMA gained only 300 MB/s, which was slower than indirect transfer through the host's main memory. The second method maps GPU memory on the BAR address space by NVIDIA GPUDirect API, and the FPGA's DMA initiates data transfer. Although GPU-to-FPGA data transfer is not still succeeded with this method, the FPGA-to-GPU bandwidth on the Gen3 x4 bus reached 3.25 GB/s: more than 80% of peak bandwidth. This result outperformed FPGA-Host-GPU transfer by 1.6x, even faster than Host-GPU DMA transfer. Since the second method is implemented by a small extension on Xilinx's XDMA driver, it is expected to be portable for other FPGA DMA controllers.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062662","GPUDirect API;XDMA;PCIe-AXI Bridge;BAR","Conferences;Graphics processing units;Bandwidth;Data transfer;Field programmable gate arrays;Bars","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There exist $k$ agents with unique identifiers (IDs) in the network, and $f$ of them are weakly Byzantine agents, which behave arbitrarily except falsifying their identifiers. The agents behave in synchronous rounds, and each node does not have any memory like a whiteboard. In the literature, two algorithms for solving the gathering problem have been proposed. The first algorithm assumes that the number $n$ of nodes is given to agents and achieves the gathering in $O(n^{4}\cdot\vert \Lambda_{good}\vert \cdot\ X(n))$ rounds, where $\vert \Lambda_{good}\vert$ is the length of the largest ID among non-Byzantine agents, and $X(n)$ is the number of rounds required to explore any network composed of $n$ nodes. The second algorithm assumes that the upper bound $N$ of $n$ is given to agents and at least $4f^{2}+8f+4$ non-Byzantine agents exist, and achieves the gathering in $O((f+\vert \Lambda_{good}\vert)\cdot X(N))$ rounds. Both the algorithms allow agents to start gathering at different times. The first algorithm can terminate agents simultaneously, while the second one not. In this paper, we seek an algorithm that solves the gathering problem efficiently with the intermediate number of non-Byzantine agents since there is a large gap between the numbers of non-Byzantine agents in the previous works. The resultant gathering algorithm works with at least $8f+8$ non-Byzantine agents when agents start the algorithm at the same time, agents may terminate at different times, and $N$ is given to agents. To reduce the number of agents, we propose a new technique to simulate a Byzantine consensus algorithm for synchronous message-passing systems on agent systems. The proposed algorithm achieves the gathering in $o(f\cdot\vert \Lambda_{good}\vert \cdot X(N))$ rounds. This algorithm is faster than the first existing algorithm and requires fewer non-Byzantine agents than the second existing algorithm if $n$ is given to agents, although the guarantees on simultaneous termination and startup delay are not the same.","2832-1324","978-1-6654-7532-7","10.1109/CANDARW57323.2022.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062625","Distributed algorithms;Byzantine environments;Gathering","Upper bound;Conferences;Consensus algorithm;Delays;Behavioral sciences;Reliability;Time complexity","","","","","","13","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the related research didn’t take full advantage of the dependency relations between words, the interaction between the node and its corresponding dependency relations is not taken into consideration, which causes the aspect words mistakenly focus on other context word. To solve these problems, a graph attention network model with relational sequence encoding (RSE-GAT) is proposed in this paper. The model constructs an aspect-rooted syntactic dependency tree, which constructs the representation of virtual connections and relation between aspect words and other words by dependency sequence encoding. At the same time, the composition operator is applied to enhance the interaction between word embedding and relation embedding. Finally, GAT is utilized for feature extraction. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed RSE-GAT model achieves better results. Compared with the classical GCN-based model ASGCN[5], the accuracy on RES14, LAP14[9] and Twitter[10] is increased by 3.05%, 2.05% and 3.68% respectively.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062022","aspect-based sentiment analysis;syntactic dependence;Graph Convolutional Network (GCN);attention mechanism","Sentiment analysis;Technological innovation;Analytical models;Syntactics;Feature extraction;Encoding;Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network recommendation model based on neighbor item awareness. The model designs a session-aware encoder that efficiently aggregates neighbor item information with the help of global session information, and achieves session information enhancement while reducing the introduction of noise. Specifically, NA-GNN constructs a global session graph and a current session graph to model the influence of neighboring items on items and sessions: (1) Global session graph, by creating links to related items in all sessions and constructing root-mean-square-valued session perceptrons to explore the influence of neighboring sessions on items, and finally fusing out session representations of neighboring item features. (2) Current session graph, exploring item embedding by modeling pairwise item transitions in the current session. And, in this paper, we fuse the session representation with neighboring item information and the current session representation through an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","","979-8-3503-4657-2","10.1109/CMAEE58250.2022.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066059","Recommender systems;Session-based recommendation;Graph networks","","","","","","","23","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, unlike the path planning of mobile robots, which only needs to consider the path collision, the mechanical arm belongs to a series robot, and the links are clamped to each other, which directly affects the pose of the end effector through the change of the joint angle, so it is relatively more complicated to consider the rod collision.

Then the random value is generated by using the Bernoulli matrix, which is used to construct the global sparse measurement matrix. Finally, the cluster head receives the measurement value and the Bernoulli random value from the child node, and the compression observation is carried out by the sink node.

The traditional compensation method based on the regression model has limited accuracy for the complex atmospheric environment due to few parameters and low order. With the idea of using plane instead of surface locally in surface integral, we propose a high-precision AP compensation method: Firstly, the atmospheric phase surface (APS) is divided into several sub-regions by using the spatially constrained normal vector (SCNV). Then, a three-dimensional plane is used to approximate a surface to obtain the estimation result of the APS in the subregion.

Furthermore, the energy consumption model of computing task offloading is obtained through the time delay model, and then the cost function of computing task offloading is constructed in combination with the load balancing degree and energy consumption. With the task offloading strategy, the minimum cost of task offloading is obtained under the multiple constraints, and the path of computing task offloading is determined. The simulation results demonstrate that the strategy can significantly improve the load balancing of the edge server and the overall performance of the edge server.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062173","Edge computing;Task offloading;Time delay;Energy consumption;Load balancing degree","Energy consumption;Technological innovation;Costs;Computational modeling;Simulation;Load management;Servers","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present study established a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model in ANSYS FLUENT, for analyzing aerodynamic performance of full- scale horizontal axis wind turbine subject to extreme operating gust condition. The effects of extreme operating gust on low-speed shaft torque, angle of attack and lift/drag coefficients are investigated. The results show that in the extreme operating gust condition, if the value of upstream wind velocity exceeds the rated wind velocity, a significantly discrepancy of the low-speed shaft torque is shown during the process of wind velocity increasing and decreasing. The presence of extreme operating gust affects the sectional angle of attack, and variation continuously of angle of attack leads to the hysteresis of aerodynamic loads, leading to a dynamic stall phenomenon consequently.

This paper selects Ningxia, a western region with deep poverty, as the study area, establishes the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLA) multidimensional poverty indicator system, extracts the Total Night Light Index (TNL) and the Average Night Light Index (ANL) based on night light remote sensing images, and uses them to construct a night light poverty index model, analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of Ningxia's poor counties, and conduct an in-depth probe into the influencing factors of poverty in Ningxia. The analysis of the results shows that in the Ningxia region, the nighttime light poverty model (MPITNL) constructed using the total nighttime light index (TNL) is better, with an R2 of 0.792 for the MPITNL model and an average relative error of 16.07%. Based on the poverty index fitted by MPITNL, a grading of poverty was carried out at the county level scale, and it was found that the poverty level in Ningxia deepened from the north to the south, with the south-central part of Ningxia being the region most vulnerable to poverty, with the six main influencing factors being altitude, per capita disposable income of urban residents, per capita disposable income of rural residents, the proportion of employed workers, urbanization rate, and investment in fixed assets. Finally, a two-factor interaction detection between the main factors was carried out using a geographic probe, in which the interaction between the share of employed workers and fixed asset investment had the greatest explanatory power, and the combined effect of these two factors had the most significant impact on the divergence of poor counties in Ningxia, where the resource allocation of social capital and human capital influenced the economic development of Ningxia.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10061905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061905","Luminous Remote Sensing;NPP-VIIRS;Multidimensional poverty;Poverty Index","","","","","","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, only hundreds of thousands of people in China have revived formal sign language training. Therefore, for hearing-impaired people, how to communicate with ordinary people becomes a problem. Some articles have looked at converting sign language into text or audio. However, very few articles have dealt with how to help hearing-impaired people understand what ordinary people say. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method to convert audio into sign language video and play it on the web page. The main idea is to build a database based on Chinese common sign language and collect audio through computer microphones. After that, this method uses the Chinese word segmentation method of HanLP to segment words, and the obtained phrases are processed and matched with the database. After obtaining the database output, the videos are sorted and spliced by matching the original phrase list. Eventually, the stitched video will be played on the web. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this method is 90%.

It is a challenging task for path planning in open world environments, especially those having multiple dynamic obstacles with time-varying moving speed. In this context, safety become the key performance indicator, resulting in most of global path planning algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT*, etc) no longer in force due to their inadequate adaptability to dynamic environments. Therefore, we propose in this paper a novel safety-aware RRT* algorithm for the path planning of mobile robots in open world environments with dynamic obstacles. We leverage the safety-field model (firstly developed for self-driving cars with constrained path, i.e. vehicle lane) to mobile robot path planning (with unconstrained moving routes in the working space in general). In particular, a fine-grained energy map is developed as a safety indicator illustrating the real-time risk to the working space caused by dynamic obstacles in terms of distance away from the robot (which presents the potential energy), moving direction and moving speed (which present the kinetic energy). This is in strong contrast to the artificial potential field model that is widely utilized in the obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, which only considers the potential energy and provides a coarse risk indication to robots. In order to improve the efficiency of the proposed safety-aware RRT* algorithm, we further propose a pruning strategy for the sampling process of RRT* based on the fine-grained energy map to guide the rapidly-exploring random tree growing in a safe direction. The parent node re-selection and rewiring process of the proposed algorithm also incorporates the safety-field based energy map. Experimental results show that the proposed safety-aware RRT* algorithm can provide excellent safety and efficiency in dynamic environments.","","979-8-3503-4657-2","10.1109/CMAEE58250.2022.00035","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071083,U1908214); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT21GJ208,DUT21TD107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066075","path planning;mobile robot;RRT*;safety field","","","","","","","21","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the backbone grid should meet both the constraints of normal operating state and the secure operating constraints under disasters. Meanwhile, the model adopts ""virtual flow"" to ensure the connectivity of the backbone grid. The method of inequality constraint separation is used to convert the model into a 0-1 mixed integer linear programming model. The validity of the proposed model and algorithm is verified through simulation tests in IEEE 118 bus system.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062223","transmission grid planning;transmission grid against disasters;backbone grid;planning cost;topology connectivity","Technological innovation;Power transmission lines;Costs;Design standards;Power grids;Planning;Mixed integer linear programming","","","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was recently shown that generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm has good effect in dealing with the problem of nonlinear distortion of the clipped OFDM signal, but it will also lead to the reduction of signal spectrum utilization.

Specifically, we define the inter-block correlation and calculate the inter-block correlation of each block from the initial measurement. By exploiting these inter-block correlations, more measurements are allocated to texture regions in the original frame, while fewer measurements are allocated to smooth regions.

However, the traditional command and control system based on middleware only divides a number of partitions according to the scale of command and control software, without considering the operating characteristics of each component of command and control software, resulting in insufficient or excessive allocation of hardware resources. At the same time, each command and control partition adopts different parsing protocols, and needs to build additional data format conversion modules, which increases the workload of building command and control system. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a command and control partition architecture adapted to the communication middleware. Compared with the original single partition mode, the architecture divides a number of independent partition for the components of a single command and control software. , which avoids the problem that the performance of command and control software is reduced due to unreasonable partitions. To solve the problem of different command and control software parsing protocols, a unified access platform (UAP) for heterogeneous protocols is designed. Compared with the traditional middleware, UAP has the ability of unifying the format between external protocol data and internal topic data, which solves the problem of unifying the format of information transmission in each partition of the command and control system. Finally, from three aspects of delay characteristics, throughput characteristics and packet loss rate, the command and control partition system based on the unified access platform is experimentally verified. The results show that under the distributed heterogeneous partition environment, the command and control partition system based on the unified access platform supports the access of multiple protocol programs, and has the performance requirements of the command and control system.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10062274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062274","Communication Middleware;Virtualization Technology;Command and control System","Command and control systems;Technological innovation;Protocols;Architecture;Packet loss;Computer architecture;Throughput","","","","","","13","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, the sales of green energy cars, under the great support of funds and discounts offered by the Chinese Government, had flown sky high in China's urban areas. Channels of charging if these green vehicles vary from situations, the most common types being static, dynamic, and quasi-dynamic wireless charging. Compared to wired charging, these techniques surpass it in ways of easier access, safety, and durability. Many wireless transmitters expose body parts that get easily damaged due to environmental factors. As the transmission is wireless, the device can be charged at a far wider range of angles and positions in which the wired chargers can never succeed. However, current wireless transmissions still faced technical barriers such as low charging speed and expensive installation. Furthermore, in contrast to the rapidly increasing market demands, the population of charging poles and pads provided a great difficulty for cars to maneuver themselves into parking spaces while aligning with transmission devices. Based on these issues, I successfully fabricated an automated alignment system based on computer-driven kinematic models to help solve such an issue. This study aims at analyzing possible solutions to this problem and why this system outperforms than other computational methods to deduct difficulty for drivers when parking with their green energy vehicles.

The currently common approach to LCD is based on a bag-of-words (BoW) and traditional manually designed features. However, The BoW-based method ignores the spatial location information and semantic information of visual features, and image aliasing will affect the detection accuracy of the algorithm. Meanwhile, the artificially designed features are very sensitive to light changes.

However, as the passenger flow and traffic conditions change over time, it is difficult for bus schedules to respond in time. Therefore, it is meaningful to conduct real-time bus dispatching according to the current passenger flow and traffic conditions to reduce bus companies' costs and improve passengers' experience. Although deep reinforcement learning has made good progress in public transport control, most relevant research has made continuous decisions on whether to dispatch in a very short time interval. In this study, we consider bus timetable optimization as a reinforcement learning problem and thoroughly consider the practical application. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to determine the next departure interval. Therefore, the bus timetable is formulated dynamically and timely to cope with changes in traffic conditions and passenger demand. Specifically, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework with a novel environment model, adding human experience to avoid learning from scratch and reconsider the step size, observation, and reward function to provide more effective information to the deep RL system.

Here, we present a system that uses frequency-based analysis of joint data from both arms and legs from a single, frontally-viewed video of people walking towards a camera. We evaluate three machine-learning models on frequency-based features extracted from the joint dynamics on two larger datasets containing a total of $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{N}=300}$ videos of over 50 PD patients and healthy control people.

In this paper, technical and economic factors are considered comprehensively. First, the optimal range of well location in fault block reservoir is determined by analyzing the distribution of remaining oil. Then, taking the net present value as the objective function and the well location as a variable, an intelligent optimization mathematical model of well location is established, and fish swarm algorithm is introduced to solve the problem to obtain the optimal well location with the maximum net present value. By comparing the development effects of intelligent optimization of well location and artificial determination of well location, the calculation shows that the recovery percent of the main layer after intelligent optimization of well location is 52.86%, while the recovery percent of the main layerafter artificial determination of well location is 51.47%, which shows that this method can reasonably select the location of infilled wells, achieve the goal of maximum profit after infilled wells, and effectively improve the reservoir recovery.","","979-8-3503-2000-8","10.1109/IAECST57965.2022.10061912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061912","fault block reservoir;well location optimization;fish swarm algorithm;ultra-high water cut stage","Economics;Technological innovation;Oils;Reservoirs;Numerical simulation;Linear programming;Fish","","","","","","9","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the current FFBs harvesting process requires a significant amount of manual labor and may cause injuries or damage to the FFBs which must be avoided to ensure the oil produced does not get affected. Therefore, an automatic harvesting system needs to be developed to help avoid such issues. An important part of the harvesting system would be a vision system for the detection and localization of the fruits and involves the usage of computer vision models. In this paper, a comparison is performed between four different models: Support Vector Machine (SVM) which uses the Histogram of Gradients (HOG), Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4 and YOLOv5. The models were tested by the metrics of mean average precision (mAP), precision, recall and F1 score and their detection speed. The results showed that the SVM + HOG model had the worst performance with a mAP of 89% and the YOLOv4 model had the best performance with a mAP of 98.5%. However, the YOLOv5 model provided the best results in terms of speed with a detection speed of 11.4 ms and its mAP was 96.4% making it the best model for use in a harvesting system for the detection of FFBs as it provides both speed and accuracy.","","979-8-3503-4657-2","10.1109/CMAEE58250.2022.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066108","Object detection;oil palm fresh fruit bunch;fruit detection;SVM;Faster RCNN;YOLO","","","","","","","28","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discussed the mechanism of the rollover accidents and proposed a simple but effective impact attenuation structure, which can be attached to the top of the cars. Quasi-static compression is performed on silicone, EVA rubber, and foam to determine the stress-strain behaviors. Dynamic free fall experiments are conducted to investigate the impact of energy absorption of the materials. A 3-D printed aluminum model is developed as a scale mode of the car cockpit during the free fall experiments. A dynamic 3-axis acceleration sensor at 2 kHz, together with a computer is used for data acquisition. The final results show that EVA rubber is the ideal material that can effectively reduce the impact of the model from >40 g to 5.5 g. Foam is insufficient in energy absorption and unable to prevent the metal model from impact with the ground even when the attenuator is fully compressed. Silicone is also found incapable of reducing the g-force to a safe range during impact due to its high elastic modulus. In the end, an impact attenuation structure made of EVA rubber for real passenger cars is suggested to effectively improve the safety of the people during a rollover accident.","","979-8-3503-4657-2","10.1109/CMAEE58250.2022.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066084","Rollover;Free-/all;impact attenuator","","","","","","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The typical framework of deep learning-based anomaly detection includes a model to predict or reconstruct the state of devices and a detection mechanism to determine anomalies. The majority of anomaly detection methods use a fixed threshold detection mechanism to detect anomalous points. However, the anomalies caused by cyberattacks in ICSs are usually continuous anomaly segments. In this paper, we propose a novel detection mechanism to detect continuous anomaly segments. Its core idea is to determine the start and end times of anomalies based on the continuity characteristics of anomalies and the dynamics of error. We conducted experiments on the two real-world datasets for performance evaluation using five baselines. The F1 score increased by 3.8% on average in the SWAT dataset and increased by 15.6% in the WADI dataset.

Initialization of offshore oil spill distribution with initial model input parameters takes into account the airflow factor based on the oil spill spreading toward the surrounding area due to its own gravity at sea. Considering evaporation, attachment, emulsification, dissolution and, shoreline attachment during oil spill dispersion, the oil spill quality of each grid is calculated in discrete time series, and the oil spill quality of different grids is color stratified by edge detection. Finally, the algorithm is integrated into the navigation simulator to simulate the process of oil spill diffusion from the initial state to the influence of the above factors.

The conclusions show that: 1) the MK-LSTM algorithm can reduce the computational complexity and the impact of noise in raw data; 2) the prediction accuracy of the proposed MK-LSTM model is better than baseline models and some parameters with low correlation (e.g., chamber earth pressure) do not significantly improve the prediction effect.

To produce a stable, sparse neural representation of the states of the tic-tac-toe board, a convolutional pre-trained neural network has been used, followed by a fully-connected sigmoidal network. The assemble behaves as a $\boldsymbol{Q}$ -matrix and produces the ultimate state-decision pairs that control a robotic arm placing physical tokens on the board. The hyperparameters in the whole network are tuned to produce a stable trainable array of elements. An internal clock composed of internal neurons is integrated to give the agent a sense of sequential timing. To solve the $\mathbf{max}(\cdot)$ function, a novel algorithm is introduced to search for the $\boldsymbol{Q}$ -network values. The algorithm uses a dedicated, sigmoidal net initialized with random parameters. Under backpropagation it iteratively moves to a stable plateau that mimics the all-zeros condition of an initial Q-matrix. Next, the agent uses Bellman's reinforcement principles to learn an optimal policy with a noticeable look-ahead capability.

For adhering to the load flow problem, a modified version of Whale Optimization Algorithm has been suggested by the authors in this paper. The algorithm is a trustworthy meta-heuristic optimization algorithm derived from nature and motivated by the humpback whale bubble-net hunting hypothesis. The accuracy and reliability has been enhanced by the introduction of chaos theory and opposition-based learning (OBL) to WOA so as to effectively cover the entire search region and thereby enhance the convergence of single or multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms. The new algorithm termed as Chaotic-Opposition based Whale Optimization (COWOA) uses the chaos theory for primary tuning of parameters of WOA by which the exploitation and exploration processes are adjusted and OBL is used to look for the solutions in reverse direction of indicated values in order to test if selects in reverse direction can provide even better solutions. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate that in discerning scenario when traditional load flow approaches flounder, COWOA is able to provide effective solutions.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059576","Whale optimization algorithm;Chaotic-Opposition based whale optimization algorithm;Steady state power;voltage stability;Load flow problem;Ill-conditioned power system","Simulation;Metaheuristics;Whales;Power system stability;Reliability theory;Whale optimization algorithms;Robustness","","","","","","19","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But large scale integration and uncoordinated charging of electric vehicles will have a negative impact on grid performance, especially during peak periods. Therefore, a coordinated control technique is required to manage EV battery charging and discharging. Many techniques, including PI control, model predictive control, adaptive control, hysteresis control, droop loop control, and fuzzy logic control, are used to address this problem. Due to the uncertainty in EV charging, fuzzy logic control is chosen over other technologies. In this research work, a novel control mechanism based on a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is developed to enhance grid performance. This controller is based on real time pricing scheme. Real time pricing (RTP), voltage deviation, and charging requirement are the FLC's inputs parameters, while the charging/discharging rate is the FLC's output parameter. The system was tested in a DC distribution system. This method is applicable to demand side energy management to the grid. RTP based controller compared with time of unit(TOU) based controller.

This work proposes a three-level boost converter as a core element connecting in a modular manner. If non-ideal devices are used and/or asymmetrical switching signals for the switches are applied, the voltage across the output capacitors might be different. It can lead to a failed operation. An equalized voltage control method with the current loop control is proposed to ensure similar capacitor voltages. The energy control is applied for the output voltage.

Nowadays, agriculture is becoming an inconsistent field; farmershave to struggle to regain their investment, forgoing their profits. A farmer in day-to-day life faces many challenges; while some are above human power, like natural calamities and fire accidents, most are solvable. One such is plant disease. Plant diseases are seasonal. Whenever there is an attack, it affects a single farm or farmer and the whole community, which propagates to the production cycle and the supply chain. This situation necessitates a foolproof and efficient diagnosis system that can automatically run inspections and identify outbreaks at early stages. In an attempt to address this issue, we propose an Autonomous bot that effectively monitors the health of the crops and identifies issues faster, even zero- day attacks. The rover-mounted leaf disease detection system runs through the produce at set intervals and checks for any abnormal patterns in the leaves prospectively caused by plant diseases. If found, the AI engine identifies the nature of the attack and notifies thefarmer appropriately. It also provides proposed remedial measures to stop the diseasespread.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059618","Plant diseases;AI engine;Rover;Autonomous bot","Plant diseases;Renewable energy sources;Supply chains;Production;Chatbots;Agriculture;Reliability","","","","","","5","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An electromagnetic bearing (EMB) supports the rotors of machines through controlled magnetic forces. Due to their non-contact and lubrication-free operation, EMBs are becoming an attractive solution for high-speed and clean applications. These EMBs are inherently unstable systems and require closed-loop control for stabilization. The unstable pole constrains the achievable control specifications such as gain margin, phase margin and bandwidth. The controller design that ensures stability margins as required is critical. This paper reviews the simplified modelling of the EMB system, P and PD controllers design and their drawbacks in stabilizing the EMB. The relation between the stability margins and the unstable pole is analyzed using Bode's gain-phase relation. A systematic PID controller design procedure that ensures the required stability margins is presented. The simulation results comparing P, PD, and PID controllers are presented. Further, the performance of the PID controller is validated on a nonlinear model.

The Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) database allows for the estimation of the residential load of about 200 households at the Residential Charging Parking Station (RCPS). The modeling of the arrival of EVs at the parking lot is done with a truncated Gaussian distribution. Incorporating Battery Charging Characteristics approximates the instantaneous charging time of each Electric Vehicle. In addition, the rising charging demand for electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates using renewable energy sources to reduce the negative impacts on the distribution system.

But the penetration of such power sources from the distribution side should also ensure the stability of the existing power system. This paper investigates the voltage stability of a power system with participation of EVs in grid scheduling. A cost model of battery of EV to schedule the available active and reactive power is proposed.

Due to this high complexity that exists when provisioning test environments within the multiple available cloud platforms, it is necessary to make a significant investment in human resources, like time and effort for the implementation and execution of testing. There is additional complexity: testing software in a single environment is no longer sufficient. Today's mobile industry is constantly growing, and execution environments tend to be always different; the hardware configuration is usually different and sometimes exceeds the software barrier. It is challenging to execute testing on each of the existing devices, as this requires a long task of human intervention. Today some platforms provide testing services in different environments. However, not all providers have the complete set of environments that one would like to have, and specific knowledge is mandatory for using each available tool. It is a task that requires expertise and time. This work seeks to mitigate the impact on time and the learning curve through a high-level tool developed using a model-oriented approach, thus reducing the time needed for setting up each required platform for organizations. As a solution, we propose a Domain-Specific Language for provisioning multiple cloud testing environments for mobile applications. The configuration of the environment is done with the Domain Specific Language to make the usage easier by the final user. The necessary code is generated through transformations to set up an environment on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This usage of this platform results in fewer code lines written and less time learning about the specific knowledge for each platform.","","978-1-6654-5517-6","10.1109/ICI2ST57350.2022.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063766","DSL;testing;DevOPS;cloud;mobile","Industries;Codes;Web services;Software;Mobile applications;Complexity theory;Task analysis","","","","","","18","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Less power factor gives less efficiency and less utilization of electric machines power. We need the power factor value close to unity to get higher efficiency. A power factor correction system can improve the power factor value and maintain it close to the unity power factor using various compensation methods. In this system, we used a current and voltage transformer as input, two Zero detection circuits to determine the zero crossing point of voltage and current signal, and an Arduino UNO to control the power factor measurement, compensate and show the output. We also used inductive and resistive load in this system as load. To compensate for the power factor problem, we used a capacitor bank with a relay module, which gives leading capacitive KVAR to cancel the lagging inductive KVAR of the system due to lagging loads.

Once the overheating problem occurs, the generator will lose its magnetic field and burn down seriously. Therefore, it is very important to study the ventilation and thermal characteristics of the large generator. In this paper, an omnidirectional ventilation and cooling system with bevel arrangement of inlet and outlet is proposed by taking the 5MW direct-driven permanent magnet wind generator as an example. According to the structure and parameters of the prototype, a calculation method of coupling the generator global ventilation network model and 1/16 local fluid-heat transfer numerical model is proposed. Firstly, the global area ventilation network model of the rotating generator is established, and the operating point of the unit ventilation system is calculated. Secondly, a 3-D fluid and heat transfer coupling model of the generator in the full axial direction and 1/16 of the circumference is established. Based on the calculation results of the ventilation network, the temperature field of the 3-D local model is solved, and the accuracy of the calculation method is verified by tests. Finally, the temperature variations of the key components of the stator and rotor of the generator under different operating points of the internal ventilation system such as air volume and inlet air temperature are studied, which provides a theoretical basis for further improving the ventilation design of large offshore wind turbine generators.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059486","wind turbine generator;ventilation and cooling system;ventilation network;temperature field","Couplings;Temperature distribution;Atmospheric modeling;Rotors;Stators;Ventilation;Generators","","","","","","14","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence four alternative implementations using micro-strip PCB structures to meet desired specifications have been studied here. The first structure provides two passbands using microstrip lines, rectangular resonators and Stepped Impedance Resonator (SIR). The upper band of the suggested filter can be tuned without increasing the circuit size, which is one of its most remarkable advantages. In the second structure designed, microstrip antennas of square geometry are extended into a BPF. The third structure is a filter design based on parallel-coupled lines connected to transmission lines. The fourth structure is BPF implemented using a new and simple Defected Ground Structure (DGS). The asymmetric single S-shaped DGS is used to obtain the dual-band filter response. The structure is relatively much simpler than other DGSs that are presently used to obtain dual-band response. The analysis of these cost-effective designs show characteristics matching the SAW filter counterpart, exhibiting compact size, low insertion loss, sharp transition bands and high attenuation level in the stop-bands.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059596","","Band-pass filters;Radio frequency;Microstrip filters;Resonator filters;Dual band;SAW filters;Microstrip antennas","","","","","","13","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on these issues, several single-phase grid-integrated inverter configurations are developed and reviewed. Compared to single-phase inverter topologies, there are very few studies on three-phase inverter topologies.

Given the nature of water-based transportation being different from that of land transportation, being stranded at sea poses different challenges than being stranded on land. As electrically propelled boats grow in popularity, systems that monitor the remaining energy capacity of the batteries used in such boats and the remaining capable travel range of the said vessels become increasingly important.

The ease of manipulating digital images has made image forgery a common worry. The volume of altered photos shared daily has greatly increased due to the quick development of commercial image altering programs like Adobe Photoshop. This phenomenon has detrimental effects, diminishing reliability and producing false beliefs in many real-world applications. This paper suggests a deep learning strategy for detecting copy-move forgeries in digital images. Here, we employ two deep learning models to identify copy move fraud in digital photos, namely Buster Net and Alteration Trace Net.

The bifacial module produces more power than a traditional PV module. The PV system's output varies daily depending on temperature and irradiance levels. In order to increase the effectiveness of the PV modules, it is desirable to extract the maximum power possible. The MPPT enables the PV system to function effectively under different environmental conditions. To attain maximum power, a variety of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms are adapted using various converter topologies. The conventional Perturb and Observe approach for tracking the bifacial PV module's maximum power point is presented in this research. The P&O approach is well-known, simple to use, and doesn't require any prior understanding of the features of the PV system. This literature aims to study the performance of the P&O MPPT method for a bifacial panel using MATLAB/Simulink.

As a result, a big problem is split into two nodes or subproblems, one for numbers and one for letters. Then, letters are divided into two nodes representing the straight and curved ones. The division can be called the binary decision tree and allows to obtain a subset with the minimal features of each node called reduct. Here, an improvement of reducts is proposed using the ant colony algorithm as the embedded method. The application of these methods had the following result and conclusions. For each node, subsets of fewer features were obtained with high performance in the classification, considering the morphology of each letter.

In the electrically assisted turbocharger, the electrical machine operates in more challenging conditions where the ambient temperature is between 200°C and 300°C. This makes the development of high-temperature, high-performance machines is not only a safety issue but also a performance issue. Therefore, the impact of these high temperatures on the electromagnetic and mechanical performances of a high-speed permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) intended for use in turbochargers is the subject of this study. Firstly, the changes in the electromagnetic and mechanical characteristics of the materials used in the SPM machine due to temperature variation are discussed. Moreover, finite element analysis (FEA) is used to make accurate predictions and comparisons about the electromagnetic performance of the PMSM running at 20°C and 200°C, including the airgap flux density, no-load voltage, output torque, torque-speed characteristics, electromagnetic losses and efficiency, and rotor mechanical stress. Finally, an individual design parameter optimization is carried out at 20°C and 200°C to highlight the influence of high temperatures on the predicted optimum values.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059503","SPM machine;Performance analysis;FEA;High speed;High temperature","Permanent magnet machines;Temperature;Torque;Rotors;Magnetic losses;Steel;Electromagnetics","","","","","","16","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quarantined subjects were monitored manually, and patients tended to abscond or “run away.” In the Philippines, there was a lack of research and the absence of similar technology commercially available related to this matter. Project Bantay integrated Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), indoor positioning systems, and wearable technology to alleviate the shortage of personnel, long-term savings on workforce utilization in the government, and predict absconding or “run-away” potentially infectious individuals in our current and future quarantine facilities. Also, it included information system development for monitoring quarantined subjects' heart rates and temperatures that would eventually help the government combat and prepare for a similar unexpected pandemic. The prototype would start by turning on the device after being placed on the quarantined subject. The device must be linked to the router, and the sensors must then be calibrated. The web interface should receive and be able to see data readings, including temperature, heart rate, the location of the subject being quarantined, and the removal of the device via an IR reading. The temperature, heart rate sensor, and indoor positioning all measured above a p-value of 0.05, which accepted the null hypothesis, confirming that the actual and commercial product versus Project Bantay's temperature, heart rate, and indoor positioning accuracy was statistically the same. The anti-absconding tendencies of the hypothetical dataset using machine learning data analytics showed that among four inherently multioutput machine learning regression algorithms, the Decision Tree Regression Algorithm could output a much better result in determining the tendencies of a subject to abscond from the quarantine facility.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059471","COVID-19;ESP32;IoT;machine learning;wearable technology","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Heart rate;COVID-19;Temperature distribution;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning","","","","","","6","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently more and more distributed energy sources are tied to the grid injecting active power. But the reactive power requirement is still high which can cause grid instability. According to some recent codes PV inverters have to inject reactive power into utility for the grid support. This paper is focusing on reactive power injection along with active power injection.

The two-stage inverter topology consists of a dc-dc boost converter stage used to increase the wide range of input voltage while lowering the inverter's needed kilovolt ampere rating. Furthermore, it acts as the MPPT block for maximum power tracking. The NPC inverter was used as the inverter which kept the common-mode voltage constant and result in a low leakage current.

Now a days PMSM is preferred over induction motor due to its simple structure, higher power density, higher efficiency, and higher torque to inertia ratio. In order to have an accurate and dynamic control of PMSM, rotor position must be sensed using an encoder or a resolver. However, using sensors increases the complexity and cost of the system as the sensors are accompanied by power conditioning circuits, wires, etc. Hence, sensorless speed control of PMSM is a need of time. Modern observers, and estimators are being researched worldwide. Major estimators for PMSM are either based on back emf estimation or signal injection. These algorithms are very complicated and are sensitive to disturbances and parameter variations. Hence, a robust, Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) is most suited in this case. It has added advantage of simplicity in implementation and guaranteed stability. However, due to discontinuous feature of SMO, chattering is the major issue with it. Higher-Order Sliding Mode Observer (HOSMO) is adopted for mitigating the chattering effects of SMO. In this work, HOSMO for PMSM is designed. It is shown that the HOSMO yields a finite-time smooth estimation of the rotor angle. The stability of the HOSMO is investigated using the Lyapunov function.

Improvements in prediction models help the wind generation systems to operate efficiently. The accumulation of errors in the multi-step prediction creates a challenge in formulating novel prediction models.

This article suggests the CMPN-LMSRE-based HAFA because of its quick convergence, low computing load, and straightforward construction. Through quick convergence velocity, the proposed HAFA adjusts the gains of all proportional-integral (PI) controllers. Under the cascaded arrangement, four PI controllers are used in the rotor side converter (RSC), and four more are used in the grid side converter (GSC). The RSC is regulated by cascaded structure-based PI controllers to limit generator power loss and enhance power production. In contrast, GSC is controlled to preserve the grid side reactive power and dc-link voltage. By contrasting the outcomes of the proposed CMPN-LMSRE-based PI controllers with those of CMPN-based and LMSRE-based PI controllers during severe grid disturbances, the validity of the proposed CMPN-LMSRE-based PI controllers is confirmed. The MATLAB application is used to carry out the LVRT capability.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059617","Hybrid adaptive filtering algorithm (HAFA);PI;LVRT;DFIG;WECS","Transient response;PI control;Doubly fed induction generators;Rotors;Filtering algorithms;Hybrid power systems;Topology","","","","","","13","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) have proven to be efficient in providing controllability to reactive power for voltage stability management. However, the performance of the FACTs devices largely depends on the installation location. A fuzzy logic technique for finding the optimal location for the Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) and Static Var Compensator (SVC) FACTS devices with specific security indices is proposed in this paper. The proposed indices for SVC placement are the Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) and critical voltage, while the considered indices for TCSC placement are the loss sensitivity factor (LSF) and line stability index (LSI). The indices are fuzzified to obtain a suitability index which determines the suitable line(s) and node(s) accordingly. The proposed approach is implemented on the IEEE 30 bus network. The SVC reduced the overall transmission loss by 1.6%, while the TCSC reduced the transmission loss by 4.94 %. The loading margin also improved by 24.87% and 2.92% using SVC and TCSC, respectively. The voltage profile also remained close to 1 p.u under varying load conditions. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed technique at reducing transmission loss, improving voltage stability and improving voltage profile simultaneously.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059554","Distribution Network;Fuzzy Expert System;Flexible AC Transmission Devices;Optimal Placement","Thyristors;Reactive power;Sensitivity;Stability criteria;Loading;Static VAr compensators;Power system stability","","","","","","17","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method controls the receiver side converter (RSC) to maintain the output power by controlling the phase-shift angle (ß). Further, the system efficiency is enhanced by maintaining the system at its optimal operating point by achieving zero power factor angle (ZPA). The ZPA condition is achieved by controlling the transmitter side converter (TSC) phase shift angle (α) to make the input reactive power ($Q_{in}$) equal to zero. The proposed control technique is implemented on a 1 kW series-series (S-S) compensated BWPT laboratory prototype.

In this paper, the effect of perturbation step size of MPPT algorithm on different MPPT performance factors like tracking speed, efficiency and interharmonics is studied. Usually, a compromise is to be made between these factors while choosing step size. In this paper, P & O algorithm with two fixed step sizes, an adaptive step size P & O algorithm and a hybrid P & O algorithm is proposed to reduce interharmonics generated from MPPT. The algorithms are simulated in MATLAB and results are compared with conventional fixed step size P & O algorithm with small as well as big perturbation step size.

Solar PV-based power generation plays a dominant role in RESs, as it is easily accessible and requires less maintenance. Since Solar PV has limitations due to atmospheric conditions such as insolation and temperature. As a consequence, to overcome the non-linearity restriction of solar PV, MPPT controllers are extensively used to enhance the maximum power output. The MPPT controller delivers the relevant switch pulse to the dc-dc converter to obtain the maximum power and regulated output across the DC link. In this configuration, the passive elements and dc-dc converters are designed using mathematical modeling based on the switching mode operation of switches.

The main problem is the large number of coefficients required to simulate high-quality BRIRs, even in low-reverberant environments. In this sense, an approach that reconstructs a BRIR with fewer computational resources has been a challenge until nowadays. Therefore, this work introduces an approach for generating BRIRs from a compressed BRIR representation using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The approach consists of 1) simulating a certain number of BRIRs using an acoustic simulator software for a given virtual environment; 2) generating a dataset with enough BRIRs distributed uniformly over the given scenario using a data augmentation process; 3) applying a clusterization technique to homogenize the BRIR dataset previous training process; 4) training a VAE to obtain dimensionally reduced BRIRs from the encoder; 5) finally, generating a BRIR from the compressed representation using the decoder of the VAE. Only a segment of the BRIR was used to train and evaluate this approach. The MSE between the BRIRs simulated and the BRIRs generated by the model were compared to test the results, presenting a lower MSE.","","978-1-6654-5517-6","10.1109/ICI2ST57350.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063775","Real-time aurilization;Acoustic Virtual Reality;Variational Auto-encoders;Room-Impulse Responses","Training;Deep learning;Solid modeling;Virtual environments;Software;Real-time systems;Acoustics","","","","","","18","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Algal bloom cause severe damage to the marine habitat. They deplete the dissolved oxygen which leads to hypoxic conditions in the water. So, eventually the species living under the water suffocates todeath. Some of the algae can even produce toxins which are harmful to both marine life forms and also to higher forms of life. Cleaning up a highly eutrophic polluted lake is a tedious process and expensive. So, Eutrophication should be identified at the beginning stage itself and proper steps should be taken to prevent further damage. This project proposes a monitoring system which is intended to serve as a network of sensor nodes in stationary water bodies such as lakes for the purpose of predicting and detecting the possibility and severity of Eutrophication through a functional modular system. The basic structure used for each node will be buoy. The buoys will be anchored, and hence a strategic deployment of these monitoring buoys over a lake will allow for localization of the source data collecting regions. Each sensor node will be given a Unique Identifier (UID). For monitoring the water, each node will be equipped with various sensors. A temperature sensor will be placed on the surface level. These sensors are controlled by micro-controllers on each node. LoRa wireless communication will be used to transmit the collected data. A LoRa WAN receiver connected to a processor will process and upload these data to the database accordingly. Critical end user data includes monitoring the sensor nodes and water quality detected from each node. Alerts are sent to the concerned user when the data collected favours Eutrophication so that it can be prevented in an early stage.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059562","Eutrophication;Sensors;LoRa WAN","Wide area networks;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Temperature measurement;Water quality;Lakes;Water pollution","","","","","","7","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the existing character recognition studies for Handwritten Tamil scripts have relied upon the widely used Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in spite of its familiar shortcomings and few reported in ANN. Though character recognition from the images of inscribed documents is challenging because of the complex character structure of the Tamil language scripts and other artifacts like aging and degradation, modern techniques needs to be developed to digitize such inscriptions and preserves them as electronic documents. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for recognizing the inscription characters from the ancient Tamil stone inscriptions based on two recently developed models of Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Camera captured stone inscriptions script images are taken as input and enhanced for clarity through various image enhancement techniques like filtering, luminous, erosion, dilation and blurring. Project profile based character segmentation is done for extracting individual characters out of script image. Over segmentation reduction is done for eliminating touching and broken characters. The character recognition is done in twofold. (i) Recognition of single characters (vowels and consonants) using Convolutional Neural Network (ii) Recognition of compound characters using Recurrent Neural Networks-BLSTM model. A meticulous test on large datasets has been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN based system achieved training accuracy of 88% and validation accuracy of 94% is obtained (Included RNN accuracy). The system performance is evaluated on various test cases in each phase and the limitations have been identified.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059489","Ancient Tamil;Stone Inscription;Character Segmentation;Character Recognition;Handwritten characters;Convolutional Neural Network;LSTM","Training;Image segmentation;Renewable energy sources;Recurrent neural networks;System performance;Optical character recognition;Hidden Markov models","","","","","","19","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is difficult to obtain the internal junction temperature of SiC modules in real time, limited by sensors and testing methods. The junction temperature estimation based on the thermal network model combined with an integrated negative thermal coefficient (NTC) thermistor is an effective evaluation method. The existing thermal network models omit effects of the solder layer fatigue aging due to thermal stress, resulting in junction temperature estimation error. In this paper, a junction temperature estimation method is proposed, which establish the relationship between NTC sensor temperature and the thermal resistances of chip solder layer and bottom layer. The junction temperature and NTC sensor temperature of the SiC module is expressed using the equation of state analysis to obtain a discrete-time system of temperature.

For motoring and regenerative braking mode, single-pulse control (SPC) is utilized to reduce the switching frequency to fundamental value giving the advantage of re-duced switching losses and core losses. To reduce the torque ripple and improve the efficiency of the drive, modifications in the conventional SPC are incorporated and presented. In the proposed SRM drive, the Cuk converter is utilized as a front-end converter to provide a higher demagnetization voltage, eliminating negative torque production and hence improving the torque-ampere ratio. Furthermore, the bidirectional Cuk converter is utilized to provide variable magnetization voltage for speed control and to achieve power factor correction (PFC) operation during charging mode (G2V mode). As the proposed SRM drive supports integrated on-board charger functionality, it reduces the cost and improves the overall power density of the EV.

However, the main disadvantage related to this configuration is the high windage loss generated at the air-gap due to the viscosity of the fluid, which can result in very high temperatures on the rotor surface and drag forces on the rotating components. This required an accurate prediction of windage losses to estimate the reduction in mechanical output torque and to evaluate exactly the heat generated on the rotor surface, which can cause a series of problems like the demagnetization of the magnet in PM machines. Also to accurately estimate the machine's performance.

This has been initially achieved with the support of wind atlases. The validation of wind atlas based on ground measurements is an essential work to enhance confidence on their usage. The latest version of Global Wind Atlas (GWA) has been introduced in November 2019 which indicates the wind potential across the globe at a node spacing of 250m. In this paper, Annual Average Wind Speed and Wind Power Density validation of GWA in offshore, onshore and Islands sites have been carried out for India based on the ground based measurements. This paper very first informs the quality check carried out on the atlas and secondly the validation of it based on the field measurement data. Based on the analysis, the GWA annual average wind speed predictions in offshore and onshore homogeneous sites are found to be within the defined uncertainty band of measured wind speeds. The GWA wind speed correlation in offshore sites is found to be better than other sites. However, in Complex and North Eastern states, the GWA wind speed in more than 50% of sites is falling out of the uncertainty band of measured wind speed. In Islands, the GWA underestimates the annual average wind speed in Lakshadweep and overestimates in Andaman & Nicobar.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059572","global wind atlas;uncertainty;wind power density;annual average wind speed","Renewable energy sources;Uncertainty;Correlation;Wind speed;Measurement uncertainty;Estimation;Wind farms","","","","","","14","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The major contributor to carbon emission is Power Sector and Transport sector. Indian government is promoting EMobility to reduce the carbon footprint in Transport sector by reduction of Oil Consumption. The batteries used in Electric Vehicles have a high energy density and after completing their guaranteed life in the vehicle, they are still left with a very high potential to serve as Energy Storage Equipment for improving Grid Stability. Investment in Renewable Energy is also increasing exponentially to reduce the carbon foot print and to transit towards a Carbon Neutral state. However, the major problem of Renewable energy is its poor reliability and limited availability. To increase the reliability of Renewable Energy, many methods have been suggested and implemented in the sector. In this paper, we have suggested the use of repurposed EV batteries as Grid Level Energy Storage System to increase the reliability of Renewable Energy plant. Financial analysis of using the repurposed EV Batteries has been done and a Comparative study was done amongst Renewable Energy Plant using new batteries for Energy Storage System, Renewable Energy Plant using repurposed EV Batteries for Energy Storage and a Conventional Coal-fired Thermal power plant. It is observed that used battery storage system is not only economical of the three but also offers many other benefits like lower payback period, avenues for re-using the EV Batteries, etc. With the Government Target of 30 % penetration of EV in the Transport Sector by 2030, market will be abundant with used EV batteries. It is also important for the Indian Grid to take adequate measures promptly to overcome the reliability and availability of Renewable Energy Plants by deploying large scale Grid Level Storage Systems in a phased manner.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059500","Electric Vehicle;LI-Ion Batteries;Grid Storage;Carbon Emission;FGD (flue gas desulfurization)","Renewable energy sources;Costs;Government;Power system stability;Electric vehicles;Stability analysis;Batteries","","","","","","16","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data-driven approach is one of the efficient techniques to develop models from Real time data to improve the efficiency of industrial processes and develop advanced control schemes. In this paper, linear data-driven models are developed for the Open Cycle (OC-OTEC) process by considering it as Single -Input Single Output (SISO) and Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO). Data is collected from OTEC Laboratory scale experimental setup established at National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) and data driven models are developed using system identification techniques. To identify the proper inputs and outputs, sensitivity analysis is carried out based on the collected data. Then, models for OC-OTEC are developed to generate power and freshwater. The manipulated variables for model development are considered as sea surface warm water flow rate and deep sea cold water flow rate and disturbance as sea surface temperature variation due to climate changes.

The MECG overlaps greatly with FECG in the frequency domain, while in the time domain, the QRS groups of MECG and FECG are often aliased, which increases the difficulty of FECG extraction. Through the experiment and improvement of the UNet model, we combine deep learning theory and the template subtraction method to separate FECG signals. A cascade model extraction method based on the AE-UNet3+ model is proposed to successfully isolate FECG components, and the effect of the model is evaluated using simulated and real abdominal electric data. In order to extract FECG from mixed signals, the cascade AE-UNet3+ model is used to suppress MECG to obtain residual error, and then the cascade AE-Unet3+ model is used to separate FECG from residual error. The F1 index of R peak detection accuracy on simulated abdominal electrical data and open real data is 97.24% and 94.74%, respectively. Compared with traditional methods (TS, TS-PCA, EKF, and UKF), we verify the effect of our AE-UNet3+ model by comparing the accuracy of R peak detection, signal-to-noise ratio, and fetal heart rate calculation as evaluation indexes, and objectively evaluating the final output prediction FECG.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072385","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

The magnetic induction detection system usually uses circular coils, and the eddy current field generated is mainly concentrated near the surface of the conductor, which has some limitations in reflecting the deep information of objects. In order to improve the central sensitivity, magnetic field permeability, and magnetic field energy convergence of the MIT system, magnetic induction tomography system using a magnetic focusing excitation coil was proposed in this paper. The mechanism of magnetic induction tomography using double 8-shaped magnetic focusing coil was studied, and a five-layer brain ball model simulation was established to study the distribution of magnetic field energy and focusing characteristics of magnetic field energy. The hardware detection systems using double 8-shaped excitation coils and traditional circular excitation coils were constructed. NaCl solution with different conductivity was used as the measured object, and multi-dimensional phase detection experiments were performed. The results proved that compared with the circular excitation coil MIT detection system, higher magnetic field strength at the same position was produced and larger phase difference data for detecting lesions with the same conductivity was obtained in magnetic focusing magnetic induction detection system using double 8-shaped coil, indicating that the double 8-shaped coil detection system had higher magnetic focusing property and could effectively improve the positioning accuracy of the detection area, which was of great significance for the detection of deep brain tissue lesions.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072389","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

To minimize computation mistakes, the characteristic spots of the electrocardiogram and impedance cardiogram signals are noted, respectively, to calibrate left ventricular ejection time using the electrocardiogram's QT, QRS, and RR intervals. Ten subjects were chosen to have their cardiac hemodynamic parameters calculated as their body position and breath status changed.

However, previous studies only developed exercise load assessment protocols in a comfortable environment, thus the effect of environmental factors has been neglected. Therefore, we propose to investigate the effect of environment on the relationship between exercise-to-resting heart rate difference (HRD) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). In this study, we collected electrocardiogram signals and RPE scores from 20 healthy adults when they were taking running exercise under different temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) conditions. Based on the data, we proposed a model for the relationship between RPE and HRD considering environmental factors through multiple regression method and analyze their effects on the RPE and HRD relationship by generalize overall trends and key turning points of the multiple regression model regarding environmental factors. Compared to the model without environmental factors, our model improves the accuracy of predicting RPE using HRD by 21.87%. We also found there are key turning points in HRD, T and RH which have major trend changes on the prediction of RPE using HRD: 50 bpm, 39deg C and 50%, respectively. The results of this prospective study provide a basis for accurate prediction of subjective exercise load based on HRD by introducing environmental factors.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072362","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Materials and Methods: GT1-7 cells were transfected with alpha1-adrenoceptor plasmid using lipofectamine; GT1-7 cells transfected with an NC empty vector were used as a negative control. Cells were then exponentially grown after starvation in a serum-free medium overnight and then stimulated with different concentration gradients ((0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 1.25, 6.25 ng/mL) of leptin to assess intracellular calcium concentrations. Fluo-4 was used to assess intracellular calcium ion concentration. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of Ca 2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKKbeta) and AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha), while Western blot was used to detect the protein expressions of CaMKKbeta and AMPKalpha in GT1-7-myc-alpha1-AR cells. Results: Leptin stimulated an [Ca2+]i response in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, increasing concentrations of leptin treatment increased CaMKKbeta mRNA and AMPKalpha mRNA levels in GT1-7-alpha1-AR cells. Conclusion: Leptin stimulated changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells through alpha1-adrenoceptor (alpha1-AR), thereby regulating the activity of the CaMKKbeta-AMPKalpha signaling pathway.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072364","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"
"Salient feature extraction for EEG pathology detection","T. Wu; Y. Zhong; X. Kong; L.

Nevertheless, due to the increasing morbidity of brain disorders and the limitations of direct visual inspection by trained neurophysiologists, i.e., being arbitrary and time-consuming, developing a computer-aided diagnosis system that could provide pre-diagnostic screening would be of great significance. This paper proposes an efficient method based on aggregation technique for EEG pathology detection. First, we adopt wavelet packet decomposition to break down the EEG signals into various frequency components, and some statistical features are calculated from each selected component. Subsequently, a novel and efficient technique is presented to decrease the dimensionality of the constructed feature space without degrading the feature quality. Finally, two different ensemble learning models are used to classify the extracted salient features into normal or abnormal classes. In a widely accepted EEG benchmark dataset, the categorical boosting-based classification method achieved accuracy and G-mean of 88.76% and 88.18%, respectively, comparing favorably to other recently published methods in performance. The results suggest that the highly compact and discriminative features could be effectively taken from raw EEG signals using the salient feature extraction technique and may pave the way for the development of a reliable and rapid abnormal EEG detection method.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072366","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

However, tumor classification based on the complementary correlation between CT images and genomic data has rarely been studied. In addition, when using multi-modal data features for tumor classification, most of the existing methods concatenate the multi-modal features directly, which ignore the importance of different modal features. Based on the above considerations, we construct an integrative imaging genomics classification framework for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, an adaptive weighted feature fusion method based on category contribution rate is proposed to distinguish the importance of different modal features adaptively in the classification process. Candidate’s pathogenic genes selected by correlation analysis have the potential to be suitable markers in distinguishing different subtypes of NSCLC. Our experimental results verify that our method has a better classification performance for multi-modal features than other related methods.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072370","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

To reduce artifacts in SHARP method, a deep learning network based on 3D CNN called SHARPnet was designed for background field removal. The reconstructed images with different truncation thresholds using the SHARP principle and the corresponding reconstructed images using laplacian boundary value (LBV) method are used as input and output to train the network. The truncated k-space division (TKD) method is applied to complete the magnetic susceptibility inversion for obtaining QSM. Quantitative measurements of the proposed method was compared with those of the SHARP and the LBV using the public in vivo dataset. The results showed that the proposed method is able to reconstruct the QSM image with less visual error and better quantitative metrics compared with the SHARP method. So SHARPnet can effectively solves the severe artifact in SHARP method by restoring the signal of the threshold truncation region.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072368","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

This review analyses and discusses the mechanisms and clinical efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of insomnia. Insomnia refers to difficulties in falling asleep, easy waking and early awakening in the middle of sleep, low quality of sleep, and a significant reduction in sleep time, with the lighter cases being difficulties in falling asleep, not sleeping soundly, waking up at times or not being able to go back to sleep after waking up, and the heavier cases being sleepless all night.In Chinese medicine, it is called Bu Mei. long-term insomnia can lead to neurological weakness and disorders of the human nervous system. This leads to symptoms such as dizziness, headache, palpitations, shortness of breath and memory loss, further causing endocrine and immune system dysfunction, which affects people's daily life and work.In recent years, the incidence of sleep disorders has been increasing year by year, and the age of onset is becoming younger. Studies have shown that 15% to 30% of adults and 10% of adolescents worldwide have varying degrees of sleep disorders [1-2].Western medicine mainly treats insomnia with medication, such as alprazolam, but there is a certain degree of dependency and tolerance to medication, which is not a long-term solution to treat insomnia.There are many different ways to treat insomnia in Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, tui na and Chinese herbal remedies, among which acupuncture is popular as a major treatment with few side effects, easy and effective. It is now widely used in the treatment of insomnia and has played an important role.A large number of experimental studies as well as clinical studies have shown that acupuncture significantly improves sleep quality and has good clinical efficacy in the treatment of insomnia. This paper presents a review of the mechanisms and clinical studies on the treatment of insomnia by acupuncture.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072372","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

This paper proposes a method for assessing human water metabolism through the measurement of human ICF and ECF volume based on bioelectrical impedance technology. The impedance of the human torso was measured at different frequencies, the volume of the ICF and ECF in the human torso was calculated by the modified Moissl equation, and the qualitative relationship between the volume of ICF and ECF and human water metabolism was established. The results showed that the volume of ICF and ECF calculated based on human trunk impedance increased gradually with gastric emptying, and the increase of trunk fluid was between 50% and 70% of pure water intake, which was within the normal range, and the remaining pure water intake was distributed to the extremities, indicating that the method proposed in this paper can be used to assess human water metabolism.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072374","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

The interfered segments in signals are of low quality and unreadable for both doctors and automated ECG analysis methods. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and eliminate these unreadable segments in ECG signals before further clinical usage. In this paper, we propose an unreadable ECG segment recognition method based on various types of hand-crafted features and LightGBM. A total of 106 features were extracted as Set-A, within which 30 features, i.e., Set-B, were obtained after feature selection. The single-lead ECG segments for evaluation in this work was generated from PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 database by dividing long signals into 5-second ECG segments. Then both the feature sets were trained and tested on the database with 54593 segments. An ac-curacy of 89.69±0.64% was obtained on Set-A and 89.46±0.60% on Set-B. The former showed a performance, and the latter was less time-consuming with an accuracy loss of 0.23%. Our results show that the proposed method could effectively identify unreadable ECG segments to enable efficient long-term single-lead ECG interpretation.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072378","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) was selected to estimate neurological dysfunction in the rats, and wet-dry method was used to detect the brain water content (BWC). The levels of mTOR/p-P70S6K/PSD95/SYP mRNAs and p-mTOR/p-P70S6K/PSD95/SYP proteins were observed by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Compared with the MC group, mNSS score decreased obviously, but expression levels of mTOR/P70S6K/PSD95/SYP mRNAs and p-mTOR/p-P70S6K/PSD95/SYP proteins increased significantly in the MSCs group (P<0.05). The BWC of the MSCs group decreased when compared with that of the MC group, but there were no significant differences between the two groups. MSCs transplantation may promote the expression of synaptic related proteins and enhance plasticity of synapses via the mTOR/P70S6K pathway, thus contributing to the rehabilitation of hemorrhagic stroke.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072382","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

For a long time, human beings often encounter the need to verify their personal identity in social activities, from ancient Dudie and signature Monogram to modern fingerprint, face and pupil recognition. Also driven by this demand, biometric technology has been greatly developed. Because the common physiological features such as fingerprint and palmprint may be forged, there is an urgent need for a new biometric feature with convenience, reliability and high anti-counterfeiting. With the deepening of people's understanding of physiological signals, the research of identity recognition based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is gradually popular at home and abroad. As a unique physiological signal of human body, ECG naturally has good anti-counterfeiting properties, so it is gradually used in military security, e-commerce and other fields. With the development of portable ECG equipment, convenient and fast finger acquisition has been popularized and has high universality. ECG signal is more and more valuable in the field of identity recognition.In this papaer, an ECG recognition algorithm based on the fusion model of Siamese Neural Networks is proposed. The model combines Siamese Neural Networks and XGBoost, takes into account the deep features and manual features, and integrates the model through LR weighting.

However, the lack of practical and stable algorithms has limited the use of mfMIT in clinical application research. In this study, we developed a dual-weighted frequency difference (DWFD) algorithm to address the limitations of the conventional weighted frequency difference method. This method does not require a priori information about the electrical conductivity of each tissue in the brain and only requires MIT measurements at three excitation frequencies to reconstruct an image of the hemorrhagic target. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified using a three-dimensional head simulation model with an actual anatomical structure and comparing it with that of the conventional method. The results of the simulation experiments revealed that the DWFD algorithm can extract the hemorrhage tissue information and reconstruct low-noise images in a complex brain model with multiple tissue backgrounds. Through this method, the influence of non-homogeneous tissues in the head, which is observed in the conventional method, is eliminated; thus, the method can be used in further experiments. The DWFD method can facilitate the use of mfMIT in clinical studies for the rapid detection of intracranial hemorrhage.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072386","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

The tongue coating samples were sequenced by 16sr RNA high-throughput sequencing technology, and the composition and structural characteristics of tongue coating flora were analyzed. Results: (a) The core skeleton of tongue coating flora at phylum level was Proteobacteria (43.87%), Firmicutes (29.39%), Bacteroidetes (12.37%), Actinobacteria (5.68%) and Fusobacteria (4.58%). The abundance of these five phyla fluctuated with time and the effect of oral antibiotics, but there was no significant difference. (b) Oral cephalosporin has a great impact on the flora of tongue coating, especially on the non-dominant flora. (c) Under normal conditions, the flora of tongue coating is mostly in a positive relationship. When treated by cephalosporin, the network of tongue coating flora was destroyed and the negative correlation of flora increased significantly. Conclusion: The structure of the core flora was stable. Take Cephrazidine left the tongue coating flora of the volunteer out of balance. Cephrazidine inhibited the abundance of tongue coating flora. Cephrazidine had little effect on the core dominant flora, and had great influence on non-dominant bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic bacteria.

However, the spherical harmonic function is constructed based on gradient coil design information, such as magnetic field distribution, which is hard to obtain for users and some venders who use commercial coils. Since the gradient field distribution is not provided by our coil supplier, this paper applied BP (back propagation) neural network to correct image distortions. Compared with traditional technique, the method proposed in this paper is able to correct distortions simply without using gradient coil information. The method calculated the real and practical position of landmark points that are selected as train dataset based on phantom structure. After training, the full image pixel coordinates could be calculated by trained neural network model. Interpolation was used to calculate the image intensity after position correction. Great improvement has been observed in each direction after correction. The correction method can be practically useful.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072357","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

In this study, 21 tea tea-cigarette products that are widely marketed were used as materials. With tobacco raw ma materials as positive control, and non non-tobacco raw materials as negative control, NicotianaNicotiana-specific molecular markers (Ntsp027 and Ntsp151) were used to identify and test the tea tea-cigarette products collected. Meanwhile, the nicotine content in the smoke of the tested tea tea-cigarette products was also detected. The results showed that 2 of the 21 tea tea-cigarette products M20 and M21, amplified tobacco genus genus-specific bands (i.e., 303 bp and 300 bp tobacco genus genus-specific fragments were amplified by Ntsp027 and Ntsp Ntsp151, respectively) after testing with tobacco genus genus-specific molecular markers, indicating that tea tea-cigarette products M20 and M21 contained tobacco raw materials. The GC GC-MS detection found that the smoke produced by burning 3 products M04, M20 and M21 con contained nicotine, and their nicotine contents were 0.92 mg/cig., 0.94 mg/cig. and 0.83 mg/cig., respectively, demonstrating that the 3 products either contained nicotinic raw materials or exogenously added nicotine. Based on the two collaborative detection methods of tobacco Nicotiana-specific markers and GC GC-MS, they can accurately determine that the two commercially available tea tea-cigarettes of M20 and M21 tested contain tobacco raw materials, which belong to the category of cigarettes and should be included in tobacco monopoly supervision; while the tea tea-cigarette product M04 tested adds exogenous nicotine components. The above results further show that the tobacco Nicotiana specific DNA marker invented is of great efficiency and precision for the identificat identification of tobacco raw material involvement, which is a credible supplement for the current GC GC-MS strategy of merely considering the nicotine as the category evidence of tobacco raw materials.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072361","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Further, the pan-cancer analysis of GPC3 was performed by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Among them, 6 types of immune cells, 150 immunomodulatory genes and 60 immune checkpoint genes were included. GPC3 protein was a hydrophilic protein composed of 580 amino acids and had signal peptide at 24-25 sites. Its secondary structure was predicted to be 56.90% helix and 43.10% coil. GPC3 gene was located on the X chromosome and was abnormally expression in 22 cancer types, which affected the prognosis of patients. In most cancer types, GPC3 expression was positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes and immune infiltration. Therefore, GPC3 is likely a marker of cancer immune infiltration and poor prognosis, and may become a new immune checkpoint gene, which provide a new idea for cancer treatment.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072359","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"
"Comparison of three time–frequency decomposition methods for the classification of EEG signals of epilepsy patients","X. Liu; J. -X. Liu; J. Wang; J. Shang; J. Mu; S.

Prevalent time-frequency-based methods of signal decomposition, such as the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and variational mode decomposition (VMD), deliver better performance than conventional Fourier decomposition on non-linear and non-stationary EEG signals. This study examines and compares these three time-frequency decomposition methods in terms of the classification of EEG signals. The EEG signals were decomposed into different sub-signals in different frequency bands using these methods, and five efficient features were extracted to represent different types of EEG signals. We then combined them into feature vectors and sent them to the three classifiers BLDA, RF, and SVM for classification using 10-fold cross-validation. Two EEG databases were used to evaluate the performance of the time-frequency-based decomposition methods, which contained ictal and interictal EEG signals, and focal and non-focal EEG signals. The results show that all three methods deliver fairly good classification results, especially VMD. VMD yielded the best classification on ictal and interictal signals with an accuracy of 100%, and also recorded the best classification on focal and non-focal signals with an accuracy of 87.10%.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072363","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Eight-year-old seedlings of C. japonicum introduced in Beijing were used as experimental materials, and their one-year dormant branches were selected and treated under -5, -10deg C, -15deg C, -20deg C, -25deg C and -30deg C, respectively. The relative electrical conductivity, contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble sugar, the activity of peroxidase (POD), contents of total water, and rate of bound water content to free water content were measured; and the semi lethal temperature (LT50) was calculated by fitting relative electrical conductivity in combination with the logistic equation. These results indicated a strong cold resistance of C. japonicum, with LT50 as -20.92deg C. With the decrease of the treatment temperature, the relative electrical conductivity gradually increased; MDA and soluble sugar, the activity of POD, and the ratio of bound water content to free water content tended initially rose and then declined at a lower temperature, while the contents of total water showed an opposite trend. There was some correlation among the indexes, and the principal component analysis showed that the accumulative contribution rate of six physiological indexes reached 90.996%. The activity of POD, soluble sugar, and rate of bound water content to free water content were the most important physiological indexes characterizing the cold resistance of the plant. In summary, with tolerance to a low temperature <-20deg C, C. japonicum could adapt to the Beijing winters characterized by low temperatures, as well as to cities with similar latitude, which encourages the introduction and cultivation.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072365","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

In this work, we study an adversary model that covers three security vulnerabilities, namely, over-privileged resource access, hidden code-manipulation and hidden content-manipulation. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, malicious skills can not only bypass the security tests in the vetting process, but also surreptitiously change their original functions in an attempt to steal users' personal information, obtain safety-sensitive information, or disseminate arbitrary information.

Hence, decoding the stochastic profile of m6A over transcriptome is invaluable to our understanding of its biological functions. The m6A site over 1624625 DRACH motifs on human exons were summarized from 40 experiments. Four machine learning algorithms, generalized linear model (GLM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest (RF), were implemented to build Poisson regression models. Compared with classification models used in previous studies, our model provides a new framework to integrate multiple single-base RNA modification datasets. We demonstrated that the Poisson regressors can better predict the biological and technical variation between experiments than classifiers trained with same features. In addition, we for the first time utilized the protein binding information for prediction and achieved significantly better performance than models based on only sequence-derived and genome-derived features.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072371","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

The early recognition of SCD is of great significance for the prevention of AD. For this study, we enrolled 69 patients with SCD and 75 normal controls (NC). According to the structural characteristics of T1 data, 3D-Resnet, 3D-densenet, and Swin Transformer (Swin-T) are used for classification. Due to the timing nature of BOLD data, RNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM are used for classification. Swin-T achieved the best results in the model with T1 data as input, while Bi-LSTM achieved the best results in the model with BOLD signal as input. Based on the above results, we fuse Swin-T and Bi-LSTM and use T1 and BOLD data as input. The fused model achieved better results than a single model with a separate T1 image or a separate BOLD signal as input. Of the 29 test sets, 23 were correctly classified. Although sensitivity was 75.0%, specificity was achieved at 84.6%. The F1-Score was also the highest among all models at 80.0%, and the AUC was 81.0%. The contribution of this study lies in the fusion of T1 mode data and BOLD mode data, providing ideas for SCD diagnosis.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072369","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Therefore, it is necessary to determine more sensitive markers for the detection of early PCa and stratify the risk of PCa in order to provide the best treatment for patients. At present, single cell RNA sequencing is very helpful for the study of tumor heterogeneity. Recently, a PCa single cell sequencing data was provided in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we thus integrated single cell sequencing data and omic data analyses to identify the potential biomarkers of PCa. Based on the cluster analysis, differential expression analysis, immune filtration analysis and clinical phenotype analysis, we found that APOD, DCN, FBLN1, CCL3 and MYL9 are potential PCa-related biomarkers, and these results were consisting with previous reports.

The electric field distribution induced by TTFields within a specific biological tissue is one of the most significant contributing factors to its clinical effects. However, only a few studies have reported on how to quantitatively measure the spatial EF distribution induced TTFields because of the difficulties in the EF measurement in vivo. This study proposed a method for EF intensity measurement. The method measures the potential difference and calculates the mean peak field intensities at the target using the differential electrodes. The appropriate range of electrode spacing was estimated and determined by the finite element method (FEM). A phantom was designed as the test platform for our proposed method, and the EF intensities were measured at different locations. The range of deviation between measured and corrected simulated values is 2.08% - 6.85%. The preliminary experiment result shows that our measurement platform can provide accurate and reliable EF measurements for TTFields. The proposed method could be used in future in vivo studies for measuring EF induced by TTFields.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072377","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Photoplethysmogram is a highly complex, chaotic signal, and health monitoring applications beyond the heart rate estimation, such as mental health monitoring, may possibly require the extraction of photoplethysmogram dynamical properties that can be achieved by the application of non-linear time series analysis. However, the applicability of nonlinear time series analysis imposes various requirements on the time series such as a sufficiently high sampling rate. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the sampling rate on the determinism of photoplethysmogram signals taken in reference conditions. The determinism, which is one of the fundamental properties of the dynamical system, was quantified by the recurrence quantification analysis, and the robustness of the determinism identification was verified by the surrogate data method. Results demonstrated that for the sampling frequency range 409.6~24.09 Hz only a minor decrease of determinism quantity is observed, thus confirming the consistency of the determinism detection in the photoplethysmogram time series of investigated sampling rates.","","978-3-8007-5964-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072381","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Secondly, the phase leg output voltage is sensed and corresponded with a pre-set range to further verify the short-circuit fault. If confirmed, an error signal is generated to turn off the power devices. Compared with state-of-art protection methods which locally turn off the power device, the proposed method features centralized protection, ultra-fast response, and high noise immunity capability. Experimental results confirm the excellent performance of the proposed protection scheme.","","978-3-8007-5911-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072352","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Dynamic LED visual markers use colourful LEDs as carriers, which are arranged in the order of red, green and blue colours to communicate information. Moreover, a coding rule based on ternary trees was also developed. The tracking and positioning algorithm applied the dual-thread design of the tracking and detection threads. The former completes coding verification using the Kalman filtering algorithm while tracking the LED markers in images. The latter positions LED and reads encoding information by detecting the initial signal. Such dual-thread design effectively decreases the computation workload and emphasises on accurate positioning and fast response.

However, MEC services rely on wireless channels to transmit data and thus are vulnerable to malicious behaviors such as eavesdropping. D2D (Device-to-Device) communication, com-bined with cooperative jamming techniques can efficiently protect MEC customers from such hostiles, and create a physical layer secured MEC environment. Hence in this paper, we propose a D2D-assisted secure MEC mechanism from a physical layer perspective. To tackle the challenge that eavesdroppers' locations are usually unknown, we formulate an eavesdropping risk zone (ERZ) to model the information leakage risk. We introduce a D2D-based cooperative jamming scheme where mobile users (MUs) transmit signals combined with data and artificial noise to reduce ERZ while motivating MUs' participation. Then we propose a contract-based incentive mechanism to promote D2D-assisted cooperative jamming that limits ERZ and improves the secure offloading rate of MEC services. Such incentives can tackle information asymmetry between MUs and incentive designers due to features like individual rationality (IR) and incentive comparability (IC). Further, we jointly optimize incentive costs and transmit power of MEC and D2D users to maximize the operator's MEG utility, where an IC-cost-based method is applied. By simulation, we first evaluate the feasibility of designed incentives, then we demonstrate the performance of the proposed mechanism under different conditions.","","979-8-3503-9631-7","10.1109/iSCI57775.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062820","MEC;D2D;eavesdropping attacks;physical layer security;cooperative jamming;incentive mechanism;contract theory","Wireless communication;Multi-access edge computing;Costs;Computational modeling;Physical layer;Device-to-device communication;Jamming","","","","","","27","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is one of the most accurate imaging algorithms but is also computation-intensive and thus time-consuming. In this paper, we focus on improving the parallel execution performance of the reverse-time migration imaging algorithm. Firstly, we analyze the performance bottlenecks of the reverse-time migration imaging algorithm with program profiling techniques. Based on the program profiling and performance analysis, we propose three effective performance improvement strategies, including the pipeline-based iterative propagation computation, the fine-grained data compression, and the GPU memory specification-based data transmission, to eliminate the performance bottle-necks. Extensive experiments on physical clusters and real-world datasets show that the proposed pipeline-based and fine-grained parallel RTM algorithm can reduce the running time by an average of 58.42% compared with the existing solutions.

"Budget in the Cloud: Analyzing Cost and Recommending Virtual Machine Workload","B. Zhang; V. Zhang; M. Hum","Cary, United States; Northville, United States; Arcadia, United States","2022 International Communication Engineering and Cloud Computing Conference (CECCC)","16 Mar 2023","2022","","","12","17","Due to the increasing popularity of cloud computing, the cost companies pay to use the cloud and its services are growing significantly. Higher costs of cloud computing technology contribute to the volatility of the cloud and the financial instability of companies that depend on the cloud. Companies have their own unique cloud budget, and staying within that budget can become problematic in light of increasing costs. To save cost, many cloud users look to their cloud provider rather than looking at their own cloud purchases. A lack of studies on cloud users’ virtual machine (VM) workload and how cloud users spend money necessitates analysis of the spending of cloud customers. In this research paper, we analyzed a real-world data set from Microsoft Azure collected in 2019 that includes approximately 2.7 million VM traces. We developed a linear regression based pricing model to calculate the cost and used this model to analyze Microsoft Azure’s VM workload by comparing the cores, memory, lifetime, average utilization, and cost of each trace. By analyzing Microsoft’s data, we observed that users are not fully utilizing the cloud resources they have paid for. With this idea in mind, we then quantified the waste and developed an algorithm to determine which VMs are the most ineffective. We applied our algorithm to Microsoft Azure’s data set, and our results show that our algorithm discovered over one million wasteful VMs and helped 6,600 users save $3.3 million dollars. Even though cloud computing prices are increasing, cloud customers can save significantly by understanding VM workload better and selecting better-fitting VMs.","","978-1-6654-7232-6","10.1109/CECCC56460.2022.10069750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10069750","VMs;cloud computing;cost;utilization;algorithm","Computers;Cloud computing;Analytical models;Costs;Linear regression;Companies;Pricing","","","","","","7","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The combined request for outlier detection and compensation makes it suitable to develop a regression-based outlier mining algorithm. To enhance the effectiveness of traditional regression-based algorithm, this paper proposes a novel one based on ensemble learning. In our outlier ensemble, the base regression models are learnt on a two-level ensemble structure. The aim of the first level is to enhance the robustness to unknown outliers by homogeneous ensemble. The goal of the second level is to improve the robustness to base regression model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid outlier ensemble, we use several real-world datasets from transonic wind tunnel and compare it with several underlying competitors.

The reconstruction is an inverse mathematical problem which is barely solved precisely especially in complex imaging scenes such as irregular pharmaceutical product imaging.

And it is proved that inductance and flux linkage have great influence on predictive control performance. Therefore, this paper introduces the corresponding improvement measure, in which, a flux linkage processing method is adopted to replace the flux linkage parameters in the prediction model with the resistance and inductance information. This means that the flux linkage is removed from the prediction model.

Restrictions of large poses and facial details(such as wrinkles, moles, beards etc.) are the common deficiencies of the most existing monocular 3D face reconstruction methods. To resolve the two defects, we propose an end-to-end system to provide 3D reconstructions of faces with details which express robustly under various backgrounds, pose rotations and occlusions. To obtain the facial detail informations, we leverage the image-to-image translation network (we call it p2p-net for short) to make pixel to pixel estimation from the input RGB image to depth map. This precise per-pixel estimation can provide depth value for facial details. And we use a procedure similar to image inpainting to recover the missing details. Simultaneously, for adapting pose rotation and resolving occlusions, we use CNNs to estimate a basic facial model based on 3D Morphable Model(3DMM), which can compensate the unseen facial part in the input image and decrease the deviation of final 3D model by fitting with the dense depth map. We propose an Identity Shape Loss function to enhance the basic facial model and we add a Multi-view Identity Loss that compare the features of the 3D face fusion and the ground truth from multi-view angles. The training data for p2p-net is from 3D scanning system, and we augment the dataset to a larger magnitude for a more generic training. Comparing to other state-of-the-art methods of 3D face reconstruction, we evaluate our method on in-the-wild face images. the qualitative and quantitative comparison show that our method performs both well on robustness and accuracy especially when facing non-frontal pose problems.","","979-8-3503-9633-1","10.1109/CSE57773.2022.00013","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1712600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62133005,61733004,62027810,61971071); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062632","3D face reconstruction;depth estimation;Convolutional Neural Network;Single Monocular Images","Training;Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Image resolution;Shape;Estimation","","","","","","40","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both models, when applied to raw data with minimal noise filtering, demonstrated slightly better accuracy rates than the traditional predictive methods. The optimal pre-preprocessing method to obtain fixed-length BCI feedback control data was invented. A novel BCI experiment design was created to fix the length of the BCI feedback control period to better utilize the trial time and EEG data.

Traditional path selection algorithms mainly deal with single routing criterion, which is insufficient in this context. In addition, network operators need to optimize the traffic distribution of all flows with limited network resources. In this paper, we propose a method of hybrid path selection for individual flows and overall optimization for all the flows. In our method, we use different algorithms to find paths for two types of traffic, SLA-required traffic and background traffic. The paths for SLA-required traffic are selected based on multi criteria such as delay, cost, and availability, and that for background traffic are based on K shortest paths (KSP) regarding one criterion. Moreover, we consider optimization of the overall objective and determine the bandwidth allocation on the selected paths by linear programming and a greedy algorithm. Specifically, we consider a typical traffic engineering scenario: minimizing the maximal link utilization. The results show that our method is better than Equal Cost Multi-Path with KSP in terms of the amount of satisfactory SLA-required flows and minimization of maximal link utilization.","","978-1-6654-7232-6","10.1109/CECCC56460.2022.10069947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10069947","multi criteria;path selection;traffic engineering optimization","Greedy algorithms;Technological innovation;Costs;Heuristic algorithms;Routing;Minimization;Linear programming","","","","","","17","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because power transmission lines are often distributed in a very harsh environment, they are extremely susceptible to being interfered with by dynamic scenarios and face transmission failures. Therefore, to maintain the power transmission, it is urgent to monitor the status of transmission lines in real time. Traditional communication technologies, such as GPRS, optical fiber, ZigBee, etc. are widely used in power monitoring systems, but their limitations make it difficult to meet the remote monitoring of transmission lines. The long-range (LoRa) technology has the characteristics of wide coverage and low energy consumption, providing an opportunity to make up for the “last-mile” gap in transmission-line monitoring. The challenges to monitoring the transmission lines are: 1) the nodes far away from the base station need to transmit the data with considerable transmission power; 2) the nodes outside the communication range of the base station cannot successfully send the data to the base station. To address these problems, this paper proposed a multi-hop communication strategy to monitor the status of transmission lines. First, we use a graph to represent the LoRa nodes and transfer the 3-phase line monitoring structure to the 1-phase line monitoring. Second, we construct an energy consumption model for each LoRa node in the multi-hop scenario. Third, we develop a max-min optimization problem to compute a multi-hop scheme for minimizing the overall energy consumption for the transmission-line monitoring and maximizing the transmission range for the base station. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to analyze the bottleneck of the energy consumption of the overall monitoring system with LoRa and the maximum range that the base station can cover.","","979-8-3503-9631-7","10.1109/iSCI57775.2022.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062575","Transmission line monitoring;wireless communication;LoRa","Energy consumption;Base stations;Analytical models;Power transmission lines;Computational modeling;Spread spectrum communication;Minimax techniques","","","","","","14","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they seldom learn meta-paths representations which can provide important interaction information. What's more, the impact of different meta-paths on recommendation are neglected. In order to deal with these unsolved problems, we propose an attention based collaborator recommendation method in the setting of heterogeneous academic networks. Firstly, we select some meta-paths according to the HIN schema. Secondly, the embeddings of nodes and meta-path instances are generated by employing the Skip-gram and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) models respectively. Thirdly, the attention mechanism is devised to integrate the multiple sources of embeddings so as to produce the author representations and meta-path based context representations.

It can effectively reduce high-frequency current harmonics and vibration. As an improved period modulation method, Uniform Distributed Pulse Width Modulation (UDPWM) is preferred to reduce the current total harmonic distortion (THD). For the dual three-phase motors, reverse winding pulse width modulation (RWPWM) can theoretically eliminate common-mode voltage (CMV). In this paper, the novel RW-RPWM and RW-UDPWM are proposed by combining the above PWM methods, which can achieve the suppression of both CMV and vibration.

A significantly large amount of data is obtained in text format due to the ease of access nowadays. Most modern techniques focus on exploring large sets of textual data to build forecasting models; they tend to ignore the importance of temporal information which is often the main ingredient to determine the performance of analysis, especially in the public policy view. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, a dataset called COVID-News is collected from three news agencies, which consists of article segments related to wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we propose a long-short term memory (LSTM)-based learning model to predict the attitude of the articles from the three news agencies towards wearing a mask with both temporal and textural information. Experimental results on COVID-News dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed LSTM-based algorithm.","","979-8-3503-9633-1","10.1109/CSE57773.2022.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062623","Natural language processing;public opinion analysis;textual data;long-short term memory","COVID-19;Training;Analytical models;Scientific computing;Time series analysis;Machine learning;Predictive models","","","","","","15","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When designing high-speed motors, it is always necessary to take into account the mechanical strength of the rotor, as the high centrifugal force of the rotor at high speeds can lead to rotor cracking. Therefore, for rotors, such as interior permanent-magnet synchronous rotors and synchronous reluctance rotors, which have flux bridges to withstand the centrifugal forces of rotors, wider flux bridges are required as the speed increases. However, wider flux bridge may result in higher flux leakage and lower torque. The power density of the motor might not increase. This paper proposes new ways to increase the mechanical strength and reduce the flux leakage of the synchronous rotors. Improvements to the motor are evaluated and techniques for obtaining the required magnetic materials are illustrated.","","978-3-8007-5911-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072307","","","","","","","","","","16 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

These codecs are generally built on human perceptual models. Perceptual quality assessment studies, in which participants have to rate the perceived quality of such compressed signals, are an established tool to evaluate the performance of a given codec. In order to extend while also maintain consistency with previous work on evaluating the perceptual quality of vibrotactile codecs, we included two different age groups in our assessment procedure that is based on perceptual comparison judgements, while keeping the signal and compression ratio selection consistent with prior work. The ratings of the perceptual qualities of the compressed signals were associated with compression ratio, material and interaction speed. Older participants showed a greater between-person variability in quality rating scores but no significant difference in mean rating from younger adults. Our results suggest that the quality of compressed vibrotactile signal can vary in a material-, and interaction speed-dependent manner.

The Open RAN concept enables the flexible customization of mobile network architectures according to specific use cases or required Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). As the diversity of architecture component vendors further increases and innovations further accelerate with 6G, the interoperability of network elements needs to be guaranteed so as to ensure flexible 6G system configurations. This paper describes the interoperability aspects in Open RAN and gives an overview of the available 5G Open RAN testbed ecosystem which is provided by the French-German collaboration project 5G-OPERA. More specifically, three major testbeds are introduced in this paper: 1) The OpenAirInterface (OAI) testbed is an open-source project developing RAN, Core Network (CN), and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). 2) The 5G-Core testbed including traditional vendors and Open RAN solutions, currently complemented with open-source CNs. 3) The industrial testbed, which is the largest available Open RAN testbed for private networks in Germany. These testbeds enable the benchmarking of traditional and new vendors and thus provide an environment for examining the interoperability of network components from different vendors as well as particular component features. Moreover, Open RAN boosts innovations, such as network slicing and localization, which can be tested on the 5G-OPERA experimental platform. The insights provided in this paper into 5G testbeds can contribute to the foundations for building experimental platforms for examining the interoperability of future 6G system components.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071940","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

This development has been driven by the increasing complexity of modern wireless technologies and the extensive softwarization of these through projects such as a Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). In this context, a number of small- to mid-scale testbeds have emerged, employing a variety of technologies to target a wide array of use-cases and scenarios in the context of novel mobile communication technologies such as 5G and beyond-5G. Little work, however, has yet been devoted to developing a standard framework for wireless testbed automation which is hardwareagnostic and compatible with edge- and cloud-native technologies. Such a solution would simplify the development of new testbeds by completely or partially removing the requirement for custom management and orchestration software. In this paper, we present the first such mostly hardwareagnostic wireless testbed automation framework, Ainur. It is designed to configure, manage, orchestrate, and deploy workloads from an end-to-end perspective. Ainur is built on top of cloudnative technologies such as Docker, and is provided as FOSS to the community through the KTH-EXPECA/Ainur repository on GitHub.

Differently from the standard multiple source system, which is analyzed in the literature from the only game theoretic standpoint of competing sources, we show that our system showcases collaborative-like behaviors thanks to correlation among the source transmissions.

Using different lower layer functional split options (e.g., 7-1, 7-2, 7- 2x, and 7-3), this paper provides a theoretical and simulation analysis of the 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer specifications to achieve a fronthaul bandwidth that can be supported by the Ka-band. These functional split options are then compared in terms of fronthaul bandwidth, theoretical throughput, connection density, number of functions deployed at the UAV, and the energy consumption of the fronthaul transmission to determine which functional split option is better suited for a multi-layered Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN).","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071927","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Besides preserving privacy, such an approach reduces the communications overhead. Therefore, it is a promising method for learning in wireless communication networks with scarce communication resources, especially for devices such as UAVs that have limited access to power resources. Nevertheless, implementing FL in UAV-enabled networks is challenging as the network architecture and management play crucial roles in the convergence of the FL algorithm. In particular, the conventional UAV placement methods that maximize coverage often result in prohibitive FL delays. In addition, the uncertainty and lack of a priori information about, for example, the active sensors’ density and channel quality, exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we first analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAVenabled wireless sensor network with energy harvesting. We then apply multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the network coverage while minimizing the FL delay. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our approach.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071929","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

A control stability based scheduling metric ’Probability of Instability’ is evaluated for the resource allocation. The performance of stability based RA scheme is compared with the maximum SNR based RA scheme and control error first approach in an overloaded and non-overloaded scenario. The RA scheme with the stability constraints significantly reduces the resource utilization and is able to schedule more number of AGVs while maintaining its stability. Moreover, the proposed RA scheme is independent of control state and depends upon consecutive packet errors, the control parameters like sampling time and AGV velocity. Furthermore, we also analyse the impact of RA schemes on the AGV’s stability and error performance, and evaluated the number of unstable AGVs.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071933","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

These technologies have fostered newly designed intelligent data-driven solutions for managing large sets of diverse cellular functionalities, basically impossible to implement in traditionally closed cellular architectures. Despite the evident interest of industry on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions for closed-loop control of the Radio Access Network (RAN), and several research works in the field, their design is far from mainstream, and it is still a sophisticated – and often overlooked – operation. In this paper, we discuss how to design AI/ML solutions for the intelligent closed-loop control of the Open RAN, providing guidelines and insights based on exemplary solutions with high-performance record. We then show how to embed these solutions into xApps instantiated on the O-RAN nearreal-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) through OpenRAN Gym, the first publicly available toolbox for data-driven ORAN experimentation at scale. We showcase a use case of an xApp developed with OpenRAN Gym and tested on a cellular network with 7 base stations and 42 users deployed on the Colosseum wireless network emulator. Our demonstration shows the high degree of flexibility of the OpenRAN Gym-based xApp development environment, which is independent of deployment scenarios and traffic demand.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071941","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

HBM has much potential for purposes of multiplexing users, maximizing the overall system data rate, and accommodating each receiver’s channel. Up until now, HBM has been explored using quadrature and amplitude modulations. However, given the non-linearity of THz transmitters, modulations with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) are discouraged. In this paper, phase-only HBM is proposed, with the goal of solving the PAPR problem. In particular, after defining the key parameters affecting the performance of HBM using phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, an optimal constellation design is derived. The solution is numerically and experimentally tested and benchmarked. The results show the potential of PSK-HBM as a solution for THz communications to increase the data rate without increasing the PAPR.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071939","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Currently, the proposed architectures envision the realisation of a fully softwarized network continuum, with in-network intelligence for network management and operations. Moreover, more stringent requirements than 5G have been set in order to support new use cases like telepresence and massive twinning. However, these requirements implies some critical tradeoffs, which are going to limit the promises of 6G. In order to go beyond the intrinsic limitations of 6G, new resources and technologies should be found. That is why, some research groups are now investigating how quantum technologies can be integrated into 6G. This works deals with the scenario of sending classical information via a quantum channel, using the so-called dense coding protocol. If this channel is not ideal, quantum errors can affect the reliability of the communication. Nevertheless, quantum error-correcting codes are still very demanding in terms of resources and redundancy. Then, this work investigates how classical error-correcting codes (in particular, Reed-Solomon codes and turbo codes) can be applied to make reliable classical communications via quantum channels. The preliminary results of this paper show that the employment of classical forward error correction in future hybrid 6G-quantum networks can be very promising.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071945","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

In particular, in this paper we evaluate the latency introduced by computations at the encoder and decoder when employing identification codes. For this, we implement them using an explicit code construction based on Reed-Solomon codes and integrate them into a single carrier transmission system using software-defined radios. Our evaluation of the practical aspects of identification codes show that unless care is taken, these trade-offs can compromise the theoretical advantage given by the exponentially large identification rates.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071924","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an emerging facility that can be utilized to assist wireless communications. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed such that the phase shifts of its elements are reconfigured to create favorable beam steering, which in turn mitigates undesired interference from other existing links in the network. In this paper, we consider a UAV equipped with an RIS operating in THz, where a cellular user link, in addition to a number of Device-to-Device (D2D) pairs links are considered. The direct paths between each two communicating nodes are considered as well as the RIS-reflected paths. Then, the sum rate is derived under this scenario. Accordingly, a joint power allocation and phase shifts optimization scheme is proposed for the sake of maximizing the sum rate. The proposed joint power allocation and phase shifts optimization scheme is evaluated in terms of the achieved sum rate. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme surpasses three other schemes, achieving the highest sum rate among them all, under varying different parameters in the network.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071926","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

This extra degree of freedom introduces new challenges for resource allocation. Buffer state information (BSI), like the size and age of packets waiting for transmission, can be used to improve scheduling in OMA systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of BSI on the performance of a centralized scheduler in an uplink multicarrier NOMA scenario with UEs having various data rate and latency requirements. To handle the large combinatorial space of allocating UEs to the resources, we propose a novel scheduler based on actor-critic reinforcement learning incorporating BSI. Training and evaluation are carried out using Nokia’s “wireless suite”. We propose various novel techniques to both stabilize and speed up training.

This allows for centralized management of the network. However, complete centralization of the controller’s functions raises the issue of the central point of failure, latency, and scalability. Distributed controller deployment is adopted to optimize scalability and latency problems. However, the existing controllers are monolithic, resulting in code inefficiency for distributed deployment. Recently, microservicesbased SDN solutions have been started and deployed as virtual network functions, enabling flexible deployment. Nonetheless, the softwarization of network functionalities introduces network I/O performance degradation both considering deployments based on virtual machines and containers. This paper first introduces a microservices-based SDN solution based on Ryu SDN Framework. Then investigates whether running Ryu’s network functionalities in a softwarized environment (e.g., virtual machine and container) would have a significant network I/O performance degradation. In particular, this work examines more in deep the Docker Container technology and analyzes its network setups. Multiple measurements were performed locally in a single machine.

We maximize the parallelization between communication and computation among the collaborative EDs by optimizing the task partitioning ratio based on the segment-based partitioning. Experimental results show that the distributed inference HALP achieves 1.7× inference acceleration for VGG-16. Then, we combine distributed inference with conventional neural network model compression by setting up different shrinking hyperparameters for MobileNet-V1. In this way, we can further accelerate inference but at the cost of inference accuracy loss. To strike a balance between latency and accuracy, we propose dynamic model selection to select a model which provides the highest accuracy within the latency constraint. It is shown that the model selection with distributed inference HALP can significantly improve service reliability compared to the conventional stand-alone computation.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071934","","","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

We propose a terrain-constrained 3D edge routing optimization problem to obtain the optimal edge with the shortest length and the fewest terrain feature points while keeping the convexity and terrain disocclusion. The main idea is to solve combinatorial optimization using a convex-hull-directed geometric technique. A convex hull capability model (CHCM) describes that the convex hull can not only extract topographic feature points, but also support graph aesthetic criteria. Under the guidance of CHCM, the optimization is solved by the two chains of geometric evolution: the first one extracts topographic feature polyline via an auxiliary closed convex hull on the 2D earth slice, and the second one uses convex-hull-based convex-preserving Bezier interpolation to further smooth the polyline as optimal edge. In addition, the lightness of the remote sensing image is adjusted in color space to reduce image interference. Simulation results show that our approaches can eliminate visual clutters such as piercing mountains and visual zigzags caused by terrain occlusion, in the experimental case, the number of 3D projected edge intersections is reduced by 42%, and topographic feature points only account for 24% of the total sampling points.

In making a machine more intelligent, the first step is to make it recognize and understand human emotions. In this paper, we propose ASTNet, a spatial-temporal convolution network for analyzing human emotions from electroencephalography (EEG). ASTNet consists of a kernel attention block, a spatial convolutional block, and a temporal dependent block, which sequentially learns the representations of EEG. To learn strong features with temporal and frequency attributes, the first block consists of different convolution kernels whose length is related to the sampling frequency of EEG. Although the spatial resolution of EEG is low, the analysis of spatial representation is indispensable. The second block is used to analyze the emotional representation of the global brain signals in the spatial domain. EEG signals are typical digital time series data. To utilize the brain signals’ temporal representation, the third block is used to improve recognition accuracy. Finally, to evaluate the proposed method, we conduct comparative experiments on the DEAP dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms these methods on the valence label.","","978-1-6654-9250-8","10.1109/ICCGIV57403.2022.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062639","affective computing;deep learning;convolutional neural network;electroencephalography;emotion recognition","Emotion recognition;Image recognition;Convolution;Time series analysis;Electroencephalography;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Kernel","","","","","","20","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in the unstructured environment, loopback detection is still a challenging task, especially in 2D laser SLAM. The scanning frame of 2D lidar carries less information, and it is difficult to extract features. Most of the current solutions are direct point cloud matching, which has the disadvantage of heavy computation. To solve this problem, a loop-back detection method based on Scan Context and principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed in this paper. The method constructs the scanning Context of laser scanning frame, reduces its dimension, and uses the feature vectors after dimensionality reduction to build KD tree to accelerate loop-back detection. This method can reduce the consumption of computing resources while ensuring the accuracy of loopback detection. In addition, we implement a new 2D laser SLAM framework based on the loopback detection method. Experimental results show that the loopback detection method has good robustness in both indoor and outdoor environments, and has very low requirements on hardware resources. It can also achieve high loopback detection frequency in embedded systems.","","978-1-6654-9250-8","10.1109/ICCGIV57403.2022.00006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062606","component;SLAM;Loopback detection;Scan context;PCA","Point cloud compression;Dimensionality reduction;Laser radar;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Feature extraction;Hardware;Laser applications","","","","","","11","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Abstract relationship among objects in the world can be represented by graph visualization on the DE. However, because the diversity of curvature on ellipsoid, it is generally difficult to construct accurate and concise curvature-fitting edges for 3D graph visualization. Therefore, a curvature-fitting ellipsoidal graph visualization algorithm (CFE) is proposed to address the gap. The core work is a novel ellipsoidal linear interpolation (ELERP) with closed form. ELERP is derived by the combination of spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) and composite transformation W. W accomplishes the scaled transformation from general ellipsoid into unit sphere and implements the rotation from 3D inclined plane into 2D XY-plane. In W, Householder matrix H is from the Hadamard product generated from the geometric composite information of ellipsoid and plane. H has concise computation stemmed from the excellent properties that its inverse and transpose are itself. Lastly, using ELERP and Bezier interpolation to construct a new beret-style and curvature-fitting edge. The experimental results verify the validity of CFE. Compared with classical complex geodesic algorithm, CFE is faster and more concise. Generally, CFE provides an ellipsoidal graph visualization, which will be applied on ellipsoid-based celestial bodies in the vast universe, such as, earth, moon and Mars.","","978-1-6654-9250-8","10.1109/ICCGIV57403.2022.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062543","Spherical linear interpolation;ellipsoid linear interpolation;Bezier interpolation;Householder matrix;graph visualization","Earth;Visualization;Interpolation;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Moon;Digital twins","","","","","","13","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method takes the flippability of the central pixels in 3 × 3 binary blocks as the fundamental method. Then the special pattern pairs are taken as the embedding objects, whose central pixel flippability is nonzero and won’t change after flipping. In this way, the visual quality can remain satisfying after embedding. Moreover, the proposed method uses overlapping blocks scanning to enlarge the embedding capacity. Thus, this research presents a reversible watermarking algorithm for halftone images with high capacity. Test shows that the algorithm can make the watermarked images maintain good visual quality after embedding a large watermark. Compared to original images, the watermarked images are of low visual distortion and human eyes can’t detect the difference.","","978-1-6654-9250-8","10.1109/ICCGIV57403.2022.00054","Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062696","halftone image;flippability;reversible watermarking;high capacity","Visualization;Wireless sensor networks;Watermarking;Distortion;Virtualization","","","","","","15","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finally, the parameters obtained from this solution are incorporated into the atmospheric scattering model. Residual-in-residual dense blocks (RRDB) are introduced to extract high-level feature information from the inverted images.

For the circuits of high-value electrical equipment, high-precision detection devices will be developed to check if there are any missing components on the circuit. However, for non-scale production of electrical equipment, manual inspection methods are still used to check the circuit boards of electrical equipment. To solve this problem, an unsupervised detection method for missing circuit components is proposed based on difference images and cluster analysis. By the proposed method, the quality inspector only needs to determine a circuit board with complete components and good function as a standard circuit board before testing. Then, a difference image is calculated between the standard image and the target image (i.e., the image to be tested). The difference image is divided into blocks and the eigenvector of each image block is obtained. By employing cluster analysis of the eigenvectors, missing components on the circuit are detected and located. Experimental results show that the proposed achieves a better performance on missing component detection compared with other unsupervised and supervised methods.","","978-1-6654-9250-8","10.1109/ICCGIV57403.2022.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062729","Keywords-unsupervised detection;missing circuit components;difference images;cluster analysis","Fuses;Printed circuits;Manuals;Inspection;Robustness;Production facilities;Virtualization","","","","","","12","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been widely used in image composition, film production and video editing etc. The current matting method based on image inpainting uses a deep neural network to inpaint the foreground target and background region to further improve the accuracy of alpha matte. However, when the trimap contains large unknown regions, the excessive inpainting of foreground and background produce a lot of redundant information, which leads to a degradation of alpha matte quality. Therefore, to address this issue, a natural image matting method based on image inpainting is designed. This method involves the refinement process for trimap, which improves the quality of the trimap, enlarges the foreground and background regions providing additional information for image matting. Extensive experimental results on the composition-1k dataset demonstrate that the presented method provide high-quality alpha mattes not only in the case that the trimap contains small unknown regions, but also in the case that the trimap contains large unknown regions.","","978-1-6654-9250-8","10.1109/ICCGIV57403.2022.00023","Guizhou Minzu University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062697","deep image matting;image inpainting;trimap refinement module;alpha matte","Degradation;Deep learning;Computer vision;Image processing;Refining;Neural networks;Production","","","","","","23","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposed a watermarking scheme for medical image data based on discrete wavelet transform. We introduce the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to construct our watermarking scheme to its similarity to the human visual system in processing spatial information. In addition to the DWT and SVD, we adopted the Arnold transformation in the implantation and extraction process for our watermark to provide better protection than the state-of-the-art.

As the sensors are subject to harsh operating conditions they develop faults. The faulty sensor readings and the faulty sensors need to be isolated in real-time and remedial measures to be taken for maintaining system stability. Drift faults are slow-changing constant faults that get induced into the sensor measurements and are difficult to isolate. Drift faults can be linear or may be nonlinear. Though studies have been conducted for linear drift fault isolation, studies related to nonlinear drifts are limited. Studies have achieved a very high level of accuracy while deploying Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) has also shown promising results as a tool for noise reduction and feature extraction. Keeping these things in view, in the present study the ability of pre-trained DCNN through transfer learning is exploited, and scalograms as the feature extractor from the sensor signals. Three nonlinear drift fault modes are simulated to test the sensitivity of the DCNN models under different fault scenarios. The performance of the proposed model for the classification of nonlinear drift faults is compared with other models in terms of accuracy and loss. The proposed Inception V3-based DCNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.05% in classifying nonlinear drift faults.

The cloud computing mode can meet the computing needs of various terminal applications because of its powerful computing power, but the response quality of intelligent tasks is reduced due to the large transmission delay from the terminal device to the cloud computing center. Edge computing reduces latency by shortening the data transmission distance, but the heterogeneity of edge nodes leads to tasks with different response qualities when offloaded to different servers. In addition, limited bandwidth resources prompt a rational resource allocation strategy to improve system efficiency. Therefore, this paper jointly studies task offloading and resource allocation strategies in the cloud-edge collaborative environment with the goal of minimizing the response time. In order to reasonably utilize the limited edge resources, we firstly divide tasks into delay-tolerant, delay-hypersensitive and delay-hyposensitive tasks according to their delay tolerance. We combine the greedy strategy to propose a classification offloading strategy and allocate the bandwidth resource amount according to the offloading location, which reduces the task response time while ensuring resource utilization. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed strategy. Compared with other algorithms in comparative experiments, the algorithm proposed in this paper effectively reduces the response time of tasks and improves the performance of the system.","","978-1-6654-6446-8","10.1109/CISDS57597.2022.00036","State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062782","Task Offloading;Resource Allocation;Edge-cloud Collaboration","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Bandwidth;Real-time systems;Delays;Time factors;Resource management","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome the shortcoming of low SNR, the coherent accumulation is implemented to reduce the noise effect. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the quality of image reconstruction.","","978-1-6654-6446-8","10.1109/CISDS57597.2022.00020","State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062604","Millimeter-wave;FMCW;image reconstruction;SAR;noise reduction","Simulation;Transmitting antennas;Noise reduction;Radar imaging;Millimeter wave radar;Radar antennas;Radar polarimetry","","","","","","16","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The commonly used sensors include cameras, lidar and infrared sensor. Although lidar is able to locate target precisely thanks to its range and angular information in clear environment, it is difficult to detect target in cluttered environment. On the other hand, with the development of detection models based on deep learning, the target detection can be well solved using images from monocular camera, however, only using monocular camera is hard to determine the depth information of the target object, it can not accurately obtain the position of the target object. Therefore, in order to take advantage of pros of both monocular camera and 2d lidar, this paper proposes a target tracking algorithm for a mobile robot by combining a monocular camera and 2D lidar. The CSI camera is used to detect and track the target by deep convolution neural network models YOLOv5 and Deep SORT, respectively, while the 2D lidar is used to determine the angle and distance of the target corresponding to the one detected and tracked using images from camera.

The heterogeneous information network is widely used in learning resource recommendation nowadays thanks to its capacity of intuitively representing different entities and complex relationships between entities. However, it’s tricky to use rich semantic information in it to do entity modelling. To solve this problem, this paper analyses and mines students’ behavioural data on MOOCs to obtain their personalized features, then uses graph embedding to incorporate weight and construct a weighted heterogeneous information network to recommend online video courses. The experiments utilise the data of the MOOCCube to investigate the effectiveness of various meta-path combinations. The optimal number of layers for the graph convolutional network, latent factors, and entity embedding dimension are determined through comparative studies.

Considering radar is relatively more reliable in most harsh environments, we propose an attention-based deep learning framework for camera and radar fusion, which significantly improves object detection accuracy in severe weather conditions. Specifically, our framework is composed of three parts: 1) a radar branch for predicting the location of objects in the radar plane, 2) a projected attention module, and 3) a camera branch trained based on the attention fusion feature from the projected attention module. In contrast to previous approaches, our approach focuses the learning attention to object locations based on radar data projections, reducing the effect of image blurring in rainy and foggy weather conditions.

Traditional social network group decision-making methods fail to reveal the connection between the complete social network structure and group decision-making problems. Therefore, LMGDM is proposed as a valid method to study the influence of subgroup structure on decision outcomes in social networks. Firstly, the subgroup partitioning process is modelled as a non-cooperative game between all nodes and treats nodes as self-serving decision makers, with each decision maker adopting the most appropriate strategy to maximize its own payoff. Further, it turns out that the game matches potential game, suggesting that the Nash equilibrium must exist. Thus, an algorithm based on the loglinear model is designed to converge the game to a pure Nash equilibrium solution. Finally, multiple sets of experiments under the real datasets verified the effectiveness of the algorithm and its good adaptability under complex data sets.","","978-1-6654-6446-8","10.1109/CISDS57597.2022.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062652","group decision making;game;subgroup","Adaptation models;Social networking (online);Decision making;Games;Data science;Nash equilibrium;Data models","","","","","","11","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The greatest obstacle in introducing fairness metrics is it does not really measure what we intend for it to do. This can be seen with the “burden fairness apparency” metric, which states if a task is balanced in terms of restriction on size but the workload change that results from that restriction leads to a discrepant disparity between tasks. Fairness metric is determined by the system's calculation of the ratio and type of mistakes it does intrinsically. Several firms develop fair engines because calculating fairness is considered a profit losing activity, meaning that the payback period for this project has to be comparably lower than traditional setups if it wants to succeed in an open market. In this paper, the effectiveness of the burden fairness metric is evaluated with an ML-based approach.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10059682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059682","Fairness metrics;Burden;Statistical parity;Decision boundary;Sensitive attributes;Unprivileged groups;Classification","Measurement;Computer science;Computational modeling;Evolutionary computation;Computational efficiency;Task analysis;Engines","","","","","","19","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A technology known as Traffic Sign Recognition can be used to determine a large number of different traffic signs. Traffic Sign Recognition is a technique that enables self-driving or autonomous vehicles to recognize traffic signs on the road. We must classify the images into their appropriate categories or groupings once they have been recognized. We accomplish this by creating a Convolutional Neural Network model. We must apply a discipline of artificial intelligence known as computer vision to derive information from the images acquired and recognized by the Traffic Sign Recognition and make recommendations based on that knowledge. In our paper, we'll use a Convolutional Neural Network model to create distinct indications in the image that may be sorted into several categories. As a result, the system can read and understand traffic signs, which is a crucial duty in the creation and improvement of autonomous vehicles.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, systematic, and completely automated approach for verification of DFT gaskets. The gaskets have to work predictably being cycle-accurate and in sequence as per expectation. Any deviation from the specification could have serious consequences including chip failure, subsequently causing billions of $ cost. An adoptable, random, predictable, cycle-accurate and robust infrastructure had to be built to verify the DFT gaskets so as to ensure the design is bug free. To be reusable, we have chosen UVM as methodology for environment and SystemVerilog as language for verification. Developing the scenarios in testcases and subsequently checkers for the same was carried out. Here DFT gaskets are On-chip clock controller and SRAM. Working of checkers is to compare the actual data expected data. Exceed application was used for connecting to server, Synopsys VCS was used for simulation and Synopsys Verdi tool for debugging.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060382","DFT Verification;Checkers;OCC;SRAM;System Verilog","Integrated circuits;Schedules;Systematics;Discrete Fourier transforms;Gaskets;Random access memory;Silicon","","","","","","15","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sugarcane infections are an issue in the sugar business because they can entirely kill diseased crops, causing financial loss to the farmers if not treated and diagnosed quickly. The study was prompted by the rapid evolution of disease classes and farmer's lack of disease diagnostic and recognition skills. To solve this challenge, machine learning techniques such as computer vision and deep learning can be applied. By separating and categorizing sugarcane images into two groups: healthy and unhealthy/diseased, the trained model is able to fulfill its goal. With a simple CNN with four discrete classes, the analysis shows an accuracy of 98.69% for sugarcane disease detection.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10059761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059761","Machine learning (ML);Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Sugarcane diseases","Deep learning;Computer vision;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Real-time systems;Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","20","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For agricultural system modelers, it is still difficult to anticipate coffee output with any degree of accuracy given the environmental, meteorological, and soil fertility factors that influence it. Out of the 103 different varieties of class coffee bean variation that are commercially traded worldwide, the two most significant types of coffee assortment filled in India are Arabica and Robust. In order to investigate and construct a predictive model for the development of coffee planters to make accurate judgments in time during bad conditions in advance, we are taking the most important plantation crop in India, namely, coffee. In order to quantify the effect of agronomic parameters to obtain a decent coffee yield, we thus present a framework for coffee yield prediction utilizing machine learning probabilistic techniques. Here, we take into account the historical dataset from the Central Coffee Research Institute (CCRI), Karnataka, for the year (2008-2019). We are taking into account agronomic elements like Age, Soil Nutrients: Organic Carbon (OC), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Alkaline (pH), and Respective Yield Obtained in Chikkamagaluru Region, Karnataka State, India, for the forecast of coffee yield. Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression are three different predictive regression algorithms that are used for prediction; the results of each are compared, examined, and tabulated. The best accurate coffee yield estimate during the autonomous testing phase was produced using an elastic net (ENET) regression model ($\mathrm{R}2=0.26$ kg ha 1, $\text{RMSE}=136.95$ kg ha 1, and $\text{MAE}=111.41$ kg ha 1). This contrasted with the less accurate Lasso regression model ($\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.25$ kg ha - 1, $\text{RMSE}=137.64$ kg ha−1 and $\text{MAE}=111.96$ kg ha - 1) and MLR ($\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.25$ kg ha−1, $\text{RMSE}=137.71$ kg ha−1 and $\text{MAE}= 112.02$ kg ha - 1). In this work, the ENET model replaces the Lasso and MLR models as an enhanced class of artificial intelligence models for smallholder farm coffee yield prediction.

The limitations of conventional V2V steering techniques are overcome by this new worldview of cross breed V2V-D2D communications. The proposed cross breed model reduces the end-to-end delay of message conveyance, as shown by the NS2 reproduction results. To demonstrate the improvements brought about by our solution compared to standard V2V procedures, a thorough examination of various D2D use cases (both the best and the most appallingly terrible scenarios) is presented.

Traditional vehicles are improved by a variety of technologies, including regenerative braking, auto-start and shut-off, and even more advanced technology. Affordable charging stations with state-of-the-art control algorithms are required to boost the charging efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs). An electronic regulator known as a “Battery Management System” (BMS) controls battery monitoring and protection, calculation of battery status, and potential user notification of that condition. Due to many faults in battery packs, EVs encounter a number of issues; it is essential to assess the battery's level of charge (SOC). Measurement of battery performance and health are part of battery cell monitoring. The ideas of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for battery management in new energy vehicles were initially presented to address the issue of protecting battery cells from over-current and over-voltage. Data is collected by applying multiline signals to one-of-a-kind dynamic charge and discharge test. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are helpful in state of charge (SOC) prediction challenges because they can record cell dynamics and store past data, both of which are necessary for predicting future charge levels.

Several image processing methods and leaf colour charts (LCC) have been developed by researchers, especially for predicting nitrogen nutrient concentration in plants. But there is no generalized technique to find the nutrient status of different plants. To accomplish this research gap, an examination is going on with parts of plant images by researchers. Therefore, the prediction of chlorophyll association with colour indices (PCACI) method is proposed to determine the relationship between chlorophyll content and colour indices. The average chlorophyll value (ACV) of five different crop leaves is initially measured. Simultaneously, the same leaves are captured to find the relationship with chlorophyll content. Because chlorophyll has a linear relationship with leaf nitrogen content. Two colour indices were introduced, namely intense greenness percentage (IGP) and intense green colour index (IGCI), which are extracted from leaf images in hexadecimal decimal (HD) format. The HD values are obtained by applying the k-means clustering algorithm to the captured leaf image dataset. Hexadecimal-based colour names are analyzed with leaf images and suggested to make a leaf colour chart for the mentioned crop leaves. Based on the evaluation of IGP and IGCI with ACV with different crop leaf images, the obtained results vary from crop to crop. Analyzing the correlation coefficient of ACV with IGP reveals a significant relationship with curry leaves, sapodilla, and tulsi leaves. But the linear relationship is acceptable only with curry leaves. While analyzing ACV with IGCI, it shows considerable association and a linear relationship with curry leaves and sapodilla. The result implies that the derived colour indices can be used for predicting the nitrogen content of some other crops after the proper analysis.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060282","Leaf images;Colour indices;Chlorophyll;LCC;Hexadecimal","Visualization;Correlation;Image color analysis;Plants (biology);Crops;Agriculture;Software","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

What happens in one part of the world has repercussions in other parts of the world. This is because the vast quantities of data produced by these platforms may be instantly disseminated to any part of the globe. To make cyber space as welcoming and productive as feasible for all users, developers of these platforms must overcome several obstacles. However, provocative speech and hate speech have emerged as major problems in recent years. The scale of this issue is so large that it cannot be solved by coordinated teamwork alone, no matter how hard people try. Actually, there is a need for the development of an automated approach that can identify and eliminate nasty and insulting remarks before they can do any damage. This paper offers a novel Deep Learning-based Hate Speech Detection Scheme (DL-HSDS) to identify hate speech in Twitter data. Even though there are a lot of HSDS methods available, many of them suffer from insufficient feature learning and poor dataset management, both of which negatively impact attack detection precision.

The iris, face, and finger vein biometric modalities are presented in this work as a new multimodal biometric human ID framework that depends on a deep learning calculation. The framework's design is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which concentrate highlights and utilize a SoftMax classifier to order photographs. Three CNN models - one for the iris, one for the face, and one for the finger vein - were incorporated to make the framework. The SDUMLA-HMT dataset, a multimodal biometrics dataset, was used in a number of experiments to empirically assess the presentation of the proposed framework. The results showed that employing three biometric features produced better results than using two or one biometric trait in biometric identification systems.

PC calculations are utilized by face recognition frameworks to pick specific, perceived perspectives on an individual's face. There should be a mutual component that shows the innate characteristics of the face that are free of the image modalities since a similar individual's face pictures from different picture modalities are connected to a similar face object. In this paper, a Mutual Component Analysis (MCA) is proposed and different element extraction strategies are likewise tried to contrast execution all together with construe the mutual components for reliable heterogeneous face recognition. A face ID strategy in view of thick framework histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) is proposed to catch facial highlights in complex circumstances sufficiently. The HOG highlights are first taken from the face picture after it has been isolated into a few thick lattices. Then, at that point, the closest neighbor classifier is utilized for recognition in the wake of making completely out of the framework HOG highlight vectors to understand the component appearance of the whole face. As per the trial discoveries, the thick matrix HOG approach is more fit to represent changes in time and climate. The thick matrix HOG and LBP both take about a similar measure of time to remove highlights. The thick lattice HOG approach, instead of the LBP, accomplishes a higher recognition rate while utilizing less aspects.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060178","Face recognition;Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG);Local Binary Pattern (LBP);Mutual component analysis","Histograms;Technological innovation;Face recognition;Government;Lattices;Transforms;Time measurement","","","","","","9","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proliferation of portable communication devices has raised the bar for system performance. The essential building blocks of every DSP system are the fundamental arithmetic units like adders and multipliers. The speed, power, and area performance of these blocks has an effect on the system as a whole. Arithmetic unit computation time can be lowered to improve system performance. Due to the concurrent computations performed by the Residue Number System (RNS), the circuits are faster and more suited for high-speed digital signal processing. Reversible logic (RL) is regarded as one of the power optimization strategies in low-power CMOS VLSI architecture. In this paper, Reversible logic is employed to implement basic operations such as addition multiplication, forward and reverse converter on RNS using three moduli set (5,3,2). All the implementations are done on Xillinx 14.7 platform. Results shows that forward converter uses 165 LUTs and operates at a lower frequency of 68MHz because of the accessibility to ROM. The reverse converter consumes more power 10.5mW compared to other circuits as it involves more of multiplication operations. The methodology applied can be used in power efficient DSP applications to achieve low power and high speed.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060538","Residue Number System (RNS);Reversible Logic (RL);Moduli set;Forward Converter;Reverse Converter","Performance evaluation;System performance;Digital signal processing;Very large scale integration;Frequency conversion;Table lookup;Performance analysis","","","","","","15","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through social media, a massive quantity of information is being released to the public. This massive amount of freely accessible data has several potential uses. This work aims to discourse issues with the social media dataset, such as its short text nature (with just 140 to 160 characters of text data), its continuous cyclosis nature, its use of abbreviations and slang, and the growing prevalence of sarcasm in online communications. Sentiment analysis and sarcasm recognition are two of the most important jobs in NLP. To communicate sarcasm, one must provide an outside element that reverses the positive and negative emotions involved. There is a risk that data mining efforts may be misclassified if they are fed sarcastic tweets. In this study, we provide a Recurrent Neural Network-based technique for analysing the tone of tweets (RNNs). The proposed approach combines a memory cell-level and network-level localization system for identifying sarcastic and non-sarcastic tweets with an attention mechanism designed to improve the network's performance. It uses an algorithm called Ring-Toss-Game-Based Optimization (RTGBO) to fine-tune the hyper-parameters. The primary focus of RTGBO is to provide a simulation of player behaviour and rules for the ring toss game. One distinguishing feature of the RTGBO procedure is that it has no tuning knobs. Since newspaper headlines often include sarcasm in an effort to draw in readers, the newspaper sarcasm dataset is used for this research. Existing methods are used to verify the suggested classifier in terms of a number of metrics. The model works quite well and accurately identifies which sentences are sarcastic and which are not.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060365","Natural Language;Sarcasm detection;Recurrent Neural Networks;Newspaper sarcasm dataset;Data Mining","Sentiment analysis;Recurrent neural networks;Text analysis;Social networking (online);Text recognition;Microprocessors;Blogs","","","","","","26","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking care of people's health without sacrificing their comfort is crucial, and preventing illness is a top responsibility. In this investigation, an accurate diagnosis and prognosis for the onset of diabetes mellitus were achieved by using an optimization and deep learning based approach. In this first step, error is eliminated from the dataset's input data by replicative derivative error normalization. Using a multivariate salp swarm optimization (MSSO) strategy, unique features may be retrieved from an artificial bound co-occurrence matrix (ABCM). Finally, artificial memory vector network (AMVN) classifier based on deep learning is used to classify/predict diabetes risk as part of the classification technique. In this research, genuine data from the University of California's website on Indians with diabetes were used for experimental purposes.

Green energy has recently become a top priority for experts in order to meet rising electricity demand. As a result, environmental organisations have promoted the utilization of RES like solar, wind and tidal energy as an alternative to fossil fuels for electricity generation. Due to current research and development in power electronics, wind and solar energy, in particular, have been reported to be more practical in large-scale deployment. In this paper, an efficient hybrid renewable energy system integrating solar and wind energy is proposed which utilizes a modified Sheppard Taylor converter. The converter performs regulation of output voltage under varying load and input voltage with negligible input current ripple. A fuzzy-PSO approach is exploited for the efficient tracking of maximum power to obtain optimized results with rapid speed of convergence and the PWM pulses generated provide optimal duty cycle to the converter switch. A grid connected $3\varphi$ VSI along with LC filter modelled by dq theory is utilized which converts the stationary abc axis into dq axis that rotates synchronously. The entire system is realized by MATLAB/SIMULINK and the efficient outputs are obtained with reduced THO of 0.86%.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060550","PV system;WECS;Modified Sheppard Taylor converter;Fuzzy-PSO approach;VSI;dq-theory","Renewable energy sources;Wind energy;Computational modeling;Solar energy;Active filters;Filtering theory;Mathematical models","","","","","","16","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The PAM control reduces switching losses by allowing the VSI to operate at the frequency determined by synchronous speed. At the front end, a bridgeless SEPIC provides a wide range of DC voltage to the VSI input. When compared to the topology with two separate inductors, the Bridgeless SEPIC coupled inductors reduce the overall component count and the self-inductance required. The converter is designed to operate in Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) by applying a simple voltage follower approach to a SEPIC converter to achieve inherent input current shaping over a wide speed range. The precise reference voltage for the DC link is calculated in the outer speed control loop. The proposed BLDC motor drive is modeled using the XSG design tool, and the controller is implemented in FPGA.

However, a wind farm with a doubly fed induction generator which is incorporated to the transmission line having a series compensation may give rise to the Sub Synchronous Resonance (SSR) issue. In a wind farm with series compensation, the SSR phenomena implies the potential concerns. The Sub synchronous control interaction issues have been caused due to the increased use of series compensation in DFIG-based wind farms. For SSCI, the non-periodic energy exchange amongst the network side and the generator side is the most significant cause. In this work, an investigation is performed on the applications of Gate-Controlled Series Capacitor (GCSC) and Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), which is a series linked FACTS device which can be used for series compensation in fixed speed wind turbine generator systems. The transmission line series impedance can be quickly controlled by the GCSC and used for SSR dampening. To validate the findings, the simulations studies is performed using MATLAB/SIMULINK.

However, most existing medical assistive devices are not widely accepted due to their expensive cost, laborious setup involving high-end electronic components, and discomfort. So, to address this issue in existing medical devices, we developed a cost-effective medical assistive device in the form of a shoe that can be accepted by anyone who is blind and allows them to live an independent life without relying on others.

A flame sensor detects the presence of fire within and around the user. An IR sensor is used to identify pits. This infrared sensor will assist the vision impaired in protecting themselves from falling into the pit. In addition, an accelerometer sensor is utilized to aid the ultrasonic sensor in alerting the user to impediments while walking alone, rather than while sleeping or sitting in the same posture for an extended length of time. All sensor output is indicated to visually impaired people via a buzzer, and messages are delivered to the caregiver via IoT. To reduce power usage and make use of existing natural resources, we are deploying solar panels that generate electricity from the sun, which is a renewable resource.

In this study, we will discuss the structure of a “Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)” and a data-gathering technique for FF detection in actual environments. The energy efficiency is crucial due to the “Sensor Node (SN)” constrained processing capability and minimum power battery. Extensive study is required to address these concerns. The SNs must be placed as closely together as feasible so that the whole forest can be monitored. Such an implementation strategy produces a crowded network environment in which SNs' coverage could intersect. To achieve the coverage goal, the basic requirement is to activate all SNs following installation. Together all SNs inside these overlapping areas are left “ON” which will reduce the lifespan of the network. Some of the SNs were put into an “Active-State (AS)” whereas others are left in a “Sleep-State (SS)” strategy that may be used to prolong the network's lifespan and preserve its coverage. Our study proposes a new protocol called the “Dynamic Optimized Time Scheduler (DOTS)” based on clustering to deal with the network lifespan problem from two angles. At first, the “Enhanced Sleeping Scheduler (ESS)” method is used to keep a small group of SNs in AS to guard the target while the rest of the SNs in the SS. The next will be for SNs to occasionally share the data they've collected locally with one another. The primary use of this concept is to update receivers only after an update has taken place. We examine the “Energy Efficiency”, “Packet Delivery Ratio”, “Throughput”, and “Routing Overhead” of the proposed DOTS protocol in comparison to the “Clustering-based Compression-Aggregation (CCA)” and the “Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA)” existing protocols in the WSN.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060020","Forest Fire;Wireless Sensor Networks;Energy Efficiency;Clustering;Scheduling","Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Clustering algorithms;Forestry;Spread spectrum communication;US Department of Transportation;Throughput","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, use the YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7 models to put these datasets for detection and classification on our CNN. As a means of evaluating the efficacy of our model, we have experimented with a number of different CNN topologies and tweaks. We put the model through its tests with YOLOv6 and YOLOv7. YOLOv5 achieved the best results among these models. The final result shows that the YOLOv6 model gives 86.24%, the YOLOv7 model gives 71.28% accuracy whereas YOLOv5 gives 89.97% accuracy in classifying the images in the training and testing sets which are best compared to the other two models.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060409","Tribal dress;Monipuri;Chakma;Convolution Neural Network (CNN)","Training;Computer science;Computational modeling;Clothing;Neural networks;Topology;Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, the datasets were used in two different forms for both training and testing. In the first set, raw data was used as it is, and the second set of data was used after normalizing the time series using the min-max concept (between 0 and 1). However, the normalized data were de-normalized for each period for performance metrics estimation. ThymeBoost is the best model for the first period of raw data and the second period of normalized data. In contrast, Prophet outperforms all other models for the normalized data in terms of all four measures. For the second period of raw data, no model emerged as the best model in terms of all performance metrics. Therefore, all three models performed similarly for the third period of raw and normalized data.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10059717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059717","precipitation;semi-arid region;ARIMA;Prophet;ThymeBoost","Training;Measurement;Precipitation;Social networking (online);Time series analysis;Estimation;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Infrared thermography is used as a nondestructive image acquisition sensor. So infrared imaging sensors are used to identify and classify different ice types formed on the rivers during winter season in western countries. However, you can observe blur and degradation in the acquired images through infrared imaging, as the climatic nature is involved in the process. These factors affect the quality of the image and also the quantitative analyses of the images. Especially, when there are deeper faults which are found in an under laying substance and high thermal conductivity materials can also be studied. Acquired infrared images are usually affected with noises. In this paper, de-noising of infrared images is carried out using convolution neural network model in deep learning. In this work Gaussian white noise is added to the infrared images with varying noise intensities from 1% to 10% and then the convolution neural network model is applied to de-noise the infrared images. In the qualitative analysis of the infrared images edge factor, uniform region, texture, smoothness, non-uniform region, structure of the region of interest is considered. For quantitative analysis, mean square error, peak-signal- noise-ratio and structure similarity index measure is used. The results of traditional methods of image de-noising are compared with convolution neural network based method. It is concluded from the experimental work that the convolution neural network based method proves to be better for removal of Gaussian white noise when compared with traditional methods.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060448","Image De-noising;infrared image;Gaussian White noise;convolution neural network;Deep Learning","Histograms;Image segmentation;Convolution;Statistical analysis;Noise reduction;Neural networks;Infrared imaging","","","","","","28","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One method that has existed for years is that of simulated phishing training, but it is thought that there needs to be a more engaging approach to this area of education. Gamification in phishing education is a more recent but not extremely well studied approach, which leads to the question – Which is better for phishing education of users, simulated phishing exercises or gamified phishing training? In this report, five research articles in each category are described and summarized, and then an analysis is conducted within the groups and between the two groups. The analysis is focused on quantitative metrics that appear in the selected research articles; there is a lesser focus on the qualitative analysis conducted in the reviewed reports.

Anomaly detection in data mining finds instances, occurrences, and observations that differ from a dataset's regular pattern of activity. Using the ECG dataset as input, the initial step in this method is signal pre-processing. High pass, low pass, and notch filters are used to de-noise ECG signals as part of the signal pre-processing. ECG signal de-noising is a significant pre-processing step that highlights the characteristic waves in ECG data while attenuating the disturbances. The emergence of the ECG signal coefficients from signal pre-processing is trained and tested in the second stage. The classification of the ECG signal using LSTM RNN Model is the final stage. Recurrent neural networks are artificial neural networks that use sequential data or time series data (RNN).

It is a cruel reality that many tend to ignore. This paper deals with how technology can be used to help people with certain physical/sensory impairments go about their daily lives. Sign language is an important form of communication not only for the people with auditory impairment, but also a tool for those with speech impairment. Sign language is often only understood by experts. Therefore, a sign language interpretation tool is necessary. Whereas, the visually impaired use a system of reading and writing called braille. However, braille is not common among those who are visually acute and it is a hassle to convert every text to braille manually. Our paper explores these two problems. The technology that can change the traditional communication system for the visually impaired people is converting text to audio. It is easy to convert printed text to audio, and it has been successfully done in the past decade. Apart from sign language interpreters, a fairly novel idea is to convert speech to sign language to help impaired people to gain more knowledge and experience. The above-mentioned technologies are expected to help greatly in the normal life of the physically impaired and this project can be further modified to fit any appropriate smart thing.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060238","Visual Impairments;Speech Impairment;Physical Impairment;Text to Speech (TTS);Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);Deep Learning","Deep learning;Computer science;Braille;Visualization;Communication systems;Bibliographies;Neural networks","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pre-processing aim is to screen the images in raw form and obtain better quality images after suitable transformation which is further used for the purpose of diagnosis and detection. This paper elaborates the comparisons of four nonlinear filters to remove the impulse noise. Pre-processing has been administered on images of pterygium collected from both private clinics and also images available from public dataset. The applied filters performance is measured using performance metrics Peak Signal to Noise Ratio and Mean Square Error. First ordered entropy also tried to assess the structural content of the pre-processed images. The obtained results justifies that, decision based median filter is found to be the better filter both in terms of high Peak Signal to Noise Ratio[PSNR] and low Mean Square Error[MSE]. The entropy values obtained after the application of filters is showed that the decision based median filter showed an average bit content value of 7.4 which is highest among other filters considered.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060421","Pterygium;Nonlinear filter;decision based median filter;PSNR;MSE","Image quality;PSNR;Cornea;Filtering;Measurement uncertainty;Nonlinear filters;Mean square error methods","","","","","","14","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we usage of air quality and weather forecast data to make predictions for the following 48 hours at each monitoring station. This work creates a feature selection-based classifier for forecasting based on expertise in the field of air pollution. Three forms of information-air contaminants, meteorological data, and weather data-are offered as prerequisites for making air quality forecasts. In order to facilitate more accurate categorization, the raw data are split and standardised during the pre-processing stage. Therefore, it is essential to identify the best characteristics from the pre-processed data and eliminate the extraneous ones that might lead to incorrect categorization. In this research, an unique optimization-based approach was used to pick features from coral reefs. An optimization approach called the coral reefs optimization (CRO) procedure is able to find optimal solutions by modelling coral behaviours relevant to reef location and development. Each possible solution to the issue is analogized to a coral that is always searching for a suitable spot in which to settle and flourish in the reefs in the suggested approach. At each stage, the solutions are processed with the help of the coral reefs optimization algorithm's unique operators. A better solution is more likely to flourish on the reefs after a number of iterations. The issue is solved by selecting the best solution. In the end, a Network is used to make predictions (DNN).

Many of the current sentiment analysis methods are seeking to extract the complicated semantic also, linguistic data from the message, however they are not especially applicable to the examination of understudy opinions. For the study of student message sentiment, the CNN-BiGRU-AT model—often referred to as a novel convolutional neural network with the bidirectional gated recurrent unit and an attention mechanism—is developed. The removal of n-gram information from each sentence is subsequently accomplished using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The sentences are then consecutively condensed through the bidirectional gated intermittent unit to dispose of the message's significant semantic data parts (BiGRU). The CNN-BiGRU model is then given a thinking mechanism, and by including the attention score, different learning loads are introduced to the model.

Based on the user requirement, a DC-DC converter is designed with a single or multiple output. For multiple outputs an isolated converter topology is must whereas for single output there is an option of using isolated topologies like Forward, Push-Pull, Flyback, Half bridge, Interleaved forward/ flyback, Full bridge etc. or simple non-isolated dc-dc converter topologies like buck or boost converter. Apart from considering complexity/ component count/ cost to finalize the topology, the requirement of ground isolation between power source and load end is very critical for some users to avoid ground noise induced problems, which may prompt the use of isolated topologies. In this paper, a detailed study & analysis, based on hardware results has been carried out for designing a single isolated output DC-DC converter for the output power requirement of 140W (28V/5A) operating at variable input voltage of 26V to 42V. Based on the literature survey, three isolated topologies, Half Bridge Converter, Push-Pull Converter and Interleaved Forward Converter have been shortlisted for hardware implementation & analysis. The advantages & disadvantages of all three topologies have been summarized and a comparison has been made based on hardware results. Parameters like efficiency, peak input current, maximum voltage stress on switch, switch power dissipation (both switching and conduction losses) and other important waveforms are analyzed in this paper for better understanding.

This is evident in the case of pandemic happened from January 2020 which is a result of corona virus. In early stages of covid-19 caused by corona virus, the symptoms are not severe and mostly cured through self-medication. In this situation, estimating the real spread based on the reports from various hospitals might be misleading. There might be lot of variation in the reports based on different types of measurements performed, and the tests conducted on only the symptomatic patients. In spite of all these constraints, a huge amount of covid-19 related data is published since 3 years and also updated on a daily basis. This serves as a motivation to consider various mathematical models to predict the course of change in an epidemic and result in effective control strategies. The challenge is to predict the peak and end of the epidemic together with its evolution through available incomplete data and intrinsic complexity. In this paper, time series models are proposed to analyze corona spread data and analyzing its impact based on gender, age and geographical location. The proposed algorithm leverages machine learning models to predict number of corona cases in the future. An early detection of spread of corona would help in stopping community transmission and this serves a major motivation for this research.

In this study, EMG signals collected during six distinct hand activities have been analysed by using statistical tests, such as the t-test, sign-rank test and the analysis of variance, to determine the degree to which specific properties vary. The hand movement under study was dumbbell up, dumbbell down and hand gripper with both hands i.e two sets of data for each movement. The results show that there is no such difference for the dumbbell activity considering either up or down movement except for a few features regardless of the hand used. Although the non-significant result was found for all features considering both left-hand griper and right-hand griper. But the majority of the features show there is enough evidence (p<0.05) showing significant difference when considering up and down movement for both hands' dumbbell activity.

These investigations have focused on the real-time detection of diseases in cotton leaf samples. Although Convolution Neural Networks have been a significant contributor to the categorization of plant diseases and the identification of those diseases, there is still much more work to be done to assist farmers and pathologists in accurately detecting and categorizing diseases. Manually inspecting crops for disease requires a significant investment of time and money and is a stressful process. An erroneous diagnosis can lead to incorrect conclusions, treatment that is ineffective, and increased costs.

Better classification outcomes are guaranteed if the right collection of features is used to identify emotion in online textual material. The computational difficulty of doing optimal feature selection drives the need for the development of creative approaches to enhancing classifier performance. In this work, an effective method for analyzing Twitter user sentiment was presented. A machine learning model was developed by the suggested method to identify good and negative tweets. Characteristics are extracted after pre-processing, and it's possible that include irrelevant features can lower classification accuracy. For this reason, the model implemented the Vortex Search Algorithm (VSA) to choose the best characteristics and discard the rest. The final tweets categorization is done using the Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm. A total of four Twitter datasets are used for the studies, each measuring a unique set of parameters and made accessible to the public.

It is responsible for loading class files, checking the code, interpreting them, and executing them. Whereas application is run as a thread inside the JVM. The garbage collector thread is launched by the JVM (when possible or necessary) without the user's intervention in order to free up utilized, unreferenced memory. In order to optimize memory and garbage collection settings and to troubleshoot memory-related problems, one has to analyze Garbage Collection logs. An application's overall performance while it is running is significantly impacted by garbage collection, an automated memory management system is vital for Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java Development Kit offers a number of garbage collectors from which the developer may choose while setting up the environment. There are several different kinds of garbage collectors, including Serial GC, Parallel GC, Z GC, and Garbage First GC. We investigate the operation of the GC in a defined environment, with the focus on serial and parallel GC. Throughput and latency are the main performance indicators used in the study. The findings of the study demonstrate that different applications need different garbage collector configurations. It is possible to improve latency levels. This study also demonstrates how GC parameters, namely adjusting the heap size and number of threads, will impact the performance and latency of an application, how different regression algorithms better suited for different use cases. This study will also investigate the effects of a set of optional GC settings in addition to the default setups on application performance, which is another part of its contribution. Finally, we will be able to anticipate the appropriate heap size needed for the applications smooth functioning, the required application duration, and the quantity of GC and Full GC events during the application's runtime.

When the security robot is linked to the internet through WiFi, the user may safely log in to the password-protected system module using a VNC server, see the live feed, and concurrently manoeuvre the robot and camera. The user may have a better perspective of the surroundings thanks to the pan-tilt camera movement. In order to prevent colliding with impediments, the robot mobility is designed in this way.

The designed system is used to capture real-time EEG signals utilizing Ag/AgCl electrodes and GNR@PVA electrodes. GNR@PVA electrodes with variable GNR ratios (0.5% and 1%) are designed by drop casting method. Real time EEG signals are acquired from 20 visually normal and 2 visually impaired individuals, parietal and optical lobe regions of brain. The acquired signals from parietal and optical lobe regions are associated with the beta and alpha frequencies of EEG waves. The obtained signals from the Ag/AgCl and GNR electrodes are compared with standard alpha and beta waves. The K-means machine learning algorithm is applied to compare the similarity between acquired EEG signal via GNR@PVA electrode and commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. 1% GNR electrode can acquire the alpha and beta signals of normal person with correlation coefficient of 0.99 and 0.93 respectively. Also 1% GNR electrode can be used to acquire the beta signals from blind people with correlation coefficient of 0.93.

Most women with breast cancer don't make it because the disease isn't detected early enough using today's best methods. Therefore, doctors and scientists are confronted with a significant challenge in recognizing breast cancer at an primary stage. We present a medical IoT-based diagnostic system that can distinguish between patients with cancer and those without it in an Internet of Things setting. Malignant vs benign categorization is performed using an unique transfer learning technique called BERT, which is based on a previously learned language model. In particular, this research looks at how well novel fine-tuning approaches based on transfer learning might improve BERT's capacity to capture significant context. This research improves the BERT model's classification accuracy by using a Black Widow-meta-heuristic Optimization (NBW-MHO) feature selection strategy to refine feature selection from the breast cancer dataset.

Dust deposition reduces efficiency by up to 60%, depending on the type and amount of the dust matter. For every 1-degree Celsius increase in the solar cell temperature, the electrical efficiency drops by 0.22%. Similarly, as sun irradiation increases by 100 W/m2, the solar cell temperature and output power grow by 3.82 °C and 3.14 W, respectively. PV module performance is susceptible to being impacted by direct or nearby (in the radius of 60 meters) lightning strikes.

Reliability and performance become another difficult task when technology production processes progressively scale down to minimise chip dia size. Network on Chip (NoC) is a frequent option in the creation of complicated applications to meet all these challenges in the most recent technological growth. In this study, hybrid approaches NoC are created to optimise the area, throughput, and power consumption. Due to the complexity of using a larger number of routers and the 8×8 dimensions of the NoC in this research project, power consumption is significantly higher with a lower packet delivery ratio. The data transmission between multiple devices in networks with the least amount of latency, memory usage, and power consumption is crucial. Buffered and buffer-less NoC are created utilising Dynamically Reconfigurable NoC (DR-NoC) and the Flexible Direction Order Routing (FDOR) scheme in order to adhere to these restrictions. The FDOR with Transition-Based Power Reduction Encoding (FDOR-TBPRE) Algorithm is presented in order to reduce static power. It can be easily skipped when there are no data or empty buffers, which reduces the dynamic power but leaves static power owing to more transitions in the incoming data. By minimising the amount of transitions in the incoming packets, FDOR-TBPRE is able to deliver higher performance in order to increase energy efficiency, eliminate input buffers, and resolve contention issues. On an 8×8 NoC, the FDOR-performance TBPRE's is verified in terms of power usage, latency, and PDR.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10059932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059932","NoC;Virtual Channel;FDOR;Processing element;TBPRE and streaming data","Performance evaluation;Power demand;Network topology;Throughput;Routing;Table lookup;System-on-chip","","","","","","15","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different design implementations of a full adder and half adder circuits have been used to produce an optimized multiplier circuit that incorporates pass transistor logic, Different multiplication algorithm strategies, such as Wallace tree multiplication, booth's algorithm, standard array multiplier, radix-4 multiplier technique, Vedic mathematics, Dadda's algorithm, and others, can also be utilized to create the multiplier. In this work we compare the result with power, delay and transistor count for different techniques and methods. One of the most efficient algorithms for low power and high speed architectures is the Dadda algorithm. The AND gate, half adder, and full adder circuits are the key building elements of the multiplier, resulting in a reduction in overall power consumption and latency. These major building blocks will be implemented using Hybrid (CMOS process and transmission gate logic) technique and GDI technique. The multiplier's efficiency will next be compared in terms of power dissipation, latency, and area using Cadence tools. And also the 4 bit multiplier is enhanced to 8 bit multiplier using the Dadda algorithm and this will be implemented in Xilinx ISE software using Verilog language and RTL schematic will be designed.","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10059592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059592","Dadda Algorithm;CMOS;HYBRID;GDI Multipliertechnique","Power demand;Software algorithms;Logic gates;Software;Mathematics;Power dissipation;Transistors","","","","","","15","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The training data is populated using a DSLR camera, calibrated illuminance meter, standard neutral patches, and controlled lighting in the darkroom. The RAW image files are processed using MATLAB, and the App Designer tool is used to develop the user interface. The model's performance is accessed under various illuminance levels and colour temperatures. The percentage error of prediction during testing by the model was less than 5.

The proposed work is created as a prototype to not only detect the face mask and sense the body temperature but also controlling the crowd inside a mall to maintain social distancing. Additionally, the system is strengthened by a sanitization module after entering to the mall. It is a single integrated solution to all the challenges consisting of all these four modules. Apart from malls, this system can be deployed in places like shops, banks, etc. Once the person is detected at the entry gate, the count of people inside the mall is checked to maintain the social distancing norms. If found a less number of people are inside, it checks for a face mask and body temperature. When all three conditions are satisfied, it opens the door and activates the sanitization module. This system uses a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for face detection, the MLX90614 temperature sensor for temperature sensing, and a servo motor for door control. All the modules are integrated with Raspberry-pi. The system is tested for all possible conditions and results are produced.

Over the last few decades, machine reading has become a reality. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the most successful technology in this field. Handwritten or printed text recognition by the machine is termed as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The demand for automatic character recognition systems has been increasing day by day and it can be seen in various forms like printed text or typed text as well as the handwritten one. This information can be further reprocessed for various applications and can be embedded with visual clues to enhance its usability in various applications. The optical character recognition is one such way, which can extract the information from printed documents. However, there are various technical challenges in accessing the data that is much worn out, old or specific to an object. A system trained on a particular model cannot inter-operate with other data, as there is no uniformity. The font size to writing style are specific to a person. Therefore, it is imperative to find a model that is universally accepted. In this paper, the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as a machine-learning tool to classify the Devanagari characters is proposed. The automation provided by the deep learning models is utilized to eliminate the feature extraction step. The experimentation is done with various architectures of CNN with varying depth and structures and comparison has been done with various state of art methods like VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNet, ResNet50 and Xception etc. using transfer learning of pre-trained weights.

This paper introduces a deep learning-based hybrid model having Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) that has been used to localize the faulty line in a multi-bus electrical power system network. This model is fully automated and achieves high accuracy with better reliability because no pre-processing or manual intervention is involved as in the case of machine learning.

Formal specifications have less probability of producing an implementation that does not meet the client's requirements. To confirm that the implementation that is to be deployed in the real world, meets the client's requirements, it is essential to test it.

Traditional multi-slice MRI reconstruction relies on coil sensitivity map and structured K-space sampling.

Abundant spatial and temporal characteristics are contained in human walking for indicating unique personal identity. There have been a large number of existing gait recognition approaches achieving good performance via the analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics. However, most of them directly concatenate the separately extracted temporal features and spatial ones for gait recognition, rarely considering the overall spatiotemporal structure and the inner connection between them. Therefore, we establish a Multi-Level Fine-tuned Transformer trained on sequential gait data, to capture and analyze the overall spatiotemporal information for gait recognition. Specifically, we first design a point-level spatial feature extractor for spatial feature extraction of frames of the gait sequence, based on typical Transformer architecture with positional encoding and multi-head self-attention mechanism. Subsequently, a frame-level temporal feature extractor is employed for the overall spatiotemporal features by learning dynamic information of the extracted spatial features from frames. Moreover, fine-tuned strategy is followed in the process of model training, to profoundly explore intra-frame spatial information, as well as global spatiotemporal features of the whole walking sequence. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets (normal and abnormal gait) show promising classification results, compared with several state-of-the-art techniques.","","978-1-6654-9182-2","10.1109/VRHCIAI57205.2022.00021","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62106117); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2021QF084); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062922","gait recognition;gait sequences;spatiotemporal;Transformer network;positional encoding","Legged locomotion;Training;Solid modeling;Virtual reality;Feature extraction;Transformers;Encoding","","","","","","29","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle these problems, in this work we propose a fresh framework named Siamese Attentive Convolutional Network (SACNet) for effective RS image change detection. Technically, our proposed framework first utilizes a Siamese Fully Convolutional Network (SFCN) as the encoding stage for multi-scale feature extraction from bitemporal RS images. To improve the representation ability, we propose a Fusing Attention Module (FAM) to highlight and aggregate multi-level attentive features from the SFCN. Besides, to capture more contextual information, we also sequentially introduce an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module and a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module to enlarge the receptive field and select the channel-refined features. As for the decoding stage, we introduce a Difference Attention Module (DAM) to select more discriminative features for the CD map prediction. The resulting structure can fully utilize the difference information to enforce the detection of change regions. Finally, we apply deep supervision on the multi-level side-outputs to achieve a better model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on three public remote sensing image CD benchmarks.

In this paper, we mainly studies image layered style transfer technology and propose a new style transfer algorithm that can highlight the details of the ROI in the image by introducing the color transfer Reinhard algorithm which can enrich the diversity of style transfer methods and provide people with new creative methods.","","978-1-6654-9182-2","10.1109/VRHCIAI57205.2022.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062942","image processing;convolutional neural network;style transfer;Reinhard algorithm","Human computer interaction;TV;Social networking (online);Image color analysis;Virtual reality;Internet;Artificial intelligence","","","","","","8","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Climate change and urbanization have increased the frequency or intensity of floods in recent years, and the resulting casualties and economic losses have also increased significantly. With the rapid development of computing power, flood forecast models based on machine learning have gradually emerged. These models that are trained on historical data contain rich information, which is conducive to the analysis and utilization of data. Compared to the traditional physical flood forecasting model, machine-learning-based models can obtain more satisfactory performance. To demonstrate recent advances in flood prediction, this paper presents an overview of recent flood prediction methods using machine learning. We classifier the model based on various strategies and list a variety of recent work in flood prediction. Furthermore, we review the evaluation indexes and compare the pros and cons of different models, hoping to present insights and motivations for future research directions.","","978-1-6654-9182-2","10.1109/VRHCIAI57205.2022.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062944","flood forecast;machine learning;evaluation indexes","Climate chanbge;Floods;Machine learning;Performance evaluation;Indexes;Predictive models","","","","","","29","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, the problem is that it is difficult for people to understand the internal logical structure of the system, and the machine learning model has become a black box. Lack of explanation is not only a practical problem, but also an ethical problem. At this point, understanding why a model makes a prediction is as important as the accuracy of the prediction. In order to balance the interpretability and accuracy of the model, many experts and scholars have done a lot of research on improving the interpretability of machine learning model, improved the interpretability of the model from different dimensions, and created a series of interpretable methods to help users understand the internal logic of the system and make the black box transparent. However, the current interpretability research is still in the stage of development, and there is no completely unified interpretable method at present. In this paper, firstly, the development status of machine learning and the importance of interpretable learning are discussed. Then, according to the current research status, interpretable methods are introduced from interpretable models and model independent categories, the research and application in the field of interpretability are discussed, and the current challenges and future development of interpretability are analyzed, To further promote the research and development of interpretability.","","978-1-6654-9182-2","10.1109/VRHCIAI57205.2022.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062911","machine learning;interpretable methods;interpretability;black box component","Human computer interaction;Solid modeling;Analytical models;Ethics;Machine learning;Virtual reality;Predictive models","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the traditional NMS algorithm is not suitable for text detection in natural scenes, especially for long texts and dense texts. In this paper, we observe that the coordinates of candidate bounding boxes are presented in skew distribution. On this observation, an improved NMS algorithm called SD-NMS (Skew Distribution NMS) is designed. First, the mode and the median of the coordinate set are counted to filter out the redundant bounding boxes. Then the left bounding boxes are merged for the location of the text regions. The SD-NMS method improves the detection ability of the model without extra model training and can be easily embedded in text detection methods. The experimental results show that our method obtains F-measure more than other NMS methods in public data sets ICDAR2015 and MSRATD500.","","978-1-6654-9182-2","10.1109/VRHCIAI57205.2022.00043","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62166040,U1803261,61603323); Natural Science Foundation of XinJiang(grant numbers:2021D01C057); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062875","non-maximum suppression algorithm;text detection;skew distribution","Training;Human computer interaction;Solid modeling;Object detection;Virtual reality;Filtering algorithms;Artificial intelligence","","","","","","18","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in judging whether the pig behavior is abnormal, it mainly depends on the intuition and experience of the breeder. This method not only consumes a lot of time and energy, and the accuracy is not high. Based on deep learning theory. Firstly, abnormal data of homogeneous sensors are removed and corrected based on Grubbs criterion, and a multi-head neural network is proposed, which are constructed to extract features from multi-sensor data and their weights are fully shared.

However, how to make the method generic across scenes has always been a challenging task. A good idea is to introduce 2D features of the single-view image of the scene as prior knowledge for adaptive modeling. In this paper, we are dedicated to exploring ways to better integrate multi-view image features and model this prior knowledge with inquired novel target views. Our framework innovatively adopts a transformer encoder to fuse multi-view features as global memory, and this global memory will be further input into the transformer decoder to get the more effective features conditioned on the target view as a query. This feature acts as prior knowledge to guide the model to become a general neural radiation field. Extensive experiments are carried out both on category-specific and category-agnostic benchmarks. The results show that TransNeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance and is superior to the earlier novel view synthesis methods, whether single-view input or multi-view input.","","978-1-6654-9182-2","10.1109/VRHCIAI57205.2022.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062881","Novel view synthesis;Neural Radiance Fields;Vision transformer;3D implicit reconstruction","Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality;Benchmark testing;Transformers;Rendering (computer graphics)","","","","","","15","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a Coordinate Attention Grasping and Pushing Network (Ca-GPNet) to learn synergistic grasping and pushing strategies in cluttered environments. We use both fully convolutional networks to predict actions: One predicts the grasping direction and position of the gripper, and the other predicts the initial push position and direction of the gripper. We propose to use the coordinate attention module to capture position information of objects along the horizontal and vertical directions of space and aggregate the features. The attention module extracts long-range interdependencies in one dimension while keeping the information about the location of objects in the another dimension. Then a pair of attention maps that perceive the location and orientation features of objects are generated to reinforce the perception of objects' locations by the network. The grasping success rate of the system is 73.7% and 71.4% of the action efficiency in the simulation. Our approach can be applied to real-world pushing and grasping tasks. Ca-GPNet grasping success rate is 79.2% and action efficiency is 75.3 % in the real world. Compared with baseline methods, our system can rapidly learn the pushing and grasping cooperative policy in a cluttered environment, with higher sample efficiency, grasping success rate and action efficiency.","","978-1-6654-9182-2","10.1109/VRHCIAI57205.2022.00034","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062915","robots;coordinate attention;clutter","Human computer interaction;Solid modeling;Federated learning;Robot kinematics;Grasping;Virtual reality;Feature extraction","","","","","","16","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
