Hence, techniques for modeling the functional relationships between various input features in the parameter space and application performance are important. We show that simple statistical inference techniques are inadequate to capture these relationships. Even with more complex ensembles of models, the minimum coverage of the parameter space required via experimental observations is still quite large. We propose a deep learning based approach that can combine information from exhaustive observations collected at a smaller scale with limited observations collected at a larger target scale. The proposed approach is able to accurately predict performance in the regimes of interest to performance analysts while outperforming many traditional techniques. In particular, our approach can identify the best performing configurations even when trained using as few as 1% of observations at the target scale.

Compiler-based FI frameworks inject faults at a high intermediate-representation level. However, they are less accurate than machine code, binary-level FI because they lack access to all dynamic instructions, thus they fail to mimic certain fault manifestations. In this paper, we study the limitations of current practices in compiler-based FI and how they impact the interpretation of results in resilience studies. We propose REFINE, a novel framework that addresses these limitations, performing FI in a compiler backend. Our approach provides the portability and efficiency of compiler-based FI, while keeping accuracy comparable to binary-level FI methods. We demonstrate our approach in 14 HPC programs and show that, due to our unique design, its runtime overhead is significantly smaller than state-of the-art compiler-based FI frameworks, reducing the time for large FI experiments.

However, in order for such Near-Data Processing (NDP) memory stacks to be used for different GPU architectures, it is desirable to standardize the NDP architecture. Our proposal enables this standardization by allowing data to be spread across multiple memory stacks as is the norm in high-performance systems without an MMU on the NDP stack. The keys to this architecture are the ability to move data between memory stacks as required for computation, and a partitioned execution mechanism that offloads memory-intensive application segments onto the NDP stack and decouples address translation from DRAM accesses. By enhancing this system with a smart offload selection mechanism that is cognizant of the compute capability of the NDP and cache locality on the host processor, system performance and energy are improved by up to 66.8% and 37.6%, respectively.

Sympiler takes advantage of these properties to symbolically analyze sparse codes at compile time and to apply inspector-guided transformations that enable applying low-level transformations to sparse codes. As a result, the Sympiler-generated code outperforms highly-optimized matrix factorization codes from commonly-used specialized libraries, obtaining average speedups over Eigen and CHOLMOD of $3.8 \times$ and $1.5 \times$ respectively.

Existing meshing algorithms were proposed with the assumption that computer memory is volatile. Consequently, for failure recovery, the in-core algorithms need to save memory states as snapshots with slow file I/Os. The out-of-core algorithms store octants on disks for persistence. However, neither of them was designed to leverage unique characteristics of non-volatile byte-addressable memory (NVBM). In this paper, we propose a novel data structure P ersistent M erged octree (PM-octree) for both meshing and in-memory storage of persistent octrees using NVBM. It is a multi-version data structure and can recover from failures using its earlier persistent version stored in NVBM. In addition, we design a feature-directed sampling approach to help dynamically transform the PM-octree layout for reducing NVBM-induced memory write latency. PM-octree has been successfully integrated with Gerris software for simulation of fluid dynamics. Our experimental results with real-world scientific workloads show that PM-octree scales up to 1.1 billion mesh elements with 1000 processors on the Titan supercomputer.

To address the above problems with hang detection, this paper presents ParaStack, an extremely lightweight tool to detect hangs in a timely manner with high accuracy, negligible overhead with great scalability, and without requiring the user to select a timeout value. For a detected hang, it provides direction for further analysis by telling users whether the hang is the result of an error in the computation phase or the communication phase. For a computation-error induced hang, our tool pinpoints the faulty process by excluding hundreds and thousands of other processes. We have adapted ParaStack to work with the Torque and Slurm parallel batch schedulers and validated its functionality and performance on Tianhe-2 and Stampede that are respectively the world’s current 2nd and 12th fastest supercomputers. Experimental results demonstrate that ParaStack detects hangs in a timely manner at negligible overhead with over 99% accuracy. No false alarm is observed in correct runs taking 66 hours at scale of 256 processes and 39.7 hours at scale of 1024 processes.

However, the metadata’s organization itself, which is organized using a directory tree structure, does not fit the key-value access pattern, thereby limiting the performance. To address this issue, we propose a distributed file system with a loosely-coupled metadata service, LocoFS, to bridge the performance gap between file system metadata and key-value stores. LocoFS is designed to decouple the dependencies between different kinds of metadata with two techniques. First, LocoFS decouples the directory content and structure, which organizes file and directory index nodes in a flat space while reversely indexing the directory entries. Second, it decouples the file metadata to further improve the key-value access performance. Evaluations show that LocoFS with eight nodes boosts the metadata throughput by 5 times, which approaches 93% throughput of a single-node key-value store, compared to 18% in the state-of-the-art IndexFS.","2167-4337","978-1-4503-5114-0","","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; China Association for Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926246","Key-value stores;File systems management;Distributed storage;Distributed architectures","Limiting;File systems;High performance computing;Organizations;Computer architecture;Metadata;Throughput","distributed databases;meta data;tree data structures","LocoFS;directory index nodes;file metadata;key-value access performance;single-node key-value store;loosely-coupled metadata service;distributed file system;scalable metadata service;directory tree structure;key-value access pattern;file system metadata","","","","55","","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we investigate possible methods to apply the SDN technology on the current generation HPC interconnects with the Dragonfly topology, and compare the performance of SDN with that of adaptive routing.

We focus on data race detection in programs written in OpenMP, the popular parallel programming model for multi-threaded applications. In particular, DataRaceBench includes a set of microbenchmark programs with or without data races. These microbenchmarks are either manually written, extracted from real scientific applications, or automatically generated optimization variants. We also define several metrics to represent effectiveness and efficiency of data race detection tools. Using DataRaceBench and its metrics, we evaluate four different data race detection tools: Helgrind, ThreadSanitizer, Archer, and Intel Inspector. The evaluation results show that DataRaceBench is effective to provide comparable, quantitative results and discover strengths and weaknesses of the tools being evaluated.

Although these approaches can reduce power consumption, we believe that they might not be sufficient to reach the exascale energy-efficiency goals. Hence, we aim to adopt techniques from embedded systems, where energy-efficiency has always been the fundamental objective. A successful energy-saving technique used in embedded systems is to integrate fine-grained autotuning with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.

The TBF enforces Remote Procedure Call (RPC) rate limitations based on (potentially complex) Quality of Service (QoS) rules. The QoS rules are enforced in Lustre’s Object Storage Servers, where each request is assigned to an automatically created QoS class.The proposed QoS implementation for Lustre enables various features for each class including the support for high-priority and real-time requests even under heavy load and the utilization of spare bandwidth by less important tasks under light load. The framework also enables dependent rules to change a job’s RPC rate even at very small timescales.

Multilevel checkpointing improves C/R efficiency by saving most checkpoints to fast compute-node local storage. But it incurs a high cost for writing a few checkpoints to slow global-I/O. We show that leveraging NDP to offload writing of checkpoints to global- I/O improves C/R efficiency. We explore additional opportunities using NDP to further reduce C/R overhead and evaluate checkpoint compression using NDP as a starting point. We evaluate the performance of our novel application of NDP for C/R and compare it to existing C/R optimizations. Our evaluation for a projected exascale system using multilevel checkpointing shows that with NDP, the host processor is able to increase its efficiency on an average from 51% to 78% (i.e., a >50% speedup in performance).","2167-4337","978-1-4503-5114-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926124","","Checkpointing;Costs;High performance computing;Writing;Data processing;Hardware;Optimization","checkpointing;parallel processing;software fault tolerance","HPC systems;system mean time;checkpoints;smaller time;multilevel checkpointing;compute-node local storage;leveraging NDP;checkpoint compression;projected exascale system","","","","52","","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the performance is severely impaired by redundant efforts in achieving crash consistency in both file system and disk cache. Therefore, we propose a new mechanism called transactional NVM disk cache (Tinca). In brief, Tinca jointly guarantees consistency of file system and disk cache and removes the performance penalty of file system journaling with a lightweight transaction scheme. Evaluations confirm that Tinca significantly outperforms state-of-the-art design by up to $2.5 \times$ in local and cluster tests without causing any inconsistency issue.

To improve diagnostic insight, we sample the distribution of program path costs and retain k representative paths. We describe scalable algorithms to collect representative paths and path profiles. To collect full paths efficiently, we introduce path pruning that reduces permanent space requirements from a trace (proportional to ranks and MPI events) to path length (the minimum). To make space requirements independent of ranks and events – even a small constant in practice – we profile program paths. Avoiding the limitations of prior path profiling approaches, we dynamically discover tasks and attribute costs in high resolution. We evaluate our algorithms on seven applications scaled up to 7000 MPI ranks. Full program paths use as little as 0.01% the permanent space of current methods; profiles require a nearly constant 100–1000KB.

However, without optimizations to distribute control overhead, scalability is often poor. Performance on distributed-memory machines is especially sensitive to communication and synchronization in the program, and thus optimizations for these machines require an intimate understanding of a program’s memory accesses. Control replication achieves particularly effective and predictable results by leveraging language support for first-class data partitioning in the source programming model.

Even with a detailed profile from a performance tool, writing or refactoring a program to remove its performance issues is still a daunting task for application programmers: it demands lots of program optimization expertise that is often system specific. Vendors often provide some detailed optimization guides to assist programmers in the process. However, these guides are frequently hundreds of pages long, making it difficult for application programmers to master and memorize all the rules and guidelines and properly apply them to a specific problem instance. In this work, we develop a framework named Egeria to alleviate the difficulty. Through Egeria, one can easily construct an advising tool for a certain high performance computing (HPC) domain (e.g., GPU programming) by providing Egeria with a optimization guide or other related documents for the target domain. An advising tool produced by Egeria provides a concise list of essential rules automatically extracted from the documents. At the same time, the advising tool serves as a question-answer agent that can interactively offers suggestions for specific optimization questions. Egeria is made possible through a distinctive multi-layered design that leverages natural language processing techniques and extends them with knowledge of HPC domains and how to extract information relevant to code optimization Experiments on CUDA, OpenCL, and Xeon Phi programming guides demonstrate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the usefulness of Egeria for HPC.

We develop miniapps for fast prototyping and optimizations. We implement new containers in structure-of-arrays data layout to facilitate vectorizations by the compilers. Further speedup and smaller memory-footprints are obtained by computing data on the fly with the vectorized routines and expanding single-precision use.

One classical approach consists in computing statistics on the outputs from well-chosen multiple simulation runs. Simulation results are stored to disk and statistics are computed postmortem. Even if supercomputers enable to run large studies, scientists are constrained to run low resolution simulations with a limited number of probes to keep the amount of intermediate storage manageable. In this paper we propose a file avoiding, adaptive, fault tolerant and elastic framework that enables high resolution global sensitivity analysis at large scale. Our approach combines iterative statistics and in transit processing to compute Sobol’ indices without any intermediate storage. Statistics are updated on-the-fly as soon as the in transit parallel server receives results from one of the running simulations. For one experiment, we computed the Sobol’ indices on 10M hexahedra and 100 timesteps, running 8000 parallel simulations executed in 1h27 on up to 28672 cores, avoiding 48TB of file storage.

Specialized hardware accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execution of DNN algorithms for high-performance and energy efficiency. Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars. Soft errors caused by high-energy particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can lead to catastrophic failures in DNN systems. Traditional methods for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are agnostic of the DNN algorithm and the DNN accelerator’s architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteristics of DNN systems (i.e., DNN software running on specialized accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a DNN system depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers in the design. Based on our observations, we propose two efficient protection techniques for DNN systems.","2167-4337","978-1-4503-5114-0","","Science and Engineering Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926241","Deep Learning;Silent Data Corruption;Soft Error;Reliability","Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Software algorithms;Redundancy;Software;Real-time systems","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radiation hardening (electronics);redundancy","specialized accelerators;error resilience;DNN system;error propagation;neural networks;machine learning problems;specialized hardware accelerators;DNN algorithm;energy efficiency;safety-critical systems;high-energy particles;hardware systems;DNN accelerator;DNN software","","","","61","","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on the Southwell iterative method, which is sequential, where only the equation with the largest residual is relaxed per iteration. The Parallel Southwell method extends this idea by relaxing equation i if it has the largest residual among all the equations coupled to variable i. Since communication is required for processes to exchange residuals, this method in distributed memory can be expensive. Distributed Southwell uses a novel scheme to reduce this communication of residuals while avoiding deadlock. Using test problems from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, we show that Distributed Southwell requires less communication to reach the same accuracy when compared to Parallel Southwell. Additionally, we show that the convergence of Distributed Southwell does not degrade like that of Block Jacobi when the number of processes is increased.","2167-4337","978-1-4503-5114-0","","U.S. Department of Energy; Office of Science; Advanced Scientific Computing Research; National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center; Office of Science; U.S. Department of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926239","iterative methods;sparse linear systems;Jacobi;Gauss-Seidel;Southwell;multigrid;reducing communication;one-sided MPI;remote memory access","Jacobian matrices;Costs;Smoothing methods;High performance computing;Memory management;System recovery;Iterative methods","approximation theory;iterative methods;Jacobian matrices","relaxing equation;distributed memory;Block Jacobi;low communication costs;Southwell iterative method;parallel southwell method","","","","19","","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional coprocessor model forces programmers to manually route messages through the host CPU. Other models allow GPU-initiated communication, but are inefficient for small messages. To enable fine-grain PGAS-style communication between threads executing on different GPUs, we introduce Gravel. GPU-initiated messages are offloaded through a GPU-efficient concurrent queue to an aggregator (implemented with CPU threads), which combines messages targeting to the same destination. Gravel leverages diverged work-group-level semantics to amortize synchronization across the GPU’s data-parallel lanes. Using Gravel, we can distribute six applications, each with frequent small messages, across a cluster of eight GPU-accelerated nodes. Compared to one node, these applications run 5.3x faster, on average. Furthermore, we show Gravel is more programmable and usually performs better than prior GPU networking models.

As a result, data objects of the application must be carefully placed to NVM and DRAM for best performance. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight runtime solution that automatically and transparently manage data placement on HMS without the requirement of hardware modifications and disruptive change to applications. Leveraging online profiling and performance models, the runtime characterizes memory access patterns associated with data objects, and minimizes unnecessary data movement. Our runtime solution effectively bridges the performance gap between NVM and DRAM.

This chapter discusses particle swarm optimization (PSO) method in the context of big data analytics. PSO has been used in the analysis of large data sets. The parameters of PSO can have a major influence on the performance of the PSO. The parameters include number of particles, number of iterations, velocity components and acceleration coefficients. A huge amount of particles may increase the computational complexity. Similarly, a low number of iterations may prematurely stop the iteration. The velocity components tend to provide a memory of flight directions. The acceleration coefficients measure the performance of the particles relative to past performances.","","9781119229056","10.1002/9781119229070.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821488.pdf&bkn=9820800&pdfType=chapter","","Optimization;Metaheuristics;Costs;Particle swarm optimization;Linear programming;Genetic algorithms;Big Data","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Today, the management of an IoT server is no longer handled solely by the end user, as was the case a few years ago. Nowadays, the owners of immense banks of servers sell/rent out services and become suppliers of higherlevel computer services which relieves end users of handling the hardware and software maintenance of the servers, optimization of the hard and soft resources needed for their applications, security and duplication of data on other remote servers arranged and distributed in the form of a “server farm” or what is known as a “Cloud”.","","9781119426486","10.1002/9781119426639.ch15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821160.pdf&bkn=9820807&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Internet of Things;Space heating;Protocols;Hardware;Task analysis;Software maintenance","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The boundary effect points affect the shape of the spline function. This may lead to different IMFs. The application of the traditional EMD and the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to profile analysis is based on the assumption that a signal's oscillation is univariate.

Sensors to detect physical values ‐ for which the recorded data are mainly analog ‐ are directly built into the Thing in the form of standalone integrated circuits or directly embedded on the Thing's single chip. RF links are very commonly employed in the case of so‐called “wearable” communicating Things, which seek a local mini base station/gateway with uplink directly to the Internet. NFC is well known for its applications and its use in all smartphones on the market. Its possibilities to be used with Internet of Things (IoT) are many, both direct and indirect.

For many complex data sets, especially rail track monitoring, the number of possible hypotheses is very large, and the talk of generating useful ones becomes extremely difficult. The data can be streamed in high dimensions, which can cause the “curse of dimensionality” problems. There is a need to extract robust, qualitative information and gain insight into the processes that generated the data in the first place. TDA is more effective in detecting large and small patterns in data compared with traditional principal component analysis (PCA) or cluster analysis. The aim of persistent homology is to measure the lifetime of certain topological properties of a simplicial complex when simplices are added or removed from it. TDA has unlimited applications in: axle box acceleration analysis; and other signal processing applications.","","9781119229056","10.1002/9781119229070.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821178.pdf&bkn=9820800&pdfType=chapter","","Topology;Shape;Feature extraction;Data mining;Data analysis;Strain;Visualization","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The energy‐harvesting systems provide very small quantities of electrical current to low‐consumption electronic circuits, using energy sources present in the environment. Thus, essentially, they are “batteryless” systems where energy harvesting is the process whereby the energy needed for operation is drawn from external sources in infinitesimal quantities, and then stored to allow devices to operate on battery power. Battery‐assisted systems are lightweight, mobile Things operating on battery power, whose quantity of energy is known generally expressed in Amp hours (Ah), or more specifically in coulombs, meaning a known battery life depending on the Thing's peak consumption and average consumption.","","9781119426486","10.1002/9781119426639.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821226.pdf&bkn=9820807&pdfType=chapter","","Batteries;Costs;Power supplies;Prototypes;Energy harvesting;Energy consumption;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

With the copula approach, the modeling of infrastructure data can be divided into various steps: modeling the marginal distributions, modeling the dependence structure between marginal distributions, identification of joint distribution, identification of the copula and its parameters, and comparisons of the performance of different joint distributions. Archimedean copulas are the most popular copulas and have a wide range of applications. Nested copulas are another approach used to build multivariate copulas. The bivariate Archimedean copulas can be extended to the d‐dimensional case. Standard multivariate copulas have the following problems: they can be inflexible in high dimensions, and they do not allow dependency structures between pairs of variables.

Tensor factorization and decomposition are becoming major tools for large multidimensional data analysis. The application of the tensor, apart from addressing the previous shortcomings, will provide a platform for performing data mining applications. The two most widely used tensor decomposition models are the Tucker model and the canonical decomposition (CANDECOMP) model. The aim of nonnegative tensor is to extract the data‐dependent nonnegative basis function, and the target data can be expressed by the linear and non‐linear combination of the nonnegative components.

Bayesian inference is conceived under the assumption that all the unknown parameters are random variables and their probability distributions denote the beliefs about their values. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is one of the computational methods that have been applied widely in Bayesian inference. In Bayesian statistics, one needs to evaluate the likelihood function in order to obtain the posterior. Unfortunately, in some cases the likelihood function is either mathematically difficult to deal with, does not exist, or the computational cost to evaluate it is expensive. In such situations, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), otherwise known as likelihood‐free computation, is an approximate method to use. The rejection algorithm involves the generation of samples from a probability distribution. This chapter shows selected examples of Bayesian analysis in railway track engineering applications.","","9781119229056","10.1002/9781119229070.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821357.pdf&bkn=9820800&pdfType=chapter","","Bayes methods;Probability distribution;Approximation algorithms;Task analysis;Proposals;Parameter estimation;Mathematical models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

ML is broadly understood as a group of methods that analyze data and make useful discoveries and inferences from the data. It relies heavily on techniques and theory from statistics, optimization, algorithms, and biologically inspired systems. ML can be classified into four groups: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi‐supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The semi‐supervised learning methods come from a collection of cases where only parts of them have assigned labels. Processing railway track data is becoming more complex. Kernel methods are an example of the ML techniques that are very effective for feature extraction. Kernel methods use kernel techniques to implicitly map input patterns to a feature space.

The nonparametric model assumes that the data distribution cannot be defined in terms of such a finite set of parameters. The model complexity grows with the amount of data. This is therefore a memory‐based approach. There are two broad approaches: Dirichlet process (DP), and Gaussian process (GP). The Dirichlet distribution (DD) is the multivariate generalization of the beta distribution. It can be conceptualized as a probability distribution of probability mass functions (PMFs). DP is also the continuous case of the DD. The Bayesian nonparametric approach is naturally set to analyze a combination of different track defects, like ties, tie plates, and rail anchors, as a mixture of components or a missing or broken fastener algorithm based on machine vision.","","9781119229056","10.1002/9781119229070.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821303.pdf&bkn=9820800&pdfType=chapter","","Bayes methods;Random variables;Mathematical models;Geometry;Data models;Stochastic processes;Rail transportation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In terms of the number of Things and IoT connections, Western Europe will lead the way, with 400% progression by 2021. This phenomenon will be due to the recent evolutions in legislation in the field of communicating energy meters, and to the EC's demand regarding the eCall initiative for connected vehicles. Every innovation/technological product is believed to obey a hype cycle, made up of five key phases in terms of visibility and maturity: technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment and plateau of productivity.

Most of the data in railway track engineering are contained in the form of relational database management and are either in the form of structured query language (SQL) or non‐SQL management systems. There are a few examples of this, including track data management system (TDMS), which is the collection of geometry data that can be used, among other things, to perform basic statistical analysis and visualization of the defects. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) looks at the data in different ways to detect or explore interesting features, including anomalies in the data. Symbolic data analysis (SDA) provides a framework for the representation and analysis of railway track data that comprehends inherent variability. There are two different types of SDA: temporal aggregation and contemporary aggregation. There are a few advances in methods, which include multiple imputation, maximum likelihood methods, and Bayesian simulation methods for big data.","","9781119229056","10.1002/9781119229070.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821487.pdf&bkn=9820800&pdfType=chapter","","Data analysis;Rail transportation;Uncertainty;Structured Query Language;Stochastic processes;Statistical analysis;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

DP is the current application that is discussed in the realm of sensitivity of railway track data and in addressing how the sensitivity attributes in track data can cause unwarranted danger to the safety and smooth operation of the train, for example, how an intruder to railway track monitoring data could be capable of identifying some of the critical and vulnerable parts of the track.

In recent years, agent-based crowdsourcing approaches focusing on recommendations or incentives have emerged to dynamically match workers with diverse characteristics to tasks to achieve high collective productivity. However, existing approaches are mostly designed based on expert knowledge grounded in well-established theoretical frameworks. They often fail to leverage on user-generated data to capture the complex interaction of crowdsourcing participants' behaviours. This paper aims to address this challenge. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a policy network plus reputation network (PNRN) approach which combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to imitate human task allocation strategies which beat artificial intelligence strategies in this large-scale empirical study. The proposed approach incorporates a policy network for the selection of task allocation strategies and a reputation network for calculating the trends of worker reputation fluctuations. Then, by iteratively applying the policy network and reputation network, a multi-round allocation strategy is proposed. Findings - PNRN has been trained and evaluated using a large-scale real human task allocation strategy data set derived from the Agile Manager game with close to 500,000 decision records from 1,144 players in over 9,000 game sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity and efficiency of computational complex crowdsourcing task allocation strategy learned from human participants.

Since people are more dependent on their close social relationships as they age, understanding the quality of relationships between aged parents and their adult children is a critical topic. Previous research shows that this relationship is complicated with both kinship and ambivalence. However, there is little research on the causes of this complexity. This paper proposes a role model to explain this complexity by studying the leadership transition within a family as the child grows. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, we proposed a novel perception to understand this transition process and explain related problems based on the analysis of the leader-follower relationship between the parents and their children. Findings – When a child is born, his/her parents become the leader of this family because of their abilities, responsibilities and the requirements of the infant. This leader-follower role structure will last a long time in this family. Decades later, when the parents become old and the child grows up, the inter-generational contracts within the family and the requirement of each members change. This transition weakens the foundation of the traditional leader-follower role structure within the family. If either the parent or the child does not want to accept their new roles, both of them will suffer and struggle in this relationship. This role conflict will cause ambivalence in the relationship between aged parents and their adult children. Originality/value – Based on the quantitative study model provided in this paper, we can moderate the relationships between aged parents and their adult children. This effort is meaningful in enhancing the quality of life and emotional wellbeing for senior citizens.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-08-2017-0012","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826551","Role;ambivalence;inter-generation relationship;parent-child","Leadership;Analytical models;Aging;Complexity theory;Older adults;Contracts","","","","","","22","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Design/methodology/approach – This paper first proposed a model to depict the effect of four categories of game elements on three types of motivation based upon several motivation theories, which may, in turn, influence user participation. Then, $5\times 2$ between-subject Web experiments were designed for collecting data and validating this model. Findings – Game elements which provide participants with rewards and recognitions or remind participants of the completion progress of their tasks may positively influence the extrinsic motivation, whereas game elements which can help create a fantasy scene may strengthen intrinsic motivation. Besides, recognition-kind and progress-kind game elements may trigger the internalization of extrinsic motivation. In addition, when a task is of high complexity, the effects from game elements on extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation will be less prominent, whereas the internalization of extrinsic motivation may benefit from the increase of task complexity. Originality/value – This study may uncover the motivation mechanism of several different kinds of game elements, which may help to find which game elements are more effective in enhancing engagement and participation in crowdsourcing projects. Besides, as task complexity is used as a moderator, one may be able to identify whether task complexity is able to influence the effects from game elements on motivations. Last, but not the least, this study will indicate the interrelationship between game elements, individual motivation and user participation, which can be adapted by other scholars.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-12-2016-0001","National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:14AZD045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9819807","Gamification;Crowd behaviour analysis;Crowd-sourced design and engineering;Task-oriented crowdsourcing;Paper type Conceptual paper","Crowdsourcing;Games;Data models;Complexity theory;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis;Context modeling","","","","3","","41","","7 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Design/methodology/approach – This study models the MCIN by node model definition, multi-agent architecture design and addressing method presentation. Findings – The prototype of novel E-commerce platform based on the MCIN shows the effectiveness and soundness of the MCIN modeling. By comparing to current internet, the authors also find that the MCIN has the advantages of socialization, information integration, collective intelligence, traceability, high robustness, unification of producing and consuming, high scalability and decentralization. Research limitations/implications – Leveraging the dimensions of structure, character, knowledge and experience, a modeling approach of the basic information can fit all kinds of the MCIN nodes. With the double chain structure for both basic and supply–demand information, the MCIN nodes can be modeled comprehensively. The anima-desire-intention-based multi-agent architecture makes the federated agents of the MCIN nodes self-organized and intelligent. The MCIN nodes can be efficiently addressed by the supply-demand-oriented method. However, the implementation of the MCIN is still in process. Practical implications – This paper lays the theoretical foundation for the future networked system of supply–demand relationship and the novel E-commerce platform. Originality/value – The authors believe that the MCIN, first proposed in this paper, is a transformational innovation which facilitates the infrastructure of the future networked system of supply–demand relationship.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-01-2017-0001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9819806","E-commerce;Cyber physics social system;Multi-agent;Supply-demand relationship","Technological innovation;Intelligent networks;Biological system modeling;Scalability;Prototypes;Collective intelligence;Robustness","","","","9","","6","","7 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

"Application of keyword extraction on MOOC resources","Z. Jiang; C. Miao; X.

With more and more courses being produced by instructors and being participated by learners all over the world, unprecedented massive educational resources are aggregated. The educational resources include videos, subtitles, lecture notes, quizzes, etc., on the teaching side, and forum contents, Wiki, log of learning behavior, log of homework, etc., on the learning side. However, the data are both unstructured and diverse. To facilitate knowledge management and mining on MOOCs, extracting keywords from the resources is important. This paper aims to adapt the state-of-the-art techniques to MOOC settings and evaluate the effectiveness on real data. In terms of practice, this paper also tries to answer the questions for the first time that to what extend can the MOOC resources support keyword extraction models, and how many human efforts are required to make the models work well. Design/methodology/approach – Based on which side generates the data, i.e instructors or learners, the data are classified to teaching resources and learning resources, respectively. The approach used on teaching resources is based on machine learning models with labels, while the approach used on learning resources is based on graph model without labels. Findings – From the teaching resources, the methods used by the authors can accurately extract keywords with only 10 per cent labeled data. The authors find a characteristic of the data that the resources of various forms, e.g. subtitles and PPTs, should be separately considered because they have the different model ability. From the learning resources, the keywords extracted from MOOC forums are not as domain-specific as those extracted from teaching resources, but they can reflect the topics which are lively discussed in forums. Then instructors can get feedback from the indication. The authors implement two applications with the extracted keywords: generating concept map and generating learning path. The visual demos show they have the potential to improve learning efficiency when they are integrated into a real MOOC platform. Research limitations/implications – Conducting keyword extraction on MOOC resources is quite difficult because teaching resources are hard to be obtained due to copyrights. Also, getting labeled data is tough because usually expertise of the corresponding domain is required. Practical implications – The experiment results support that MOOC resources are good enough for building models of keyword extraction, and an acceptable balance between human efforts and model accuracy can be achieved. Originality/value – This paper presents a pioneer study on keyword extraction on MOOC resources and obtains some new findings.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-12-2016-0003","National Research Foundation; China NSFC(grant numbers:61532001,61472013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808324","Concept map;Graph model;Keyword extraction;Learning path;Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)","Computer aided instruction;Electronic publishing;Electronic learning;Education;Buildings;Data models;Internet","","","","","","38","","27 Jun 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

We apply for the first time an object detection model previously used on natural images to identify cells and recognize their stages in brightfield microscopy images of malaria-infected blood. Many micro-organisms like malaria parasites are still studied by expert manual inspection and hand counting. This type of object detection task is challenging due to factors like variations in cell shape, density, and color, and uncertainty of some cell classes. In addition, annotated data useful for training is scarce, and the class distribution is inherently highly imbalanced due to the dominance of uninfected red blood cells. We use Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), one of the top performing object detection models in recent years, pre-trained on ImageNet but fine tuned with our data, and compare it to a baseline, which is based on a traditional approach consisting of cell segmentation, extraction of several single-cell features, and classification using random forests. To conduct our initial study, we collect and label a dataset of 1300 fields of view consisting of around 100,000 individual cells. We demonstrate that Faster R-CNN outperforms our baseline and put the results in context of human performance.","2160-7516","978-1-5386-0733-6","10.1109/CVPRW.2017.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8014846","","Training;Diseases;Object detection;Machine learning;Image segmentation;Computer architecture;Blood","biology computing;biomedical optical imaging;blood;cellular biophysics;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;object detection","Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network;Faster R-CNN;performing object detection models;cell segmentation;single-cell features;100 cells;000 individual cells;deep learning based models;art models;biological image data;object detection model;natural images;brightfield microscopy images;malaria-infected blood;malaria parasites;expert manual inspection;hand counting;object detection task;cell shape;cell classes;annotated data;class distribution;uninfected red blood cells","","59","","","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the primary purpose of this book is to provide strategies to reduce energy use by identifying equipment or items that can become energy hogs while still performing their function and prevent that from occurring. The primary reasons organizations need ECM is due to poor maintenance of energy-using systems and energy losses from motors not turning off when they should. The book includes ECM for electrical, mechanical, building transportation, HVAC, fire-fighting, water supply, drainage and storm water management systems.

CT is a must for today’s and tomorrow’s talent. The added-value of this early exposure to CT is that it will help juniors to shape a solid basis of algorithmic and data structures, which form the basic nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer programming. The added value of developing professionals has its clear impact on the economy perspective, in light of the forecasted demand for today and tomorrow. (World economic forum, 2017) Computer programming is an outstanding way to develop computational thinking skills. It has been taken programming as a useful way for juniors to learn problem solving and computational thinking with an affirmative and quantifiable effect on juniors’ achievement, not only in areas such as math and science, but also in language skills, creativity, interpersonal skills and social emotional interaction.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497195","","Programming profession;Buildings;Information and communication technology;Shape;Qualifications;Problem-solving;Government","computer science education;programming","computational thinking skills;computer programming;language skills;interpersonal skills;information society;data structures;economy perspective;problem solving;junior achievement;social emotional interaction;creativity","","","","","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Frequency-used exemplar-based methods mainly consist of neighbor selection and reconstruction weight representation two parts. However, the training sketches usually are not taken into account during both of the aforementioned two processes. Thus, the obtained reconstruction weight may not fit for the sketch synthesis due to the difference between the selected training photo and sketch patch pairs. In this paper, we propose a joint training model to improve the sketch synthesis performance by concatenating the high-pass information of the training sketch patches with photo patches together when calculating the reconstruction weight. Extensive experiments on public dataset show that the proposed model can obtain outperform target sketches both from subjective and objective comparison.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497161","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497161","sketch synthesis;joint training model;Laplacian of Gaussian filter;random sampling","Training;Law enforcement;Face recognition;Computational modeling;Entertainment industry;Filtering theory;Image reconstruction","image reconstruction","sketch synthesis performance;training sketch patches;reconstruction weight;face sketch synthesis;joint training model;neighbor selection;selected training photo;sketch patch pairs;frequency-used exemplar-based methods","","","","10","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Embedding additional data inside the medical images should not perceptually affect the image quality. The ability of not only localizing tampers, but also recovering the real data of region of interest (ROI), is highly significant for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel ROI reconstruction algorithm based on the data hiding technique. The proposed algorithm can efficiently detect and recover distortions in an irregular region of interest (IROI) in the medical image with its vertices. IROI pixels are embedded in the image itself while preserving the image quality. At the receiver side, the possibly corrupted pixels of the IROI region are detected and recovered. The irregularity of the ROI saves embedding unimportant pixels compared to the other developed algorithms that use the rectangular ROI. This increases the payload capacity. The experimental results show that, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the marked image exceeds 50db, that is 3% increase on the average compared to other methods. Moreover, the shape of the ROI is not limited to rectangular shapes which is more comfortable to physicians.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497148","image reconstruction;data hiding;LSB watermarking embedding;irregular region of interest","Image quality;PSNR;Shape;Watermarking;Receivers;Reconstruction algorithms;Robustness","data encapsulation;image reconstruction;image resolution;medical image processing","medical image;image quality;novel ROI reconstruction algorithm;data hiding technique;irregular region;IROI pixels;irregular ROI-based tamper detection and recovery;digital hospitals era","","","","18","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emergence of distributed and parallel systems became an active solution to the problem of large scale data mining. Parallel computing divides the large task into smaller subtasks that are executed over several nodes. Based on the concept of distributed and parallel systems, the processing of all tasks is performed concurrently and transparently. Handling large scale data mining can be performed using the MapReduce algorithm which splits a large dataset into smaller subsets. The processing is then carried out in a completely parallel mechanism which is the role of the map procedure. Another solution is the use of distributed processing and applying the concept of parallelism. This involves the division of a large dataset manually into subsets, and a number of machine learning algorithms are then applied on each. The outputs are combined in order to obtain the final result. It is possible to implement the mining process of large scale data over a central computing node, but it would be very costly in terms of time and hardware resources. The goal of this paper is to improve the performance of data mining algorithms over a large scale dataset and show a comparison between the results of distributed and parallel, with the centralized manner. One large scale dataset is used for data classification problem and three different algorithms, Random Forest (RF) in the centralized classification, Decision Tree (DT), and Random Tree (RT) in the distributed/parallel classification. The results show improvement in the performance using distributed classification in terms of execution time.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497210","Distributed System;Data Mining;Machine Learning;Parallel computing.","Radio frequency;Distributed processing;Machine learning algorithms;Vegetation;Parallel processing;Hardware;Classification algorithms","data mining;decision trees;parallel processing;pattern classification;random forests","distributed data mining;distributed systems;parallel systems;parallel computing;MapReduce algorithm;distributed processing;machine learning;data classification;distributed classification;random forest;decision tree;random tree;parallel classification","","","","23","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a classification approach for breast cancer subtypes based on integrated clinical and dimensionally reduced gene expression dataset. Obtained experimental results showed that the proposed approach outperformed commonly used classification approaches that solely use either gene expression or clinical dataset.

"Annotated Outdoor Image Compression Based on Sky Replacement","K. F. Hussain; H. A.

It has high priority in seam removing for content aware image resizing due to the low gradient values of sky regions. The result of enlarging image using the content aware image resizing produces obvious non-natural pixels. This paper presents a technique for Annotated Outdoor Image Compression (AOIC) depending on sky replacing. The outdoor images are compressed by replacing the sky region with the nearest sky in a predefined database of sky images to reduce image size. Our work is composed of two stages: encoding stage and decoding stage. In the encoding stage, The sky annotation polygon is used to distinguish sky and non-sky regions. The sky features are extracted from the sky region (e.g., sky type, mean HSV, cloud type, and sun existence/relative position). These features are used to find the index (SI) of nearest sky feature from a predefined database of sky features. Then, the output image is generated that contains the SI, the original height of the image, the vertices of the sky polygon, and the compressed non-sky image. On the decoding stage, the SI is used to load the corresponding sky from a predefined sky image database and compose it with the non-sky region. Our method is tested using the standard outdoor images of LabelMe database which contain sky. Our method replaces the sky region instead of shrinking the sky region as in content aware image resizing. The AOIC can increase the efficiency of storage for annotated image databases. For example, the outdoor images of LabelMe database which contain sky are 2462 images; the size of these images is 121.5MB. The size of these images after compressing them using the AOIC is 34.1MB. In the security industry, the AOIC can be used to reduce the storage of image database that keeps images containing sky captured from external security cameras. Also, it increases the efficiency of sending these images through a network.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497193","Image compression;annotated images;sky features.","Image coding;Image databases;Multimedia Web sites;Feature extraction;Decoding;Image storage;Security","data compression;feature extraction;image annotation;image coding;image colour analysis;image enhancement;image retrieval","Annotated Outdoor Image Compression;sky replacement;sky annotation polygon;sky features;sky image database;AOIC","","","","18","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach consists of four phases namely; a preprocessing phase which uses fitting algorithms, the second phase uses map reduce algorithm, the third one based on two traditional techniques which are KNN and FKNN and the last phase is reduced phase which uses ANN to produce the total accuracy rate. The experimental result of this approach shows that the accuracy rate is 71% compared with the traditional techniques. The traditional algorithms is applied on big data.

Moreover, in conventional concolic testing, branch coverage is not high and there is a need for improving performance in measuring the branch coverage. Therefore, this paper is intended to improve performance and reduce the complexity in measuring the branch coverage for white-box testing. An effective branch coverage measuring plan is proposed in which the input program will be divided into all possible positive and negative branches and only executable branches are sliced. And then coverage is measured by using new proposed metric. To reduce complexity, the original input program is transformed into slice program by using Tree Slicing. Then, to improve performance, branch coverage is produced by using bidirectional symbolic analysis that combines symbolic reachability and symbolic execution and new coverage metric. Path-Sensitively Sliced CFG (PSS-CFG), “Tree Slicing” is used. It is a technique to slice and merge different sub-trees under certain conditions to reduce time complexity. This paper will provide more effective branch coverage by using the sliced program, removing the infeasible branches and new coverage metric.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497146","Bidirectional symbolic analysis;Concolic testing;Path-Sensitively Sliced CFG","Measurement;Software testing;Computer languages;Merging;Estimation;Tools;Software","computational complexity;program diagnostics;program slicing;program testing;reachability analysis","white-box testing;conventional concolic testing;slice program;coverage metric;sliced program;software testing;tree slicing;branch coverage measuring plan;path-sensitively sliced CFG","","","","13","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this fact, this paper establishes an effective people counting framework that automatically estimates the accurate number of people. Unlike the other, this paper proposes extended Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by contributing the region localization and segmentation. Firstly, we make the foreground segmentation in the noisy scene by foreground detection and then localize these detected areas. Finally, each localized region put into the CNN framework to handle the correlated size, occlusion and density level. We evaluate the experiments on challenging crowd counting dataset that gets the significant performance than state-of-art results.

Basically, there are three steps of character recognition such as character segmentation, feature extraction and classification. This paper mainly focus on the Myanmar character segmentation. Character segmentation is a vital area of research for optical character recognition. In this paper, the incoming text based images are segmented into lines, words and characters. Horizontal cropping is used for line segmentation and vertical cropping is used for vertically non-touching word and character segmentation. In a Myanmar compound word, there are one basic character and one or more extended characters. These basic character and extended characters may be connected or not according to the typing style or font style and Myanmar script nature. Therefore, it is difficult to segment these connected characters into individual characters. To solve this problem, we use block based pixel count and aspect ratio. This system can segment both touching characters and non-touching characters in text line image. Features are extracted from this segmenting characters. These individual characters are classified using eight directions chain code features and block based pixel count. Finally, the recognized text image is converted into editable text. In this paper, 92 characters in Myanmar script (34 consonants, 13 dependent vowels, 12 independent vowels, 1 punctuation mark, 10 digits, 8 medial, 5 compound medial, 3 tone characters and 6 compound words) are trained and different test line images that contain various words and characters are tested.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497194","Aspect ratio;Block based pixel;Character recognition;Myanmar script;Segmentation.","Training;Image segmentation;Image recognition;Text recognition;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Blockchains","feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;natural language processing;optical character recognition","segmentation method;Myanmar character recognition;block based pixel count;text image file;editable text file;searchable text file;Myanmar character segmentation;optical character recognition;line segmentation;Myanmar compound word;extended characters;connected characters;touching characters;nontouching characters;text line image;recognized text image;tone characters;text based images;aspect ratio;horizontal cropping;vertical cropping;Myanmar script nature;feature extraction;character classification;test line images","","","","9","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Strange Glow: The Story of Radiation","T. J. Jorgensen",NA,"Strange Glow: The Story of Radiation","","2017","","","","","The fascinating science and history of radiationMore than ever before, radiation is a part of our modern daily lives. We own radiation-emitting phones, regularly get diagnostic x-rays, such as mammograms, and submit to full-body security scans at airports. We worry and debate about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the safety of nuclear power plants. But how much do we really know about radiation? And what are its actual dangers? An accessible blend of narrative history and science, Strange Glow describes mankind's extraordinary, thorny relationship with radiation, including the hard-won lessons of how radiation helps and harms our health. Timothy Jorgensen explores how our knowledge of and experiences with radiation in the last century can lead us to smarter personal decisions about radiation exposures today.Jorgensen introduces key figures in the story of radiation—from Wilhelm Roentgen, the discoverer of x-rays, and pioneering radioactivity researchers Marie and Pierre Curie, to Thomas Edison and the victims of the recent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Tracing the most important events in the evolution of radiation, Jorgensen explains exactly what radiation is, how it produces certain health consequences, and how we can protect ourselves from harm. He also considers a range of practical scenarios such as the risks of radon in our basements, radiation levels in the fish we eat, questions about cell-phone use, and radiation's link to cancer.

How does Google order search results? Why do Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube use fundamentally different rating and recommendation methods—and why does it matter? Is it really true that everyone on Facebook is connected in six steps or less? And how do cat videos—or anything else—go viral? The Power of Networks answers questions like these for the first time in a way that all of us can understand and use, whether at home, the office, or school. Using simple language, analogies, stories, hundreds of illustrations, and no more math than simple addition and multiplication, Christopher Brinton and Mung Chiang provide a smart but accessible introduction to the handful of big ideas that drive the technical and social networks we use every day—from cellular phone networks and cloud computing to the Internet and social media platforms.The Power of Networks unifies these ideas through six fundamental principles of networking, which explain the difficulties in sharing network resources efficiently, how crowds can be wise or not so wise depending on the nature of their connections, how there are many building-blocks of layers in a network, and more. Understanding these simple ideas unlocks the workings of everything from the connections we make on Facebook to the technology that runs such platforms. Along the way, the authors also talk with and share the special insights of renowned experts such as Google's Eric Schmidt, former Verizon Wireless CEO Dennis Strigl, and ""fathers of the Internet"" Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn.Networks are everywhere.

Although he is most famous for the Fibonacci numbers—which, it so happens, he didn't invent—Fibonacci's greatest contribution was as an expositor of mathematical ideas at a level ordinary people could understand. In 1202, Liber abbaci—the ""Book of Calculation""—introduced modern arithmetic to the Western world. Yet Fibonacci was long forgotten after his death, and it was not until the 1960s that his true achievements were finally recognized.Finding Fibonacci is Devlin's compelling firsthand account of his ten-year quest to tell Fibonacci's story. Devlin, a math expositor himself, kept a diary of the undertaking, which he draws on here to describe the project's highs and lows, its false starts and disappointments, the tragedies and unexpected turns, some hilarious episodes, and the occasional lucky breaks. You will also meet the unique individuals Devlin encountered along the way, people who, each for their own reasons, became fascinated by Fibonacci, from the Yale professor who traced modern finance back to Fibonacci to the Italian historian who made the crucial archival discovery that brought together all the threads of Fibonacci's astonishing story.Fibonacci helped to revive the West as the cradle of science, technology, and commerce, yet he vanished from the pages of history.

For example, it does not include a quantum theory of gravity, nor does it explain the existence of dark matter. Once complete, however, the standard model could provide a unified description of the very building blocks of the universe. Researchers have been chasing this dream for decades, and many wonder whether such a dream can ever be made a reality.Can the Laws of Physics Be Unified? is a short introduction to this exciting frontier of physics. The book is accessibly written for students and researchers across the sciences, and for scientifically minded general readers. Paul Langacker begins with an overview of the key breakthroughs that have shaped the standard model, and then describes the fundamental particles, their interactions, and their role in cosmology. He goes on to explain field theory, internal symmetries, Yang-Mills theories, strong and electroweak interactions, the Higgs boson discovery, and neutrino physics. Langacker then looks at the questions that are still unanswered: What is the nature of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy that make up roughly 95 percent of the universe? Why is there more matter than antimatter? How can we reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity?Can the Laws of Physics Be Unified? describes the promising theoretical ideas and new experiments that could provide answers and weighs our prospects for establishing a truly unified theory of the smallest constituents of nature and their interactions.","","9781400885503","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452332.pdf&bkn=9452331&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

In 1912, a book dealer named Wilfrid Voynich came into possession of an illuminated cipher manuscript once belonging to Emperor Rudolf II, who was obsessed with alchemy and the occult. Wartime codebreakers tried—and failed—to unlock the book's secrets, and it remains an enigma to this day. In this lively and entertaining book, Craig Bauer examines these and other vexing ciphers yet to be cracked. Some may reveal the identity of a spy or serial killer, provide the location of buried treasure, or expose a secret society—while others may be elaborate hoaxes.Unsolved! begins by explaining the basics of cryptology, and then explores the history behind an array of unsolved ciphers. It looks at ancient ciphers, ciphers created by artists and composers, ciphers left by killers and victims, Cold War ciphers, and many others. Some are infamous, like the ciphers in the Zodiac letters, while others were created purely as intellectual challenges by figures such as Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard P. Feynman. Bauer lays out the evidence surrounding each cipher, describes the efforts of geniuses and eccentrics—in some cases both—to decipher it, and invites readers to try their hand at puzzles that have stymied so many others.Unsolved! takes readers from the ancient world to the digital age, providing an amazing tour of many of history's greatest unsolved ciphers.","","9781400884797","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453439.pdf&bkn=9453438&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

The Great Formal Machinery Works draws on original sources and rare archival materials to trace the history of the theories of deduction and computation that laid the logical foundations for the digital revolution.Jan von Plato examines the contributions of figures such as Aristotle; the nineteenth-century German polymath Hermann Grassmann; George Boole, whose Boolean logic would prove essential to programming languages and computing; Ernst Schröder, best known for his work on algebraic logic; and Giuseppe Peano, cofounder of mathematical logic. Von Plato shows how the idea of a formal proof in mathematics emerged gradually in the second half of the nineteenth century, hand in hand with the notion of a formal process of computation. A turning point was reached by 1930, when Kurt Gödel conceived his celebrated incompleteness theorems. They were an enormous boost to the study of formal languages and computability, which were brought to perfection by the end of the 1930s with precise theories of formal languages and formal deduction and parallel theories of algorithmic computability. Von Plato describes how the first theoretical ideas of a computer soon emerged in the work of Alan Turing in 1936 and John von Neumann some years later.Shedding new light on this crucial chapter in the history of science, The Great Formal Machinery Works is essential reading for students and researchers in logic, mathematics, and computer science.","","9781400885039","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452382.pdf&bkn=9452381&pdfType=book","information age;algebraic logic;programming language;deduction;computation;digital revolution;mathematical logic;incompleteness theorems;algorithmic computability;non-Euclidan geometries;axioms;triangles;Earth;angles;geometry;hypothetic reasoning;mathematics;mathematical roots;parallel postulate;Eugenio Beltrami;arithmetic;Peano;Hermann Grassmann;George Boole;calculus;deductive reasoning;algebraic equations;one-place predicates;Gottlob Frege;contemporary logic;Begriffsschrift;notation;pure thinking;Bertrand Russell;Guiseppe Peano;logic;Principia Mathematica;logical truths;theorems;basic notions;finitism;Leopold Kronecker;Kurt Hensel;Thoralf Skolem;Ernst Schröder;lattice theory;Heyting algebras;Göttingen;David Hilbert;connectives;negation;Paul Bernays;Arend Heyting;Kurt Gödel;Vienna Circle;Moritz Schlick;logical empiricism;philosophy;Rudolf Carnap;Karl Menger;Gerard Gentzen;mathematical proofs;logical structure;inference;assumptions;proof;intuistic arithmetic;Gödel;Gentzen;classical arithmetic;Hilbert;quantificational inferences;indirect proofs;finitary reasoning","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

One of the world's leading astronomers, Robert Kirshner, takes readers inside a lively research team on the quest that led them to an extraordinary cosmological discovery: the expansion of the universe is accelerating under the influence of a dark energy that makes space itself expand. In addition to sharing the story of this exciting discovery, Kirshner also brings the science up-to-date in a new epilogue. He explains how the idea of an accelerating universe--once a daring interpretation of sketchy data--is now the standard assumption in cosmology today. This measurement of dark energy--a quality of space itself that causes cosmic acceleration--points to a gaping hole in our understanding of fundamental physics. In 1917, Einstein proposed the ""cosmological constant"" to explain a static universe. When observations proved that the universe was expanding, he cast this early form of dark energy aside. But recent observations described first-hand in this book show that the cosmological constant--or something just like it--dominates the universe's mass and energy budget and determines its fate and shape. Warned by Einstein's blunder, and contradicted by the initial results of a competing research team, Kirshner and his colleagues were reluctant to accept their own result. But, convinced by evidence built on their hard-earned understanding of exploding stars, they announced their conclusion that the universe is accelerating in February 1998. Other lines of inquiry and parallel supernova research now support a new synthesis of a cosmos dominated by dark energy but also containing several forms of dark matter. We live in an extravagant universe with a surprising number of essential ingredients: the real universe we measure is not the simplest one we could imagine.","","9781400883806","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453284.pdf&bkn=9453283&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"The Calculus of Happiness: How a Mathematical Approach to Life Adds Up to Health, Wealth, and Love","O. Fernandez",NA,"The Calculus of Happiness: How a Mathematical Approach to Life Adds Up to Health, Wealth, and Love","","2017","","","","","How math holds the keys to improving one's health, wealth, and love lifeWhat's the best diet for overall health and weight management? How can we change our finances to retire earlier? How can we maximize our chances of finding our soul mate?In The Calculus of Happiness, Oscar Fernandez shows us that math yields powerful insights into health, wealth, and love. Using only high-school-level math (precalculus with a dash of calculus), Fernandez guides us through several of the surprising results, including an easy rule of thumb for choosing foods that lower our risk for developing diabetes (and that help us lose weight too), simple ""all-weather"" investment portfolios with great returns, and math-backed strategies for achieving financial independence and searching for our soul mate. Moreover, the important formulas are linked to a dozen free online interactive calculators on the book’s website, allowing one to personalize the equations.Fernandez uses everyday experiences—such as visiting a coffee shop—to provide context for his mathematical insights, making the math discussed more accessible, real-world, and relevant to our daily lives. Every chapter ends with a summary of essential lessons and takeaways, and for advanced math fans, Fernandez includes the mathematical derivations in the appendices.A nutrition, personal finance, and relationship how-to guide all in one, The Calculus of Happiness invites you to discover how empowering mathematics can be.","","9781400884810","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452472.pdf&bkn=9452471&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Making and Breaking Mathematical Sense: Histories and Philosophies of Mathematical Practice","R. Wagner",NA,"Making and Breaking Mathematical Sense: Histories and Philosophies of Mathematical Practice","","2017","","","","","In line with the emerging field of philosophy of mathematical practice, this book pushes the philosophy of mathematics away from questions about the reality and truth of mathematical entities and statements and toward a focus on what mathematicians actually do—and how that evolves and changes over time. How do new mathematical entities come to be? What internal, natural, cognitive, and social constraints shape mathematical cultures? How do mathematical signs form and reform their meanings? How can we model the cognitive processes at play in mathematical evolution? And how does mathematics tie together ideas, reality, and applications?Roi Wagner uniquely combines philosophical, historical, and cognitive studies to paint a fully rounded image of mathematics not as an absolute ideal but as a human endeavor that takes shape in specific social and institutional contexts. The book builds on ancient, medieval, and modern case studies to confront philosophical reconstructions and cutting-edge cognitive theories. It focuses on the contingent semiotic and interpretive dimensions of mathematical practice, rather than on mathematics' claim to universal or fundamental truths, in order to explore not only what mathematics is, but also what it could be. Along the way, Wagner challenges conventional views that mathematical signs represent fixed, ideal entities; that mathematical cognition is a rigid transfer of inferences between formal domains; and that mathematics’ exceptional consensus is due to the subject’s underlying reality.The result is a revisionist account of mathematical philosophy that will interest mathematicians, philosophers, and historians of science alike.","","9781400883783","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452500.pdf&bkn=9452499&pdfType=book","mathematics;mathematical entities;mathematical cultures;mathematical signs;mathematical evolution;mathematical practice;mathematical cognition;philosophy of mathematics;mathematical statements;mathematical interpretation;semiosis;mathematical metaphor;option pricing;Black-Scholes formula;natural order;conceptual freedom;reason;nature;authority;mathematical norms;mathematical standards;algebra;abbaco;Benedetto;economy;arithmetic;negative numbers;constraints;Hilary Putnam;relevance;combinatorics;generating functions;gender role stereotypes;stable marriage problem;mathematical objects;mathematical language;sexuality;Stanislas Dehaene;number sense;Vincent Walsh;Water J.

"Why Stock Markets Crash: Critical Events in Complex Financial Systems","D. Sornette; D. Sornette",NA; NA,"Why Stock Markets Crash: Critical Events in Complex Financial Systems","","2017","","","","","The scientific study of complex systems has transformed a wide range of disciplines in recent years, enabling researchers in both the natural and social sciences to model and predict phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, global warming, demographic patterns, financial crises, and the failure of materials. In this book, Didier Sornette boldly applies his varied experience in these areas to propose a simple, powerful, and general theory of how, why, and when stock markets crash. Most attempts to explain market failures seek to pinpoint triggering mechanisms that occur hours, days, or weeks before the collapse. Sornette proposes a radically different view: the underlying cause can be sought months and even years before the abrupt, catastrophic event in the build-up of cooperative speculation, which often translates into an accelerating rise of the market price, otherwise known as a ""bubble."" Anchoring his sophisticated, step-by-step analysis in leading-edge physical and statistical modeling techniques, he unearths remarkable insights and some predictions--among them, that the ""end of the growth era"" will occur around 2050. Sornette probes major historical precedents, from the decades-long ""tulip mania"" in the Netherlands that wilted suddenly in 1637 to the South Sea Bubble that ended with the first huge market crash in England in 1720, to the Great Crash of October 1929 and Black Monday in 1987, to cite just a few. He concludes that most explanations other than cooperative self-organization fail to account for the subtle bubbles by which the markets lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Any investor or investment professional who seeks a genuine understanding of looming financial disasters should read this book. Physicists, geologists, biologists, economists, and others will welcome Why Stock Markets Crash as a highly original ""scientific tale,"" as Sornette aptly puts it, of the exciting and sometimes fearsome--but no longer quite so unfathomable--world of stock markets.","","9781400885091","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452688.pdf&bkn=9452687&pdfType=book","market failure;cooperative speculation;stock market prices;complex systems;stock market crash;stock market;bubble;self-organization;Black Monday;financial crashes;tulip mania;South Sea bubble;extreme events;computational methods;prediction;returns;arbitrage opportunities;efficient market;Louis Bachelier;random walk;free lunch;risk;drawdown;stock market indices;Dow Jones Industrial Average;Nasdaq index;outlier;positive feedback;herding;derivatives;insurance portfolio;hedging;imitation;anti-imitation;cooperative behavior;rational agent;speculative bubble;crash hazard;risk-driven model;hazard rate;price-driven model;fractals;self-similarity;log-periodicity;social network;discrete scale invariance;renormalization group;finite-time singularity;Hong Kong;currency crash;tronics boom;Nasdaq;antibubble;Nikkei;gold;emergent markets;Latin America;Asia;Russia;power law;forward prediction;world economy;population dynamics;collapse;sustainability;superhumans;natural scientists;social scientists","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Hölder Continuous Euler Flows in Three Dimensions with Compact Support in Time: (AMS-196)","P. Isett",NA,"Hölder Continuous Euler Flows in Three Dimensions with Compact Support in Time: (AMS-196)","","2017","","","","","Motivated by the theory of turbulence in fluids, the physicist and chemist Lars Onsager conjectured in 1949 that weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations might fail to conserve energy if their spatial regularity was below 1/3-Hölder. In this book, Philip Isett uses the method of convex integration to achieve the best-known results regarding nonuniqueness of solutions and Onsager's conjecture. Focusing on the intuition behind the method, the ideas introduced now play a pivotal role in the ongoing study of weak solutions to fluid dynamics equations.The construction itself—an intricate algorithm with hidden symmetries—mixes together transport equations, algebra, the method of nonstationary phase, underdetermined partial differential equations (PDEs), and specially designed high-frequency waves built using nonlinear phase functions. The powerful ""Main Lemma""—used here to construct nonzero solutions with compact support in time and to prove nonuniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem—has been extended to a broad range of applications that are surveyed in the appendix. Appropriate for students and researchers studying nonlinear PDEs, this book aims to be as robust as possible and pinpoints the main difficulties that presently stand in the way of a full solution to Onsager's conjecture.","","9781400885428","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452464.pdf&bkn=9452463&pdfType=book","weak solution;Lars Onsager;Euler equations;convex integration;fluid dynamics;transport equations;algebra;nonzero solution;Onsager's conjecture;Main Lemma;Euler flow;Euler-Reynolds equations;weak limit;frequencies;h-principle;error;continuous solution;frequency energy levels;optimal regularity;Euler-Reynolds system;correction;divergence free vector field;Transport term;HighЌow Interaction term;HighЈigh Interference term;Stress term;Mollification term;Einstein summation convention;abstract index notation;upper indices;lower indices;contravariant tensor;covariant tensor;multi-index;theorem;non-negative function;finite time interval;divergence equation;smooth function;smooth vector field;tensor;conservation of momentum;Newton's law;Noether's theorem;phase function;coarse scale velocity;time cutoff function;Beltrami flows;Stress equation;mollification;velocity;stress;energy increment;Hlder regularity;scaling symmetry;dimensional analysis;energy regularity;energy function;Main Theorem;Galilean transformation;momentum;pressure;smooth stress tensor;energy;Hlder norm;spatial derivative;convergence;mollifier;moment vanishing condition;integral;velocity field;parametrix;coarse scale flow;commutator estimate;Transport equation;commutator;commutator term;lifespan parameter;phase gradient;relative velocity;relative acceleration;Reynolds stres;Galilean invariance;error term;transport estimate;parameters;HighЈigh term;Reynolds stress;regularity;coefficient;transport derivative;vector amplitude;transport;first material derivative;second material derivative;correction term;velocity correction;oscillatory factor;phase direction","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Have you ever wondered about the connections between games and mathematics? If the answer to either question is ""yes,"" then The Joy of SET is the book for you! The Joy of SET takes readers on a fascinating journey into this seemingly simple card game and reveals its surprisingly deep and diverse mathematical dimensions. Absolutely no mathematical background is necessary to enjoy this book—all you need is a sense of curiosity and adventure!Originally invented in 1974 by Marsha Falco and officially released in 1991, SET has gained a widespread, loyal following. SET's eighty-one cards consist of one, two, or three symbols of different shapes (diamond, oval, squiggle), shadings (solid, striped, open), and colors (green, purple, red). In order to win, players must identify “sets” of three cards for which each characteristic is the same—or different—on all the cards. SET’s strategic and unique design opens connections to a plethora of mathematical disciplines, including geometry, modular arithmetic, combinatorics, probability, linear algebra, and computer simulations. The Joy of SET looks at these areas as well as avenues for further mathematical exploration. As the authors show, the relationship between SET and mathematics runs in both directions—playing this game has generated new mathematics, and the math has led to new questions about the game itself.The first book devoted to the mathematics of one of today’s most popular card games, The Joy of SET will entertain and enlighten the game enthusiast in all of us.","","9781400884483","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452634.pdf&bkn=9452633&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Asymptotic Differential Algebra and Model Theory of Transseries: (AMS-195)","M. Aschenbrenner; L. van den Dries; J. van der Hoeven",NA; NA; NA,"Asymptotic Differential Algebra and Model Theory of Transseries: (AMS-195)","","2017","","","","","Asymptotic differential algebra seeks to understand the solutions of differential equations and their asymptotics from an algebraic point of view. The differential field of transseries plays a central role in the subject. Besides powers of the variable, these series may contain exponential and logarithmic terms. Over the last thirty years, transseries emerged variously as super-exact asymptotic expansions of return maps of analytic vector fields, in connection with Tarski's problem on the field of reals with exponentiation, and in mathematical physics. Their formal nature also makes them suitable for machine computations in computer algebra systems.This self-contained book validates the intuition that the differential field of transseries is a universal domain for asymptotic differential algebra. It does so by establishing in the realm of transseries a complete elimination theory for systems of algebraic differential equations with asymptotic side conditions. Beginning with background chapters on valuations and differential algebra, the book goes on to develop the basic theory of valued differential fields, including a notion of differential-henselianity. Next, H-fields are singled out among ordered valued differential fields to provide an algebraic setting for the common properties of Hardy fields and the differential field of transseries. The study of their extensions culminates in an analogue of the algebraic closure of a field: the Newton-Liouville closure of an H-field. This paves the way to a quantifier elimination with interesting consequences.","","9781400885411","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452658.pdf&bkn=9452657&pdfType=book","asymptotic differential algebra;differential field;asymptotics;transseries;differential-hensel;H-field;Newton-Liouville closure;valuation;valued differential field;mathematics;ordered differential field;grid-based transseries;closure properties;asymptotic relation;commutative algebra;Johnson's Theorem;algebraic differential equation;regular local ring;Kähler differentials;commutative ring;Zariski topology;noetherian ring;integrally closed domain;Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem;valued abelian group;ordered set;ordered abelian group;valued field;pseudocauchy sequence;Hahn Embedding Theorem;valued vector space;Hahn space;extension;pseudoconvergence;henselian valued field;Newton diagram;Newton tree;differential polynomial;decomposition;continuity;derivation;valuation topology;gaussian extension;simple differential ring;differentially closed field;linear differential polynomial;homogeneous differential polynomial;linear differential operator;linear differential equation;differential module;compositional conjugation;Riccati transform;differential field extension;residue field;small derivation;value group;asymptotic couple;dominant part;Equalizer Theorem;immediate extension;differential-henselian field;d-henselianity;d-henselian;maximal immediate extension;constant;monotonicity;differential-henselianity;Scanlon's extension;angular component map;equivalence;substructure;quantifier elimination;model companion;asymptotic field;H-asymptotic couple;coarsening;specialization;algebraic extension;closed H-asymptotic couple;integral;differential-valued extension;exponential integral;Liouville closed H-field;Liouville closure;pre-differential-valued field;eventual quantities;special cut;Newton weight;Newton degree;Newton multiplicity;H-asymptotic field;rational asymptotic integration;triangular automorphism;triangular derivation;filtered module","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

"The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas","C. C. Gillispie; T. M. Porter",NA; NA,"The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas","","2017","","","","","Originally published in 1960, The Edge of Objectivity helped to establish the history of science as a full-fledged academic discipline. In the mid-1950s, a young professor at Princeton named Charles Gillispie began teaching Humanities 304, one of the first undergraduate courses offered anywhere in the world on the history of science. From Galileo's analysis of motion to theories of evolution and relativity, Gillispie introduces key concepts, individuals, and themes. The Edge of Objectivity arose out of this course. It must have been a lively class. The Edge of Objectivity is pointed, opinionated, and selective. Even at six hundred pages, the book is, as the title suggests, an essay. Gillispie is unafraid to rate Mendel higher than Darwin, Maxwell above Faraday. Full of wry turns of phrase, the book effectively captures people and places. And throughout the book, Gillispie pushes an argument. He views science as the progressive development of more objective, detached, mathematical ways of viewing the world, and he orchestrates his characters and ideas around this theme. This edition of Charles Coulston Gillispie’s landmark book introduces a new generation of readers to his provocative and enlightening account of the advancement of scientific thought over the course of four centuries. Since the original publication of The Edge of Objectivity, historians of science have focused increasingly on the social context of science rather than its internal dynamics, and they have frequently viewed science more as a threatening instance of power than as an accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, Gillispie’s book remains a sophisticated, fast-moving, idiosyncratic account of the development of scientific ideas over four hundred years, by one of the founding intellects in the history of science.Featuring a new foreword by Theodore Porter, who places the work in its intellectual context and the development of the field, this edition of The Edge of Objectivity is a monumental work by one of the founding intellects of the history of science.","","9781400883585","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453252.pdf&bkn=9453251&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Dijkgraaf",NA; NA,"The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge","","2017","","","","","A short, provocative book about why ""useless"" science often leads to humanity's greatest technological breakthroughsA forty-year tightening of funding for scientific research has meant that resources are increasingly directed toward applied or practical outcomes, with the intent of creating products of immediate value. In such a scenario, it makes sense to focus on the most identifiable and urgent problems, right? Actually, it doesn't. In his classic essay ""The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge,"" Abraham Flexner, the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the man who helped bring Albert Einstein to the United States, describes a great paradox of scientific research. The search for answers to deep questions, motivated solely by curiosity and without concern for applications, often leads not only to the greatest scientific discoveries but also to the most revolutionary technological breakthroughs. In short, no quantum mechanics, no computer chips.This brief book includes Flexner's timeless 1939 essay alongside a new companion essay by Robbert Dijkgraaf, the Institute's current director, in which he shows that Flexner's defense of the value of ""the unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge"" may be even more relevant today than it was in the early twentieth century. Dijkgraaf describes how basic research has led to major transformations in the past century and explains why it is an essential precondition of innovation and the first step in social and cultural change. He makes the case that society can achieve deeper understanding and practical progress today and tomorrow only by truly valuing and substantially funding the curiosity-driven ""pursuit of useless knowledge"" in both the sciences and the humanities.","","9781400884629","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452368.pdf&bkn=9452367&pdfType=book","pure;science;research;applied;case against utilitarianism;applications;research;basic;fundamental;theoretical;technical innovation;hard science;innovation;discovery;history of science;history of technology;advances;technology transfer;TT;transfer of technology;TOT;technological revolution;hard;STS;STEM;soft;blue skies;pure mathematics;pure chemistry;theoretical physics;research and development;R&D","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"
"Noncooperative Game Theory: An Introduction for Engineers and Computer Scientists","J. P. Hespanha",NA,"Noncooperative Game Theory: An Introduction for Engineers and Computer Scientists","","2017","","","","","Noncooperative Game Theory is aimed at students interested in using game theory as a design methodology for solving problems in engineering and computer science. João Hespanha shows that such design challenges can be analyzed through game theoretical perspectives that help to pinpoint each problem's essence: Who are the players? What are their goals? Will the solution to ""the game"" solve the original design problem? Using the fundamentals of game theory, Hespanha explores these issues and more.The use of game theory in technology design is a recent development arising from the intrinsic limitations of classical optimization-based designs. In optimization, one attempts to find values for parameters that minimize suitably defined criteria—such as monetary cost, energy consumption, or heat generated. However, in most engineering applications, there is always some uncertainty as to how the selected parameters will affect the final objective. Through a sequential and easy-to-understand discussion, Hespanha examines how to make sure that the selection leads to acceptable performance, even in the presence of uncertainty—the unforgiving variable that can wreck engineering designs. Hespanha looks at such standard topics as zero-sum, non-zero-sum, and dynamics games and includes a MATLAB guide to coding.Noncooperative Game Theory offers students a fresh way of approaching engineering and computer science applications.An introduction to game theory applications for students of engineering and computer science Materials presented sequentially and in an easy-to-understand fashionTopics explore zero-sum, non-zero-sum, and dynamics gamesMATLAB commands are included","","9781400885442","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9452372.pdf&bkn=9452371&pdfType=book","game theory;design methodology;engineering;computer science;optimization-based design;uncertainty;zero-sum;non-zero-sum;dynamic game;noncooperative game theory;rope-pulling;robust design;circuit design;network routing;Nash equilibrium;action;policy;advertising campaign;war of attrition;multi-stage game;open-loop;zebra in the lake;chicken game;alternate play;zero-sum matrix;security level;MATLAB;simultaneous play;regret;security policy;saddle-point equilibrium;order interchangeability property;computational complexity;pure policy;mixed policy;probability distribution;rock-paper-scissors;mixed action space;mixed saddle-point equilibrium;average security level;convex hull;Minimax Theorem;convex analysis;Separating Hyperplane Theorem;symmetry game;hyperplane;mixed security policy;graphical method;linear program;strictly dominating policy;weakly dominating policy;extensive form game representation;zero-sum two-person;single-stage game;feedback game;recursive computation;stochastic policy;behavioral policy;behavioral saddle-point equilibrium;non-feedback game;bimatrix game;admissible Nash equilibrium;best-response equivalent games;battle of the sexes;mixed Nash equilibrium;completely mixed Nash equilibrium;N-player game;pure N-player game;potential game;action space;identical interests;minimum;bimatrix potential;dummy game;decoupled game;bilateral symmetric game;congestion game;Sudoku puzzle;distributed resource allocation;fictitious play;tree structure;information structure;continuous time differential;differential game;variable termination time;discrete time dynamic;discrete time cost-to-go;discrete time dynamic programming;finite one-player;linear quadratic dynamic;continuous time dynamic;open-loop policy;state-feedback policy;continuous time cost-to-go;continuous time dynamic programming;zero sum dynamic;tic-tac-toe;state feedback information structure","","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Many applications require analog circuits working with sub 1-V supply voltages and with power consumption in the hundreds of nW range while preserving good performances. The present target is to have analog circuits operating at 0.5-V or less. With that supply voltage it is required to design basic building blocks like operational amplifiers, comparators and voltage reference generators. For each of them, the presentation briefly reviews the state of the art and presents some recently published examples of implemented solutions. The analog-to-digital converter is essential for every modern system. Ensuring very low power while providing a medium-high resolution (914 bit) over a signal bandwidth up to about 1 MHz is a typical goal. For these specifications, SAR converters and sigma-delta modulators are typically used. Techniques and recent circuit implementations capable of satisfying diverse requests are presented.

Unfortunately, today's solid-state technologies including silicon and compound semiconductors have much lower performance at mm-wave frequencies compared to traditional RF bands. In order to overcome this limitation, we have introduced systematic methodologies for designing circuits and components, such as signal sources and amplifiers operating close to and beyond the conventional limits of the devices. These circuit blocks can effectively generate and combine signals from multiple devices to achieve performances orders of magnitude better than the state of the art. As an example, we show the implementation of a 482 GHz oscillator with an output power of 160 μW (-7.9 dBm) in 65 nm CMOS, a 300 GHz frequency synthesizer with 7.9% locking range in 90 nm SiGe, and a 260 GHz amplifier with a gain of 9.2 dB and saturated output power of −3.9 dBm in 65 nm CMOS.","","9788793519176","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450119.pdf&bkn=9431977&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

VahidFar",NA; NA,"Selected Topics in RF, Analog and Mixed Signal Circuits and Systems","","2017","","","9","39","Linear time-invariant (LTI) phase noise theories provide important qualitative design insights but are limited in their quantitative predictive power. Part of the difficulty is that device noise undergoes multiple frequency translations to become oscillator phase noise. A quantitative understanding of this process requires abandoning the principle of time invariance assumed in most older theories of phase noise. Fortunately, the noise-to-phase transfer function of oscillators is still linear, despite the existence of the nonlinearities necessary for amplitude stabilization. In addition to providing a quantitative reconciliation between theory and measurement, the time-varying phase-noise model presented in this tutorial identifies the importance of symmetry in suppressing the upconversion of 1 noise into close-in phase noise, and provides an explicit appreciation of cyclostationary effects and AM-PM conversion. These insights allow a reinterpretation of why the Colpitts oscillator exhibits good performance, and suggest new oscillator topologies. Tuned LC and ring oscillator circuit examples are presented to reinforce the theoretical considerations developed. Simulation issues and the accommodation of amplitude noise are considered in appendixes.","","9788793519176","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450108.pdf&bkn=9431977&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The communication revolution with high speed Internet and high-speed wireless connectivity is an explicit example of year-to- year speed increase due to the advancement in new standards and technologies. The new applications and even higher speed are coming soon which are expected to leverage on the broadening frequency-spectrum access from radio frequencies to millimeter-wave frequencies. Thus, more available bandwidth leads to the proportionate increase of Shannon channel capacity. Shorter wavelengths at mm-Waves enables compact realization of multi-antenna beam-forming transceivers with dense frequency reuse.","","9788793519176","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9450175.pdf&bkn=9431977&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","10 Jun 2021","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This is owing to a steady expansion of the range of enabling devices and technologies, as well as the need for seamless solutions for location-based services. Besides localization accuracy, a common requirement for emerging solutions is that they are cost-abstemious, both in terms of the financial and computational cost. Hence, development of localization strategies from already deployed technologies, e.g., from different terrestrial radio frequency sources is of great practical interest. Amongst other, these include localization strategies based on received signal strength (RSS), time of arrival, angle of arrival (AoA) or a combination of them.

"10 Clinical Picture","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","155","184","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and immunological properties of Coxiella burnetii • Diagnosis, clinical forms and manifestations, pathologic changes • Epidemiology of Q fever in animals and humans • Prevention and Control","","9788793519480","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228454.pdf&bkn=9218874&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Duarte",NA; NA,"Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations Statistical Methods and Optimization","","2017","","","133","174","Circuit Design = Science + Art! Designers need a skilled """"gut feeling"""" about circuits and related analytical techniques, plus creativity, to solve all problems and to adhere to the specifications, the written and the unwritten ones. You must anticipate a large number of influences, like temperature effects, supply voltages changes, offset voltages, layout parasitics, and numerous kinds of technology variations to end up with a circuit that works. This is challenging for analog, custom-digital, mixed-signal or RF circuits, and often researching new design methods in relevant journals, conference proceedings and design tools unfortunately gives the impression that just a """"wild bunch"""" of """"advanced techniques"""" exist. On the other hand, state-of-the-art tools nowadays indeed offer a good cockpit to steer the design flow, which include clever statistical methods and optimization techniques. Actually, this almost presents a second breakthrough, like the introduction of circuit simulators 40 years ago! Users can now conveniently analyse all the problems (discover, quantify, verify), and even exploit them, for example for optimization purposes. Most designers are caught up on everyday problems, so we fit that """"wild bunch"""" into a systematic approach for variation-aware design, a designer's field guide and more. That is where this book can help! Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations starts with best-practise manual methods and links them tightly to up-to-date automation algorithms. We provide many tractable examples and explain key techniques you have to know. We then enable you to select and setup suitable methods for each design task - knowing their prerequisites, advantages and, as too often overlooked, their limitations as well. The good thing with computers is that you yourself can often verify amazing things with little effort, and you can use software not only to your direct advantage in solving a specific problem, but also for becoming a better skilled, more experienced engineer. Unfortunately, EDA design environments are not good at all to learn about advanced numerics. So with this book we also provide two apps for learning about statistic and optimization directly with circuit-related examples, and in real-time so without the long simulation times. This helps to develop a healthy statistical gut feeling for circuit design. The book is written for engineers, students in engineering and CAD / methodology experts. Readers should have some background in standard design techniques like entering a design in a schematic capture and simulating it, and also know about major technology aspects.","","9788793379763","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228055.pdf&bkn=9218893&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Since RF circuits have several unique features, and all analysis methods are based on the circuit essential properties, the book begins by describing the properties of RF circuits, characterization of circuits with customary and uncustomary behavior and some theorems of solutions existence and uniqueness for dynamic nonlinear circuits. Thereafter, the main time domain and frequency domain analysis methods for RF circuits are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of each method have been highlighted, and an algorithm for the time step choice in transient analysis based on energy balance errors is also presented. Lastly, the final part contains some nonlinear circuit models of power BAW resonators. The behavioral models for the time domain analysis are simple circuits containing weakly nonlinear elements. The behavioral models for frequency domain analysis are based on the measured values of the frequency dependent S parameters for a set of incident powers. S parameters corresponding to certain intermodulation products of practical interest are also considered. The physical models contain artificial transmission lines with nonlinear circuit elements corresponding to mechanical and electrical nonlinearities.","","9788793379459","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227846.pdf&bkn=9218859&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"Index","",,"Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves","","2017","","","297","300","Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is considered to be an innovative game changing technology. The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is “carried” on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer. Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves focusses on recent technologies and applications of the WPT via radio waves in far field. The book also covers the history, and future, of WPT via radio waves, as well as safety, EMC and coexistence of radio waves for WPT. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Radio Wave Generation • Radio Wave Amplification with Solid States Circuit and Microwave Tubes • Antenna and Beam Forming Technologies • Radio Wave Conversion/Rectification to Electricity • Battery-less Sensor Applications toward Internet of Things (IoT) • Solar Power Satellite Application • Safety, EMC, Coexistence of Radio Waves for the WPT WPT is an old technology based on the basic theory of radio waves, however WPT is also a state-of-the-art technology for the latest applications in IoT, sensor networks, wireless chargers for mobile phones, and solar power satellite.

"Appendix","S. Weber; C. Duarte",NA; NA,"Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations Statistical Methods and Optimization","","2017","","","551","568","Circuit Design = Science + Art! Designers need a skilled """"gut feeling"""" about circuits and related analytical techniques, plus creativity, to solve all problems and to adhere to the specifications, the written and the unwritten ones. You must anticipate a large number of influences, like temperature effects, supply voltages changes, offset voltages, layout parasitics, and numerous kinds of technology variations to end up with a circuit that works. This is challenging for analog, custom-digital, mixed-signal or RF circuits, and often researching new design methods in relevant journals, conference proceedings and design tools unfortunately gives the impression that just a """"wild bunch"""" of """"advanced techniques"""" exist. On the other hand, state-of-the-art tools nowadays indeed offer a good cockpit to steer the design flow, which include clever statistical methods and optimization techniques. Actually, this almost presents a second breakthrough, like the introduction of circuit simulators 40 years ago! Users can now conveniently analyse all the problems (discover, quantify, verify), and even exploit them, for example for optimization purposes. Most designers are caught up on everyday problems, so we fit that """"wild bunch"""" into a systematic approach for variation-aware design, a designer's field guide and more. That is where this book can help! Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations starts with best-practise manual methods and links them tightly to up-to-date automation algorithms. We provide many tractable examples and explain key techniques you have to know. We then enable you to select and setup suitable methods for each design task - knowing their prerequisites, advantages and, as too often overlooked, their limitations as well. The good thing with computers is that you yourself can often verify amazing things with little effort, and you can use software not only to your direct advantage in solving a specific problem, but also for becoming a better skilled, more experienced engineer. Unfortunately, EDA design environments are not good at all to learn about advanced numerics. So with this book we also provide two apps for learning about statistic and optimization directly with circuit-related examples, and in real-time so without the long simulation times. This helps to develop a healthy statistical gut feeling for circuit design. The book is written for engineers, students in engineering and CAD / methodology experts. Readers should have some background in standard design techniques like entering a design in a schematic capture and simulating it, and also know about major technology aspects.","","9788793379763","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227994.pdf&bkn=9218893&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"8 Serology","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","77","140","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and immunological properties of Coxiella burnetii • Diagnosis, clinical forms and manifestations, pathologic changes • Epidemiology of Q fever in animals and humans • Prevention and Control","","9788793519480","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228560.pdf&bkn=9218874&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"3 Potentials and Fields and the Lagrangian","W. Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","17","22","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Electromagnetic Field Equations • Constitutive Relations • Discretization and Numerical Analysis • Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods • Design of Integrated Passive Components","","9788793519831","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228499.pdf&bkn=9218768&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","17","38","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

Bacanin",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"RSS-AoA-based Target Localization and Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","","2017","","","i","xxi","The desire for precise knowledge about the location of a moving object at any time instant has motivated a great deal of scientific research recently. This is owing to a steady expansion of the range of enabling devices and technologies, as well as the need for seamless solutions for location-based services. Besides localization accuracy, a common requirement for emerging solutions is that they are cost-abstemious, both in terms of the financial and computational cost. Hence, development of localization strategies from already deployed technologies, e.g., from different terrestrial radio frequency sources is of great practical interest. Amongst other, these include localization strategies based on received signal strength (RSS), time of arrival, angle of arrival (AoA) or a combination of them. RSS-AoA-based Target Localization and Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks presents recent advances in developing algorithms for target localization and tracking, reflecting the state-of-the-art algorithms and research achievements in target localization and tracking based on hybrid (RSS-AoA) measurements. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Centralized RSS-AoA-based Target Localization • Distributed RSS-AoA-based Target Localization • RSS-AoA-based Target Tracking via Maximum A Posteriori Estimator • RSS-AoA-based Target Tracking via Kalman Filter • RSS-AoA-based via Sensor Navigation This book is of interest for personnel in telecommunications and surveillance industries, military, smart systems, as well as academic staff and postgraduate/research students in telecommunications, signal processing, and non-smooth and convex optimization.","","9788793519879","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228512.pdf&bkn=9218769&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

"7 Antigens and Phase Variability","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","75","76","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism.

"8 Optimization Techniques for Circuit Design","S. Weber; C. Duarte",NA; NA,"Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations Statistical Methods and Optimization","","2017","","","377","434","Circuit Design = Science + Art! Designers need a skilled """"gut feeling"""" about circuits and related analytical techniques, plus creativity, to solve all problems and to adhere to the specifications, the written and the unwritten ones. You must anticipate a large number of influences, like temperature effects, supply voltages changes, offset voltages, layout parasitics, and numerous kinds of technology variations to end up with a circuit that works. This is challenging for analog, custom-digital, mixed-signal or RF circuits, and often researching new design methods in relevant journals, conference proceedings and design tools unfortunately gives the impression that just a """"wild bunch"""" of """"advanced techniques"""" exist. On the other hand, state-of-the-art tools nowadays indeed offer a good cockpit to steer the design flow, which include clever statistical methods and optimization techniques. Actually, this almost presents a second breakthrough, like the introduction of circuit simulators 40 years ago! Users can now conveniently analyse all the problems (discover, quantify, verify), and even exploit them, for example for optimization purposes. Most designers are caught up on everyday problems, so we fit that """"wild bunch"""" into a systematic approach for variation-aware design, a designer's field guide and more. That is where this book can help! Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations starts with best-practise manual methods and links them tightly to up-to-date automation algorithms. We provide many tractable examples and explain key techniques you have to know. We then enable you to select and setup suitable methods for each design task - knowing their prerequisites, advantages and, as too often overlooked, their limitations as well. The good thing with computers is that you yourself can often verify amazing things with little effort, and you can use software not only to your direct advantage in solving a specific problem, but also for becoming a better skilled, more experienced engineer. Unfortunately, EDA design environments are not good at all to learn about advanced numerics. So with this book we also provide two apps for learning about statistic and optimization directly with circuit-related examples, and in real-time so without the long simulation times. This helps to develop a healthy statistical gut feeling for circuit design. The book is written for engineers, students in engineering and CAD / methodology experts. Readers should have some background in standard design techniques like entering a design in a schematic capture and simulating it, and also know about major technology aspects.","","9788793379763","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227987.pdf&bkn=9218893&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"12 The Finite Element Method","W. Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","121","128","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics.

Capacity innovation is the key to Africa's transformation: with the appropriate catalysts, innovation and transformation are but a matter of time in gestation. The first of two major catalysts necessary to prompting this change so long sought by Africans came at the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It is one of the most profound collaborations of African Heads of State. The second catalyst is proposed in this work in the form of the multinational corporation as change agent for the innovation process working in alliance with NEPAD as Africa's spokesperson for innovation. The policy framework for African capacity innovation is the material product along with discourse for redress of corruption and security policy narrative for protecting the assets of multinational corporations. Bringing Forth Prosperity: Capacity Innovation in Africa questions capital theory as a development construct and an appropriate platform upon which sustained capacity innovation in Africa may emerge; explores Africa's road to modernity in the context of selected development constructs and assesses capacity innovation from a top down-bottom up perspective purposely to serve as backdrop to the Africa-MNC strategic alliance framework; constructs country capacity ID to identify internal resources available to African countries to support capacity innovation; conceptualizes the Africa-MNC strategic alliance to convey a capacity innovation philosophy; articulates an African capacity innovation policy framework to guide the Alliance through a series of actions designed to prompt innovation activity and set the continent on a course to sustained transformation; and articulates a scheme to protect assets -human and physical- derived through the Africa-MNC strategic alliance.","","9788793519282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228744.pdf&bkn=9218861&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is “carried” on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer. Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves focusses on recent technologies and applications of the WPT via radio waves in far field. The book also covers the history, and future, of WPT via radio waves, as well as safety, EMC and coexistence of radio waves for WPT.

"2 Manual Analog-Centric Design Style(s)","S. Weber; C. Duarte",NA; NA,"Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations Statistical Methods and Optimization","","2017","","","63","132","Circuit Design = Science + Art! Designers need a skilled """"gut feeling"""" about circuits and related analytical techniques, plus creativity, to solve all problems and to adhere to the specifications, the written and the unwritten ones. You must anticipate a large number of influences, like temperature effects, supply voltages changes, offset voltages, layout parasitics, and numerous kinds of technology variations to end up with a circuit that works. This is challenging for analog, custom-digital, mixed-signal or RF circuits, and often researching new design methods in relevant journals, conference proceedings and design tools unfortunately gives the impression that just a """"wild bunch"""" of """"advanced techniques"""" exist. On the other hand, state-of-the-art tools nowadays indeed offer a good cockpit to steer the design flow, which include clever statistical methods and optimization techniques. Actually, this almost presents a second breakthrough, like the introduction of circuit simulators 40 years ago! Users can now conveniently analyse all the problems (discover, quantify, verify), and even exploit them, for example for optimization purposes. Most designers are caught up on everyday problems, so we fit that """"wild bunch"""" into a systematic approach for variation-aware design, a designer's field guide and more. That is where this book can help! Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations starts with best-practise manual methods and links them tightly to up-to-date automation algorithms. We provide many tractable examples and explain key techniques you have to know. We then enable you to select and setup suitable methods for each design task - knowing their prerequisites, advantages and, as too often overlooked, their limitations as well. The good thing with computers is that you yourself can often verify amazing things with little effort, and you can use software not only to your direct advantage in solving a specific problem, but also for becoming a better skilled, more experienced engineer. Unfortunately, EDA design environments are not good at all to learn about advanced numerics. So with this book we also provide two apps for learning about statistic and optimization directly with circuit-related examples, and in real-time so without the long simulation times. This helps to develop a healthy statistical gut feeling for circuit design. The book is written for engineers, students in engineering and CAD / methodology experts. Readers should have some background in standard design techniques like entering a design in a schematic capture and simulating it, and also know about major technology aspects.","","9788793379763","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228057.pdf&bkn=9218893&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"3 Morphological Features, Development Cycle, and Interaction with Cells","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","13","16","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics.

Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail.

In this context """"desalination"""", defined as """"the removal of salt from water"""", is one of the possible solutions for overcoming our planet's municipal and industrial thirst. By drawing upon the authoritative expertise of a remarkable team of international authors, this book aims to provide an encompassing and """"multidisciplinary"""" introduction to various aspects of desalination. The forte of this publication is that it does not overtly focus on a particular sub-topic of desalination, but rather addresses the topic as a whole. In other words, the unique assortment of reader-friendly chapters is designed to strike a delicate balance between the technical and non-technical. The book is divided into five general sections: • The first section presents an overview of water scarcity, followed by a review of integrated water management and the alternatives to desalination. The fundamentals of desalination are provided, including simple water chemistry; • The second section covers the conventional technologies of today, including thermal and membrane desalination processes. The topics of pre- and post- treatment are given due credit, as no desalination plant can operate without them; • The third section reviews the history of how desalination technologies originated, including a review of today's R&D activities and cutting edge research. The processes and engineering applied for membrane manufacturing are also presented; • Section four is concerned with energy and environmental issues, including the application of renewable and nuclear energy, minimization of energy usage and the water-energy-nexus, brine management, and environmental impacts; • Finally, section five covers the social and commercial issues, ranging from rural desalination, to the politics of desalination. Desalination costs and feasibility are presented, as well as issues in business development and the future market prospects. • Effectively, A Multidisciplinary Introduction to Desalination aims to be a holistic go-to-compendium for anyone seeking a balanced understanding of the various facets of desalination","","9788793379534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228592.pdf&bkn=9218871&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Capacity innovation is the key to Africa's transformation: with the appropriate catalysts, innovation and transformation are but a matter of time in gestation. The first of two major catalysts necessary to prompting this change so long sought by Africans came at the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It is one of the most profound collaborations of African Heads of State. The second catalyst is proposed in this work in the form of the multinational corporation as change agent for the innovation process working in alliance with NEPAD as Africa's spokesperson for innovation. The policy framework for African capacity innovation is the material product along with discourse for redress of corruption and security policy narrative for protecting the assets of multinational corporations.

"13 Sensitivity to Antibiotics and Treatment","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","239","250","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle. The scientific topics discussed include: • Biological, morphological and immunological properties of Coxiella burnetii • Diagnosis, clinical forms and manifestations, pathologic changes • Epidemiology of Q fever in animals and humans • Prevention and Control","","9788793519480","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228434.pdf&bkn=9218874&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
"3 Towards an Analytical Policy Framework for Assessing Capacity Innovation: A Standalone African Perspective*","B. F. Bobo",NA,"Bringing Forth Prosperity: Capacity Innovation in Africa","","2017","","","23","56","Path to Capacity Innovation: An Africa-MNC Strategic Alliance, a policy framework is advanced proposing a strategic alliance between African countries -represented by NEPAD- and the multinational corporation with input from the NGO and couched upon an NEPAD-MNC-NGO cross-fertilizing integrative structure. Capacity innovation is the key to Africa's transformation: with the appropriate catalysts, innovation and transformation are but a matter of time in gestation. The first of two major catalysts necessary to prompting this change so long sought by Africans came at the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It is one of the most profound collaborations of African Heads of State. The second catalyst is proposed in this work in the form of the multinational corporation as change agent for the innovation process working in alliance with NEPAD as Africa's spokesperson for innovation. The policy framework for African capacity innovation is the material product along with discourse for redress of corruption and security policy narrative for protecting the assets of multinational corporations. Bringing Forth Prosperity: Capacity Innovation in Africa questions capital theory as a development construct and an appropriate platform upon which sustained capacity innovation in Africa may emerge; explores Africa's road to modernity in the context of selected development constructs and assesses capacity innovation from a top down-bottom up perspective purposely to serve as backdrop to the Africa-MNC strategic alliance framework; constructs country capacity ID to identify internal resources available to African countries to support capacity innovation; conceptualizes the Africa-MNC strategic alliance to convey a capacity innovation philosophy; articulates an African capacity innovation policy framework to guide the Alliance through a series of actions designed to prompt innovation activity and set the continent on a course to sustained transformation; and articulates a scheme to protect assets -human and physical- derived through the Africa-MNC strategic alliance.","","9788793519282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228745.pdf&bkn=9218861&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This is challenging for analog, custom-digital, mixed-signal or RF circuits, and often researching new design methods in relevant journals, conference proceedings and design tools unfortunately gives the impression that just a """"wild bunch"""" of """"advanced techniques"""" exist.

"About the Editor","",,"Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves","","2017","","","301","302","Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is considered to be an innovative game changing technology. The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is “carried” on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer. Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves focusses on recent technologies and applications of the WPT via radio waves in far field. The book also covers the history, and future, of WPT via radio waves, as well as safety, EMC and coexistence of radio waves for WPT. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Radio Wave Generation • Radio Wave Amplification with Solid States Circuit and Microwave Tubes • Antenna and Beam Forming Technologies • Radio Wave Conversion/Rectification to Electricity • Battery-less Sensor Applications toward Internet of Things (IoT) • Solar Power Satellite Application • Safety, EMC, Coexistence of Radio Waves for the WPT WPT is an old technology based on the basic theory of radio waves, however WPT is also a state-of-the-art technology for the latest applications in IoT, sensor networks, wireless chargers for mobile phones, and solar power satellite.

"11 The Finite Difference Method","W. Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","115","120","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Electromagnetic Field Equations • Constitutive Relations • Discretization and Numerical Analysis • Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods • Design of Integrated Passive Components","","9788793519831","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228450.pdf&bkn=9218768&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"13 The Finite Volume Method and Finite Surface Method","W. Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","129","186","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Electromagnetic Field Equations • Constitutive Relations • Discretization and Numerical Analysis • Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods • Design of Integrated Passive Components","","9788793519831","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228519.pdf&bkn=9218768&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

You must anticipate a large number of influences, like temperature effects, supply voltages changes, offset voltages, layout parasitics, and numerous kinds of technology variations to end up with a circuit that works. This is challenging for analog, custom-digital, mixed-signal or RF circuits, and often researching new design methods in relevant journals, conference proceedings and design tools unfortunately gives the impression that just a """"wild bunch"""" of """"advanced techniques"""" exist. On the other hand, state-of-the-art tools nowadays indeed offer a good cockpit to steer the design flow, which include clever statistical methods and optimization techniques. Actually, this almost presents a second breakthrough, like the introduction of circuit simulators 40 years ago!

Most designers are caught up on everyday problems, so we fit that """"wild bunch"""" into a systematic approach for variation-aware design, a designer's field guide and more. That is where this book can help! Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations starts with best-practise manual methods and links them tightly to up-to-date automation algorithms. We provide many tractable examples and explain key techniques you have to know. We then enable you to select and setup suitable methods for each design task - knowing their prerequisites, advantages and, as too often overlooked, their limitations as well. The good thing with computers is that you yourself can often verify amazing things with little effort, and you can use software not only to your direct advantage in solving a specific problem, but also for becoming a better skilled, more experienced engineer. Unfortunately, EDA design environments are not good at all to learn about advanced numerics. So with this book we also provide two apps for learning about statistic and optimization directly with circuit-related examples, and in real-time so without the long simulation times. This helps to develop a healthy statistical gut feeling for circuit design. The book is written for engineers, students in engineering and CAD / methodology experts.

Capacity innovation is the key to Africa's transformation: with the appropriate catalysts, innovation and transformation are but a matter of time in gestation. The first of two major catalysts necessary to prompting this change so long sought by Africans came at the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It is one of the most profound collaborations of African Heads of State. The second catalyst is proposed in this work in the form of the multinational corporation as change agent for the innovation process working in alliance with NEPAD as Africa's spokesperson for innovation. The policy framework for African capacity innovation is the material product along with discourse for redress of corruption and security policy narrative for protecting the assets of multinational corporations. Bringing Forth Prosperity: Capacity Innovation in Africa questions capital theory as a development construct and an appropriate platform upon which sustained capacity innovation in Africa may emerge; explores Africa's road to modernity in the context of selected development constructs and assesses capacity innovation from a top down-bottom up perspective purposely to serve as backdrop to the Africa-MNC strategic alliance framework; constructs country capacity ID to identify internal resources available to African countries to support capacity innovation; conceptualizes the Africa-MNC strategic alliance to convey a capacity innovation philosophy; articulates an African capacity innovation policy framework to guide the Alliance through a series of actions designed to prompt innovation activity and set the continent on a course to sustained transformation; and articulates a scheme to protect assets -human and physical- derived through the Africa-MNC strategic alliance.","","9788793519282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228719.pdf&bkn=9218861&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"About the Editor","",,"A Multidisciplinary Introduction to Desalination","","2017","","","659","660","Although more than 70% of the globe is covered with water, only a small portion is suitable for direct human use, making the scarcity of freshwater one of our plant's most serious challenges. In this context """"desalination"""", defined as """"the removal of salt from water"""", is one of the possible solutions for overcoming our planet's municipal and industrial thirst. By drawing upon the authoritative expertise of a remarkable team of international authors, this book aims to provide an encompassing and """"multidisciplinary"""" introduction to various aspects of desalination. The forte of this publication is that it does not overtly focus on a particular sub-topic of desalination, but rather addresses the topic as a whole. In other words, the unique assortment of reader-friendly chapters is designed to strike a delicate balance between the technical and non-technical. The book is divided into five general sections: • The first section presents an overview of water scarcity, followed by a review of integrated water management and the alternatives to desalination. The fundamentals of desalination are provided, including simple water chemistry; • The second section covers the conventional technologies of today, including thermal and membrane desalination processes. The topics of pre- and post- treatment are given due credit, as no desalination plant can operate without them; • The third section reviews the history of how desalination technologies originated, including a review of today's R&D activities and cutting edge research. The processes and engineering applied for membrane manufacturing are also presented; • Section four is concerned with energy and environmental issues, including the application of renewable and nuclear energy, minimization of energy usage and the water-energy-nexus, brine management, and environmental impacts; • Finally, section five covers the social and commercial issues, ranging from rural desalination, to the politics of desalination. Desalination costs and feasibility are presented, as well as issues in business development and the future market prospects. • Effectively, A Multidisciplinary Introduction to Desalination aims to be a holistic go-to-compendium for anyone seeking a balanced understanding of the various facets of desalination","","9788793379534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228658.pdf&bkn=9218871&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is “carried” on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer. Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves focusses on recent technologies and applications of the WPT via radio waves in far field. The book also covers the history, and future, of WPT via radio waves, as well as safety, EMC and coexistence of radio waves for WPT.

"About the Authors","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","317","318","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

This is owing to a steady expansion of the range of enabling devices and technologies, as well as the need for seamless solutions for location-based services. Besides localization accuracy, a common requirement for emerging solutions is that they are cost-abstemious, both in terms of the financial and computational cost. Hence, development of localization strategies from already deployed technologies, e.g., from different terrestrial radio frequency sources is of great practical interest. Amongst other, these include localization strategies based on received signal strength (RSS), time of arrival, angle of arrival (AoA) or a combination of them. RSS-AoA-based Target Localization and Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks presents recent advances in developing algorithms for target localization and tracking, reflecting the state-of-the-art algorithms and research achievements in target localization and tracking based on hybrid (RSS-AoA) measurements.

Since RF circuits have several unique features, and all analysis methods are based on the circuit essential properties, the book begins by describing the properties of RF circuits, characterization of circuits with customary and uncustomary behavior and some theorems of solutions existence and uniqueness for dynamic nonlinear circuits. Thereafter, the main time domain and frequency domain analysis methods for RF circuits are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of each method have been highlighted, and an algorithm for the time step choice in transient analysis based on energy balance errors is also presented. Lastly, the final part contains some nonlinear circuit models of power BAW resonators. The behavioral models for the time domain analysis are simple circuits containing weakly nonlinear elements. The behavioral models for frequency domain analysis are based on the measured values of the frequency dependent S parameters for a set of incident powers. S parameters corresponding to certain intermodulation products of practical interest are also considered.

The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is “carried” on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer.

The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is “carried” on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer. Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves focusses on recent technologies and applications of the WPT via radio waves in far field. The book also covers the history, and future, of WPT via radio waves, as well as safety, EMC and coexistence of radio waves for WPT.

"2 The Microscopic Maxwell Equations","W. Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","7","16","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented.

"7 Fast and High-Yield Estimation Techniques","S. Weber; C. Duarte",NA; NA,"Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations Statistical Methods and Optimization","","2017","","","315","376","Circuit Design = Science + Art! Designers need a skilled """"gut feeling"""" about circuits and related analytical techniques, plus creativity, to solve all problems and to adhere to the specifications, the written and the unwritten ones. You must anticipate a large number of influences, like temperature effects, supply voltages changes, offset voltages, layout parasitics, and numerous kinds of technology variations to end up with a circuit that works. This is challenging for analog, custom-digital, mixed-signal or RF circuits, and often researching new design methods in relevant journals, conference proceedings and design tools unfortunately gives the impression that just a """"wild bunch"""" of """"advanced techniques"""" exist. On the other hand, state-of-the-art tools nowadays indeed offer a good cockpit to steer the design flow, which include clever statistical methods and optimization techniques. Actually, this almost presents a second breakthrough, like the introduction of circuit simulators 40 years ago! Users can now conveniently analyse all the problems (discover, quantify, verify), and even exploit them, for example for optimization purposes. Most designers are caught up on everyday problems, so we fit that """"wild bunch"""" into a systematic approach for variation-aware design, a designer's field guide and more. That is where this book can help! Circuit Design: Anticipate, Analyze, Exploit Variations starts with best-practise manual methods and links them tightly to up-to-date automation algorithms. We provide many tractable examples and explain key techniques you have to know. We then enable you to select and setup suitable methods for each design task - knowing their prerequisites, advantages and, as too often overlooked, their limitations as well. The good thing with computers is that you yourself can often verify amazing things with little effort, and you can use software not only to your direct advantage in solving a specific problem, but also for becoming a better skilled, more experienced engineer. Unfortunately, EDA design environments are not good at all to learn about advanced numerics. So with this book we also provide two apps for learning about statistic and optimization directly with circuit-related examples, and in real-time so without the long simulation times. This helps to develop a healthy statistical gut feeling for circuit design. The book is written for engineers, students in engineering and CAD / methodology experts. Readers should have some background in standard design techniques like entering a design in a schematic capture and simulating it, and also know about major technology aspects.","","9788793379763","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228058.pdf&bkn=9218893&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Since RF circuits have several unique features, and all analysis methods are based on the circuit essential properties, the book begins by describing the properties of RF circuits, characterization of circuits with customary and uncustomary behavior and some theorems of solutions existence and uniqueness for dynamic nonlinear circuits. Thereafter, the main time domain and frequency domain analysis methods for RF circuits are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of each method have been highlighted, and an algorithm for the time step choice in transient analysis based on energy balance errors is also presented. Lastly, the final part contains some nonlinear circuit models of power BAW resonators. The behavioral models for the time domain analysis are simple circuits containing weakly nonlinear elements. The behavioral models for frequency domain analysis are based on the measured values of the frequency dependent S parameters for a set of incident powers. S parameters corresponding to certain intermodulation products of practical interest are also considered. The physical models contain artificial transmission lines with nonlinear circuit elements corresponding to mechanical and electrical nonlinearities.","","9788793379459","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9227945.pdf&bkn=9218859&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","409","434","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Electromagnetic Field Equations • Constitutive Relations • Discretization and Numerical Analysis • Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods • Design of Integrated Passive Components","","9788793519831","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228544.pdf&bkn=9218768&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","39","70","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

Capacity innovation is the key to Africa's transformation: with the appropriate catalysts, innovation and transformation are but a matter of time in gestation. The first of two major catalysts necessary to prompting this change so long sought by Africans came at the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It is one of the most profound collaborations of African Heads of State. The second catalyst is proposed in this work in the form of the multinational corporation as change agent for the innovation process working in alliance with NEPAD as Africa's spokesperson for innovation. The policy framework for African capacity innovation is the material product along with discourse for redress of corruption and security policy narrative for protecting the assets of multinational corporations. Bringing Forth Prosperity: Capacity Innovation in Africa questions capital theory as a development construct and an appropriate platform upon which sustained capacity innovation in Africa may emerge; explores Africa's road to modernity in the context of selected development constructs and assesses capacity innovation from a top down-bottom up perspective purposely to serve as backdrop to the Africa-MNC strategic alliance framework; constructs country capacity ID to identify internal resources available to African countries to support capacity innovation; conceptualizes the Africa-MNC strategic alliance to convey a capacity innovation philosophy; articulates an African capacity innovation policy framework to guide the Alliance through a series of actions designed to prompt innovation activity and set the continent on a course to sustained transformation; and articulates a scheme to protect assets -human and physical- derived through the Africa-MNC strategic alliance.","","9788793519282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228703.pdf&bkn=9218861&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This trend in conjunction to the available technologies for providing advanced sensing, measurement, process control, and communication lead towards the new field of Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Cyber-physical systems are expected to play a major role in the design and development of future engineering platforms with new capabilities that far exceed today's levels of autonomy, functionality and usability. Although these systems exhibit remarkable characteristics, their design and implementation is a challenging issue, as numerous (heterogeneous) components and services have to be appropriately modeled and simulated together. The problem of designing efficient CPS becomes far more challenging in case the target system has to meet also real-time constraints. CyberPhysical Systems: Decision Making Mechanisms and Applications describes essential theory, recent research and large-scale usecases that addresses urgent challenges in CPS architectures. In particular, it includes chapters on: • Decision making for large scale CPS • Modeling of CPS with emphasis at the control mechanisms • Hardware/software implementation of the control mechanisms • Fault-tolerant and reliability issues for the control mechanisms • Cyberphysical user-cases that incorporate challenging decision making","","9788793609082","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228130.pdf&bkn=9218798&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

In this context """"desalination"""", defined as """"the removal of salt from water"""", is one of the possible solutions for overcoming our planet's municipal and industrial thirst. By drawing upon the authoritative expertise of a remarkable team of international authors, this book aims to provide an encompassing and """"multidisciplinary"""" introduction to various aspects of desalination. The forte of this publication is that it does not overtly focus on a particular sub-topic of desalination, but rather addresses the topic as a whole. In other words, the unique assortment of reader-friendly chapters is designed to strike a delicate balance between the technical and non-technical. The book is divided into five general sections: • The first section presents an overview of water scarcity, followed by a review of integrated water management and the alternatives to desalination. The fundamentals of desalination are provided, including simple water chemistry; • The second section covers the conventional technologies of today, including thermal and membrane desalination processes. The topics of pre- and post- treatment are given due credit, as no desalination plant can operate without them; • The third section reviews the history of how desalination technologies originated, including a review of today's R&D activities and cutting edge research. The processes and engineering applied for membrane manufacturing are also presented; • Section four is concerned with energy and environmental issues, including the application of renewable and nuclear energy, minimization of energy usage and the water-energy-nexus, brine management, and environmental impacts; • Finally, section five covers the social and commercial issues, ranging from rural desalination, to the politics of desalination. Desalination costs and feasibility are presented, as well as issues in business development and the future market prospects. • Effectively, A Multidisciplinary Introduction to Desalination aims to be a holistic go-to-compendium for anyone seeking a balanced understanding of the various facets of desalination","","9788793379534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228586.pdf&bkn=9218871&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"2 Etiology and Taxonomy","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","9","12","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

Capacity innovation is the key to Africa's transformation: with the appropriate catalysts, innovation and transformation are but a matter of time in gestation. The first of two major catalysts necessary to prompting this change so long sought by Africans came at the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It is one of the most profound collaborations of African Heads of State. The second catalyst is proposed in this work in the form of the multinational corporation as change agent for the innovation process working in alliance with NEPAD as Africa's spokesperson for innovation. The policy framework for African capacity innovation is the material product along with discourse for redress of corruption and security policy narrative for protecting the assets of multinational corporations. Bringing Forth Prosperity: Capacity Innovation in Africa questions capital theory as a development construct and an appropriate platform upon which sustained capacity innovation in Africa may emerge; explores Africa's road to modernity in the context of selected development constructs and assesses capacity innovation from a top down-bottom up perspective purposely to serve as backdrop to the Africa-MNC strategic alliance framework; constructs country capacity ID to identify internal resources available to African countries to support capacity innovation; conceptualizes the Africa-MNC strategic alliance to convey a capacity innovation philosophy; articulates an African capacity innovation policy framework to guide the Alliance through a series of actions designed to prompt innovation activity and set the continent on a course to sustained transformation; and articulates a scheme to protect assets -human and physical- derived through the Africa-MNC strategic alliance.","","9788793519282","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228739.pdf&bkn=9218861&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

"16 Evaluation of Coupled Inductors","W. Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","281","294","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Electromagnetic Field Equations • Constitutive Relations • Discretization and Numerical Analysis • Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods • Design of Integrated Passive Components","","9788793519831","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228464.pdf&bkn=9218768&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","327","340","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics.

"6 Far Field Energy Harvesting and Backscatter Communication","",,"Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves","","2017","","","141","172","Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is considered to be an innovative game changing technology. The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is “carried” on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer. Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves focusses on recent technologies and applications of the WPT via radio waves in far field. The book also covers the history, and future, of WPT via radio waves, as well as safety, EMC and coexistence of radio waves for WPT. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Radio Wave Generation • Radio Wave Amplification with Solid States Circuit and Microwave Tubes • Antenna and Beam Forming Technologies • Radio Wave Conversion/Rectification to Electricity • Battery-less Sensor Applications toward Internet of Things (IoT) • Solar Power Satellite Application • Safety, EMC, Coexistence of Radio Waves for the WPT WPT is an old technology based on the basic theory of radio waves, however WPT is also a state-of-the-art technology for the latest applications in IoT, sensor networks, wireless chargers for mobile phones, and solar power satellite.

Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","311","316","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

"1 Introduction","W. Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","1","6","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Electromagnetic Field Equations • Constitutive Relations • Discretization and Numerical Analysis • Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods • Design of Integrated Passive Components","","9788793519831","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228480.pdf&bkn=9218768&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Schoenmaker",NA,"Computational Electrodynamics: A Gauge Approach with Applications in Microelectronics","","2017","","","353","378","Computational Electrodynamics is a vast research field with a wide variety of tools. In physics the principle of gauge invariance plays a pivotal role as a guide towards a sensible formulation of the laws of nature as well as computing the properties of elementary particles using the lattice formulation of gauge theories, yet the gauge principle has played a much less pronounced role in performing computation in classical electrodynamics. In this work the author will demonstrate that starting from the gauge formulation of electrodynamics using the electromagnetic potentials leads to computational tools that can very well compete with the conventional electromagnetic field-based tools. Once accepting the formulation based on gauge fields, the computational code is very transparent due to the mimetic mapping of the electrodynamic variables on the computational grid. Although the illustrations and applications originate from microelectronic engineering, the method has a much larger range of applicability. Therefore this book is of interest to everyone having interest in computational electrodynamics. The volume is organized as follows: In part 1, a detailed introduction and overview is presented of the Maxwell equations as well as the derivation of the current and charge densities is different materials. Semiconductors are responding to electromagnetic fields in a non-linear way and the induced complications are discussed in detail. In part 2, the transition of the theory of electrodynamics, using the gauge potentials, to a formulation that can serve as the gateway to computational code is presented. In part 3, the feasibility and success of the methods of part 2 are demonstrated by a collection of microelectronic device designs. Part 4 focuses on a set of topical themes that brings the reader to the frontier of research in building the simulation tools using the gauge principle in computational electrodynamics. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • Electromagnetic Field Equations • Constitutive Relations • Discretization and Numerical Analysis • Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods • Design of Integrated Passive Components","","9788793519831","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9228550.pdf&bkn=9218768&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","20 Oct 2020","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

This is owing to a steady expansion of the range of enabling devices and technologies, as well as the need for seamless solutions for location-based services. Besides localization accuracy, a common requirement for emerging solutions is that they are cost-abstemious, both in terms of the financial and computational cost. Hence, development of localization strategies from already deployed technologies, e.g., from different terrestrial radio frequency sources is of great practical interest. Amongst other, these include localization strategies based on received signal strength (RSS), time of arrival, angle of arrival (AoA) or a combination of them. RSS-AoA-based Target Localization and Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks presents recent advances in developing algorithms for target localization and tracking, reflecting the state-of-the-art algorithms and research achievements in target localization and tracking based on hybrid (RSS-AoA) measurements.

"Introduction","S. P. Martinov",NA,"Q Fever","","2017","","","1","4","Information on the changing epidemiology and expanding nosological range of Q fever in humans has gained much attention in the past decade. Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious pathogen Coxiella burnetii and has global distribution with important health, social and economic implications. A number of other properties and characteristics of the causative agent and disease, define Q fever as a lasting and difficult veterinary and epidemiological problem, namely: the adaptability of C. burnetii and its high resistance in the external environment; the possibility of the existence of the agent in three- and two-member parasitic systems; the availability of natural and agricultural foci of infection; peculiarities of pathogenesis in humans and animals, and the mechanisms of excretion of the pathogen into the environment; and the high susceptibility of non-immune populations of animals and people. Given that C. burnetii is included in the arsenal of bacteriological weapons as agent with potential bioterrorist threat must be borne in mind the strategic importance of this microorganism. This book summarizes and analyzes the scientific facts and developments about Q Fever researched worldwide and performed by the author to propose a system for monitoring, control and prevention covering the main necessary actions, measures and activities in the fight against this fever. There is an uneven level of knowledge of Q fever in animals and humans in various countries on the planet, while the assessment of the relevance of the problem is often ambiguous and unrealistic in terms of veterinary, medical and social and economic aspects, which can result in an incomplete diagnosis, inaccurate information about the spread of disease and lack of purposeful struggle.

Through their contributions, the chapter authors in this book propose a new approach to actual and relevant topics of interest, generically called the hydrogen economy and civilization. Hydrogen vulnerabilities is a topic that includes new challenges that face the hydrogen energy market. Weaknesses for the hydrogen stakeholder are becoming more refined, and it is necessary to be an active and sensitive player to understand these. A prosperous development of hydrogen will require the assimilation of numerous, diverse and unfamiliar contexts. Challenges for hydrogen will not only be in scientific, technical, economical or public acceptance, but challenges also lie in the genesis of this topic and the neglect of some aspects, however marginal, which negatively influence the desired hydrogen developed. This book informs the reader about the status of hydrogen energy in the international market, and it includes a series of examples and case studies about hydrogen activities in various countries.

"Props Alive: A Framework for Augmented Reality Stop Motion Animation","L. Casas; M. Kosek; K.

Current stop motion movies introduced 3D printing processes in order to acquire animations more accurately and rapidly. However, due to the nature of this technique, every frame needs to be computer-generated, 3D printed and post-processed before it can be recorded. Therefore, a typical stop motion film could require many thousands of props to be created, resulting in a laborious and expensive production. We address this with a real-time interactive Augmented Reality system which generates virtual in-between poses according to a reduced number of key frame physical props. We perform deformation of the surface camera samples to accomplish smooth animations with retained visual appearance and incorporate a diminished reality method to allow virtual deformations that would, otherwise, reveal undesired background behind the animated mesh. Underpinning this solution is a principled interaction and system design which forms our Props Alive framework. We apply established models of interactive system design, drawing from an information visualisation framework which, appropriately for Augmented Reality, includes consideration of the user, interaction, data and presentation elements necessary for real-time. The rapid development framework and high performance architecture is detailed with an analysis of resulting performance.","2328-7829","978-1-5386-6274-8","10.1109/SEARIS41720.2017.9183487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183487","H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems—Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities;I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism—Animation;I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications","Real-time systems;Animation;Augmented reality;Strain;Cameras;Feeds;Three-dimensional displays","augmented reality;computer animation;data visualisation","static puppets;3D printing processes;key frame physical props;visual appearance;diminished reality method;virtual deformations;animated mesh;interactive system design;information visualisation;Props Alive;real-time interactive augmented reality system;stop motion film;stop motion movies;stop motion animation;virtual in-between poses;surface camera samples","","3","","7","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low latencies are required for VR to reduce perceptual artifacts and cyber sickness. Latency jitter, i.e. variance in the pattern of latency, prevent coping mechanisms as users can't adapt.Low latency is a fundamental timeliness requirement to reduce the potential risks of cyber sickness and to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and user experience of Virtual Reality Systems. The effects of uniform latency degradation based on mean or worst-case values are well researched. In contrast, the effects of latency jitter, the distribution pattern of latency changes over time has largely been ignored so far, although today's consumer VR systems are extremely vulnerable in this respect.In this paper, we propose to create a model of latency and latency jitter with empirical distributions as well as a method of using those models to inject latency. The process of creating a latency model is demonstrated with an example of gathering and converting latency samples from an example application. We show how to simulate latency and motivate to use it in middleware to allow for less intrusive latency effect evaluations.","2328-7829","978-1-5386-6274-8","10.1109/SEARIS41720.2017.9183433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183433","D.1.3 [Programming Techniques]: Concurrent Programming—Parallel programming;D.4.8 [Operating Systems]: Performance—Measurements;H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems—Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities","Jitter;Data models;Physics;Virtual reality;Middleware;Solid modeling;Time measurement","human factors;jitter;middleware;public domain software;virtual reality","latency simulation;cyber sickness;virtual reality systems;consumer VR systems;latency jitter simulation;OSVR;middleware","","","","19","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, the amount of data to be generated or processed by computer systems increases at a similar rate. Generating images using algorithms from computer graphics is a good example for such scenarios. Because visual analysis of data can greatly benefit from the usage of large, tiled display systems, and techniques to render images become more and more complex in order to generate visually pleasing results, using a single machine is often not sufficient to enable reasonable workflows.In this paper, we introduce a framework for cluster-based rendering and postprocessing. Distributing the generation and postprocessing of images to a cluster of machines allows to speed up these tasks. In particular, we aim at rendering images at high resolutions, e.g. for large display walls. To our knowledge, no other framework for distributed rendering is capable of postprocessing images in a distributed fashion without being limited to frame tiles.We present a software design that provides a simple interface for creating render sessions, enabling arbitrary applications to delegate the generation of images to a cluster. In addition to a simple configuration process, we intend to support platform interoperability. We focus on the design of a flexible and modular architecture in order to make the framework independent of rendering techniques and scheduling algorithms. Thus, these components should be interchangeable to enable a variety of use cases. The same applies to the integration of postprocessing methods.","2328-7829","978-1-5386-6274-8","10.1109/SEARIS41720.2017.9183510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183510","I.3.2 [Computer Graphics]: Graphics Systems—Distributed/network graphics","Rendering (computer graphics);Image resolution;Task analysis;Scheduling algorithms;Pipelines;Complexity theory;Clustering algorithms","data visualisation;image processing;open systems;rendering (computer graphics);software engineering","tiled display systems;visually pleasing results;reasonable workflows;distributed rendering;computer hardware;computer graphics;visual analysis;rendering techniques;scheduling algorithms;software design;image generation;image postprocessing","","","","13","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using pupil size as affective information, we review hitherto presented approaches for pupil-based interaction. Three approaches base on different mechanisms; pupil size changes produced by covertly attending towards a set of stimuli changing in brightness, changes in pupil diameter actively produced by the user, and those occurring automatically as a by-product of cognitive processes. While the first two approaches can produce effective but relatively slow target selections, the latter might allow faster selections, but has to be combined with other selection mechanisms. Reanalyzing two data sets obtained with this most promising approach of using cognitive processes as basis for pupil-based target selection, it turns out that despite of differences in task and brightness, signal dynamics are characterized by comparable latencies and effect sizes. These may lay the foundation for future investigations into pupil diameter changes accompanying object selection in human-robot interaction.

Statistical and evolutionary algorithm in the form of regression analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) were compared in their prediction performance. Both techniques performed brilliantly as indicated by the coefficient of correlation and visual inspection, however, ANN performed better. Analyzing the factors through the connection weights of ANN reported population to be the significant factor contributing more to how energy is consumed globally.

Complying with the three vs (i.e., velocity, volume and variety) of big data, the financial market is considered as a complex system comprised of many interacting high-frequency traders those make decisions based on the relative strengths of these interactions. Researchers have put substantial scholarly input to deal with these anomalies. From the big data perspective, anomaly detection in financial data has widely been ignored despite many organisations store, process and disseminate financial market data for interested customers to assist them to make informed decision abd create competitive advantages. Considering the presence of anomalies in voluminous data from myriad data sources may generate catastrophic decision through misunderstandings of market behaviour. Therefore, in this study, we applied a standard set of anomaly detection techniques, used in big data based on nearest-neighbours, clustering and statistical approaches, to detect rare anomalies present within the historical daily trading information for five years (i.e., 20092013) for each stock listed on the Australian Security Exchange (ASX). We also measured the performance of these anomaly detection techniques using a number of metrics to highlight the best performing algorithm.

Existing reposting analytics and prediction approaches mainly focus on factors related to the original information content and the social influence of the information publishers. However, online information diffuses by viral cascades instead of single-source broadcast in social network, which means some reposting behavior actually occurs in information propagators rather than the original publishers. In some social networks, users are allowed to comment when they repost, which represents their views and attitudes to the information they propagate. In this paper, we evaluate how emotional tendencies of information propagators influence future reposting.

In particular, given a snapshot observation of the rumor graph, how to accurately identify the initial source of the spreading? In the seminal work by Shah and Zaman in 2011, this statistical inference problem was formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and solved using a rumor centrality approach for graphs that are degree-regular. This however is optimal only if there are no boundary effects, e.g., the underlying number of susceptible vertices is countably infinite. In general, all practical real world networks are finite or exhibit complex spreading behavior, and therefore these boundary effects cannot be ignored. In this paper, we solve the constrained maximum likelihood estimation problem by a generalized rumor centrality for spreading in graphs with boundary effects. We derive a graph-theoretic characterization of the maximum likelihood estimator for degree-regular graphs with a single end vertex at its boundary and propose a message-passing algorithm that is near-optimal for graphs with more complex boundary consisting of multiple end vertices.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069152","","Maximum likelihood estimation;Tree graphs;Social network services;Maximum likelihood detection;Closed-form solutions;Probabilistic logic;Technological innovation","graph theory;inference mechanisms;maximum likelihood estimation;message passing;social networking (online)","boundary effects;graph-theoretic characterization;degree-regular graphs;message-passing algorithm;complex boundary;rumor source detection;finite graphs;information source;viral spreading;rumor spreading;online social networks;snapshot observation;rumor graph;statistical inference problem;maximum likelihood estimation;rumor centrality","","","","10","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detecting the community structure in a complex network is both a challenging and a computationally expensive task. In this paper, we present the HAMUHI-CODE, a novel fast heuristic algorithm for multiscale hierarchical community detection inspired on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique. We define a new structural similarity of vertices based on the classical cosine similarity by removing some vertices in order to increase the probability of identifying inter-cluster edges. Then we use the proposed structural similarity in a new agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that does not merge only clusters with maximal similarity as in the classical approach, but merges any cluster that does not meet a parameterized community definition with its most similar adjacent cluster. The algorithm computes all the similar clusters at the same time is checking if each cluster meets the parameterized community definition. It is done in linear time complexity in terms of the number of cluster in the iteration. Since a complex network is a sparse graph, our approach HAMUHI-CODE has a super-linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input in the worst-case scenario (if the clusters merge in pairs), making it suitable to be applied on large-scale complex networks. To test the properties and the efficiency of our algorithm we have conducted extensive experiments on real world and synthetic benchmark networks by comparing it to several baseline state-of-the-art algorithms.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069065","Community Detection;Large-scale Complex Network;Multi-scale;Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering;Structural Similarity","Clustering algorithms;Complex networks;Heuristic algorithms;Social network services;Image edge detection;Partitioning algorithms;Time complexity","complex networks;computational complexity;graph theory;iterative methods;network theory (graphs);pattern clustering;social networking (online)","fast heuristic algorithm;multiscale hierarchical community detection;complex systems;community structure detection;agglomerative hierarchical clustering;cosine similarity;super-linear time complexity;large-scale complex networks;inter-cluster edge identification;HAMUHI-CODE;sparse graph","","","","27","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Notably, retweet cascades provide two complementary information: (a) inter-retweet time intervals of retweets, and (b) diffusion of cascade over the underlying follower network. Using datasets from Twitter, we identify two types of cascades based on presence or absence of early peaks in their sequence of inter-retweet intervals. We identify multiple diffusion localities associated with a cascade as it propagates over the network. Our studies reveal the transition of a cascade to a new locality facilitated by pivotal users that are highly cascade dependent following saturation of current locality. We propose an analytical model to show co-occurrence of first peaks and cascade migration to a new locality as well as predict locality saturation from interretweet intervals. Finally, we validate these claims from empirical data showing co-occurrence of first peaks and migration with good accuracy; we obtain even better accuracy for successfully classifying saturated and non-saturated diffusion localities from inter-retweet intervals.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069115","Diffusion locality;inter-retweet intervals;cascade migration;pivotal user","Twitter;Sociology;Diffusion processes;Time series analysis;Computer science","social networking (online)","multiple diffusion localities;cascade dependent following saturation;cascade migration;interretweet intervals;Twitter follower network;retweet cascades;retweet temporal pattern;online social networking websites","","","","14","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Europe alone, over four million deaths a year (45% of all deaths) are caused by heart diseases [1]. In addition, chronic diseases are responsible for 70 % of United States deaths, and account for more than 75% of annual United States medical care cost [2]. For instance, Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVD) are considered the main cause for around 14.3% of total deaths in Denmark5, and it is the main cause for over 45% of the total death in Lebanon6. It is too costly to keep CVD patients under control locally within the vicinity of a healthcare unit. Thus, researchers recently started to realize the need for automated monitoring in health systems that are expected to reduce the overall death rate and cost associated with monitoring of patients. However, a general monitoring health system will not cover all diseases at once. Therefore, there is a pushing necessity for monitoring health systems which are dedicated to specific health cases. To contribute to the ongoing efforts, this work develops an automated system which could be customized for various chronic diseases. A mobile application based solution is proposed. Further, the work concentrates on CVD by conducting a survey in Lebanon to investigate the acceptance and awareness of ECG for remote monitoring of patients. The results are promising and reflect how specialists are aware of the need to utilize the rapid development in technology combined with the widespread usage of mobile phone which may be used as the main device to guarantee 24/7 communication link for ECG. Adopting ECG in the healthcare system will allow for capturing some valuable data which could guide the development of a recommendation system. This will issue necessary alerts to specialists and guidance to patients and their careers so that specialists could attend to the case on timely basis and patients with their careers could follow the recommendations to keep the case under control until the specialist becomes available. Finally, a secure forum based communication system will be developed to allow patients to share their experience and specialists to provide consultancy and guidance on demand.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069163","chronic disease;remote monitoring;ECG;CVD;mobile application","Diseases;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Heart;Web servers;Social network services","blood vessels;diseases;electrocardiography;health care;medical diagnostic computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;telemedicine","ECG;remote monitoring;secure forum based communication system;mobile electrocardiogram;chronic diseases;blood vessels;heart diseases;cardiovascular diseases;CVD patients;automated monitoring;general monitoring health system","","","","20","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to take into account the fact that the role of the nodes vary through time, several adaptations of this concept have been proposed to time-evolving networks. However, these definitions are demanding in terms of computational cost, as they call for the computation of time-ordered paths. We propose a definition of centrality in link streams which is node-centric, in the sense that we only take into account the direct neighbors of a node to compute its centrality. This restriction allows to carry out the computation in a shorter time compared to a case where any couple of nodes in the network should be considered. Tests on empirical data show that this measure is relatively highly correlated to the number of times a node would relay information in a flooding process. We suggest that this is a good indication that this measurement can be of use in practical contexts where a node has a limited knowledge of its environment, such as routing protocols in delay tolerant networks.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069155","","Relays;Social network services;Computational efficiency;Knowledge engineering;Delays;Routing protocols","delay tolerant networks;routing protocols","link streams;direct neighbors;delay tolerant networks;ego-betweenness centrality;time-evolving networks;computational cost;time-ordered paths;flooding process","","","","28","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important component in measuring the scientific productivity of a researcher has been the number and citation count of his publications. However, that citation based measures of scientific productivity are influenced by domain specific factors like the popularity of the research domain, the key topics within the domain, as well as temporal factors like aging, these measures may not suitably reflect the contribution of a researcher uniformly across all domains. In this paper, we introduce social trust on a researcher in a given domain as a measure of his scientific productivity and success. We argue that trust in scientific domain is a social component that indicates the productivity and can influence several parameters like the collaborations of the researchers as well as the citations received by their publications. Unlike citation count of publications, trust is not domain specific and hence can be used uniformly across all domains to measure the scientific productivity.Our proposed measure of trust relies on a trust-based network of authors (nodes), where a link between two nodes is based on social indicators like co-authorship and citation counts. We validate the correctness as well as effectiveness of our proposed approach empirically using the ArnetMiner dataset. Observations indicate that the proposed measure not only mitigates the aging issues prevalent in citation based measures but can also predict the possibility of future success of the researchers in terms of citation count.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069118","Scientific productivity;collaboration network;trust;citation;complex network","Productivity;Aging;Bibliometrics;Collaboration;Australia;Physics;Indexes","citation analysis;trusted computing","social trust;scientific productivity;citation count;trust-based network","","","","29","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We send distances information to nodes and update distances of edges constantly, based on previous values and the unified model, which is introduced to quantify different influences from nodes and edges. It ends until the distances are stable. Then we remove some special edges from the original graph and get all subgraphs, which are the community partitions. It still inherits the advantage of uncovering small communities and outliers. Experiments based on synthetic networks and real world networks, show that our algorithm execute more efficient than stand-alone version. Since it is based on the Spark platform and designed in parallelization, the algorithm is very suitable for large datasets. We also provide a novel method taking use of double summation to calculate the NMI value of community partition result and the embedded community structure. Compared with the traditional way, it is not only as accurate as the traditional way and more efficient, but also has less space complexity.

The goal is to detect if and how changes in social structural variables may influence the quality of the knowledge produced by online knowledge production sites. The paper addresses such question by an extensive data analysis carried out on the datasets of two representative sites: Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. Results from the analysis show that on Stack Overflow both unevenness and elite stickiness have a curvilinear effect on quality. Quality is optimized at specific levels of elite stickiness and unevenness. At the same time, on Wikipedia, quality increases linearly with a decline on entropy, overall, and with an increase in stickiness in the maturation phase, after an entropy peak is reached.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069088","Wikipedia;Stack Overflow;Unevenness;Elite Stickiness;Quality of Content","Production;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Entropy;Collaboration","data analysis;entropy;Internet;knowledge management;Web sites","Wikipedia;online knowledge production sites;Stack Overflow;productive members;week-by-week value changes;elite resilience;content quality;unevenness;elite stickiness","","","","30","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our work presented here constitutes the first step in opening the black-box of vector embeddings for tweets.Traditional feature engineering methods for high-level applications have exploited various elementary properties of tweets. We believe that a tweet representation is effective for an application because it meticulously encodes the application-specific elementary properties of tweets. To understand the elementary properties encoded in a tweet representation, we evaluate the representations on the accuracy to which they can model each of those properties such as tweet length, presence of particular words, hashtags, mentions, capitalization, etc.Our systematic extensive study of nine supervised and four unsupervised tweet representations against most popular eight textual and five social elementary properties reveal that Bi-directional LSTMs (BLSTMs) and Skip-Thought Vectors (STV) best encode the textual and social properties of tweets respectively. FastText is the best model for low resource settings, providing very little degradation with reduction in embedding size.

SNA measures including degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality are used to probe into the impact of ties between actors of accidents. The empirical analysis shows that `Passenger vehicle' with degree centrality of 7513 has the highest degree of accidents, explaining 41.12% of total accidents. In addition, it is involved in 57.42% of accidents when accidents occur between same types of vehicles. `Sport utility/station wagon' and `taxi' rank second and third in this category with degree values of 4657 and 1454 respectively. It is also found that `driver inattention' holds the pivotal place when violations leading to accidents are concerned. It accounts for 19.09% accidents in general and 44.58% when accidents, where both parties commit the same violation, are considered. `Failure to yield right-of-way' and `following too closely' are ranked second and third.

In this paper, we use supervised learning, textual semantic similarity and community detection techniques to find actively discussed policy agenda sub-topics among political tweets within a certain time period. Specifically, we target tweets pertaining to major policy agendas published by state representatives in US, to try and discern the major policy sub-topics that they address using their twitter accounts.

However most of the research so far has been on static networks. In this paper, we address the problem of community detection in evolving social networks. As social networks evolve, the community structure of the network can change. How can the community structure be updated in an efficient way? How often should community structure be updated? We give two methods based on the Louvain algorithm, to determine when to update the community structure. The first method, called the Edge-Distribution-Analysis algorithm, analyzes the newly added edges in order to make this decision. The second method, called the Modularity-Change-Rate algorithm, finds the rate of modularity change in a given network, and uses it to predict whether or not an update is required.Due to the sparsity of real datasets of evolving networks, we propose three models to generate evolving networks: a Random model, a model based on the well-known phenomenon of homophily in social networks, and another based on the phenomenon of triadic and cyclic closure. Starting with real-world data sets, we used these models to generate evolving networks. We evaluated the Edge-Distribution-Analysis algorithm and Modularity-Change-Rate algorithm on these data sets. Our results show that both our methods predict quite well when the community structure should be updated. They result in significant computational savings compared to approaches that would update the community structure after a fixed number of edge additions, while ensuring that the quality of the community structure is comparable.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069125","","Social networking (online);Image edge detection;Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Switches;Detection algorithms;Computational modeling","complex networks;social networking (online)","community detection;evolving networks;social networks;static networks;edge-distribution-analysis algorithm;modularity-change-rate algorithm;Louvain algorithm","","","","20","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel technique for sorting a corpus of news articles based on two competing semantic objectives. Solving this multi-objective optimization problem yields a pareto front with a finite set of solution articles.

We say a graph G is distance preserving if there exists an isometric subgraph of every possible order up to the order of G. Distance preserving property has been applied to many real world problems such as route recommendation systems and all kinds of shortest-path-related applications. Here, we propose a biologically-inspired search algorithm to address the problem of finding isometric subgraphs that consequently determines if a given graph is distance preserving. In this algorithm, using a well defined fitness function, selection operator selects almost isometric subgraphs to generate the offspring for the next generation. There is a trade-off between the population size and searching speed. On one hand, the larger the population size is, the slower the search algorithm would be. On the other hand, by increasing the population size, we increase the likelihood of finding an existing isometric subgraph. Experimental results depict the performance of the proposed algorithm in finding isometric subgraphs even for challenging problems, and interestingly by these results one can see that ""almost"" all graphs are distance preserving. In closing, we show the smallest distance preserving graph whose product factors are not distance preserving. This graph has 80 vertices, and can be used as benchmark for algorithms in this concept.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069154","Distance preserving;evolutionary algorithm;isometric subgraphs;mutation rate;population size;selection operator","Sociology;Statistics;Biological cells;Social network services;Computer science;Evolutionary computation","evolutionary computation;graph theory;search problems","search algorithm;searching speed;isometric subgraph;weighted graph distance preserving property;distance preserving graph;evolutionary framework","","","","24","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Involving NGOs in management activities, as representatives of citizens and stakeholders can be critical for a successful enforcement of conservation activities, contributing to a better information flow within the management network. Nevertheless, integrating NGOs in management activities coordinated by public bodies is a challenging task, mostly due the dominant top-down approach, with no shared responsibilities with other actors. To evaluate the public participation in management of Natura 2000 sites, we compare public perception data with social network analysis around administration of Iron Gates Natural Park (SW Romania) and overlapped Natura 2000 protected areas. By applying a survey in 2012 and 2016 to local people, we observed an increasing trend of awareness regarding the protected area and conservation activities carried out by the administration. However, we identified lower percentages regarding the level of participation in activities of the protected area. The social network analysis applied to management actors and relationships between them revealed a marginal position of NGOs involved in Iron Gates Natural Park management, and as well a lack of coordination of these NGOs. Our paper highlights the low level of collaboration between different types of institutions involved in environmental management. Our social network analysis results illustrate the actual collaboration relationships between stakeholders, critical findings in achieving established management objectives. Public bodies and NGOs should make progress by addressing both ecological and societal issues in the management of Natura 2000 sites, in order to ensure sustainability, raise trust and maintain long-term viability of natural and cultural heritage.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069110","Hotspot;NGO;Natura 2000 network;environmental management","Social networking (online);Organizations;Iron;Logic gates;Sociology;Statistics;Stakeholders","decision making;ecology;environmental management;organisational aspects;social network theory;sustainable development","public participation;NGOs;management activities;conservation activities;management network;Natura 2000 sites;Iron Gates Natural Park management;environmental management;protected areas management;social network analysis;sustainability","","","","13","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We characterize users with a behavioral feature vector which consists of (well-studied in isolation) metadata-, content-, temporal-, and network-based features. We identify a random bot from our seed bank, populated initially by previously-labeled bots, gather this user's followers' features from Twitter in real time, and employ an unsupervised ensemble anomaly detection method in the multi-dimensional behavioral space. These potential bots are folded into the seed bank and the process is then repeated, with the new seeds' features allowing us to adaptively identify novel bot behavior. BotWalk allows for the identification of on average 6,000 potential bots a day.

The closeness centrality measure assigns a centrality value to each node based on its accessibility to the whole network. In real life applications, we are mainly interested in ranking nodes based on their centrality values. The classical method to compute the rank of a node first computes the closeness centrality of all nodes and then compares them to get its rank. Its time complexity is O(n·m+n), where n represents total number of nodes, and m represents total number of edges in the network. In the present work, we propose a heuristic method to fast estimate the closeness rank of a node in O(α · m) time complexity, where α = 3. We also propose an extended improved method using uniform sampling technique. This method better estimates the rank and it has the time complexity O(α·m), where α ≈ 10-100. This is an excellent improvement over the classical centrality ranking method. The efficiency of the proposed methods is verified on real world scalefree social networks using absolute and weighted error functions.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069090","","Social networking (online);Time complexity;Logistics;Estimation;Collaboration;Communication networks","complex networks;computational complexity;graph theory;network theory (graphs);social networking (online)","closeness centrality ranking;closeness centrality measure;centrality value;classical method;heuristic method;closeness rank;extended improved method;classical centrality ranking method;world scalefree social networks;uniform sampling technique","","2","","19","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This situation has encouraged a number of researchers to attempt to exploit alternative sources of data in order to derive estimates, including mobile phone data, which offers a rich depiction of the social dynamics of a population. Meanwhile, from the level of the individual to the city, access to information has been posited as an important factor in determining prosperity and economic development. In this paper we explore this relationship by simulating the flow of information through a mobile phone call graph in two sub-Saharan countries. We find a strong relationship between a location’s average wealth and its access to information as determined by the simulations in one country, and a weaker correlation in the second country. This finding adds to recent evidence that mining patterns from mobile phone data represents a viable means to estimate poverty in places where traditionally derived estimates are lacking. We further investigate the impact of various factors on the empirical results in order to explain the variation between the two countries.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069096","","Biological system modeling;Social network services;Economics;Mobile handsets;Urban areas;Sociology;Statistics","data mining;economics;mobile computing;socio-economic effects","information diffusion;economic development;socioeconomic status;comprehensive surveying;mobile phone data;social dynamics;mobile phone call graph;sub-Saharan countries;mining patterns","","","","52","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, time and space complexities of state of the art algorithms limit their scalability to medium-sized graphs. We propose SToC (for Semantic-Topological Clustering), a fast and scalable algorithm for partitioning large attributed graphs. The approach is robust, being compatible both with categorical and with quantitative attributes, and it is tailorable, allowing the user to weight the semantic and topological components. Further, the approach does not require the user to guess in advance the number of clusters. SToC relies on well known approximation techniques such as bottom-k sketches, traditional graph-theoretic concepts, and a new perspective on the composition of heterogeneous distance measures. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to efficiently compute high-quality partitions of large scale attributed graphs.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069120","","Semantics;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Social network services;Complexity theory;Robustness;Network topology","computational complexity;graph theory;pattern clustering","semantic attributes;Semantic-Topological Clustering;quantitative attributes;semantic components;topological components;attributed graphs;categorical attributes","","","","38","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, some unethical firms hire fake reviewers to generate biased positive reviews to promote their product and to damage the product reputations of their competitors. From the point of view of online product review platform providers, it is essential to keep the platform neutral and unbiased by detecting fake reviews and preventing fake reviewers from spreading biased reviews. In the current study, we attempt to use temporal and sentiment analyses as cues to separate fake reviews from authentic product reviews. Real case data of fake reviews in Taiwan was used for this temporal and sentiment analysis. Based on the analysis results, we find that fake reviewers usually generated and replied to fake reviewers during normal work hours. In contrast, ordinary users only generated and replied to a small proportion of normal product reviews during work hours. They generated and replied to normal product reviews the most during off-work hours and weekends. Additionally, the current study also revealed that more than half of fake reviewers replied others’ responses to their own fake reviews no later than within one day. The research results revealed that temporal and sentiment analyses have the potential to serve as cues to detect fake reviews and fake reviewers.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069102","Spammers;Fake Reviewers;Fake Review;Temporal Analysis;Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment analysis;Companies;Manuals;Twitter;Mobile handsets;Servers","consumer behaviour;Internet;purchasing;sentiment analysis","fake reviews;sentimental analysis;online product review platform;purchasing decisions","","","","25","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, we present datumPIPE, a system that allows for the generation of data that satisfies a set of integrity constraints, including functional dependencies (FDs), conditional functional dependencies (CFDs), and inclusion dependencies (INDs).

Adoption of pain medications and safe healthcare practices is a major global policy concern. This adoption process is highly influenced by the interpersonal network of physicians prescribing medications to treat pain. However, existing research into physician networks have been hospital-specific, applied to a smaller number of physicians, and dependent upon physicians' self-reports. In this paper, using big-data and data-mining, we overcome these limitations: By using a case of 30+ hospitals spanning across 2000+ physicians, we create a social network containing physicians' prescription data and adoption behavior of pain medications. The social network assumes that connected physicians work in the same hospital and belong to the same specialty or specialty group. Then, using the centrality measures, degree and eigenvector centrality, we analyze prescription volumes and proportion of adopters of pain medications. We also analyze gender effects. Results revealed that the most influential physicians were not the high-volume prescribers. Male physicians were more influential compared to female physicians; however, females prescribed more volume compared to males. Our results help us identify critical physicians from certain core specialties and specialty groups who may be approached by patients seeking pain relief.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069084","Social network analysis;eigenvector centrality;gender;pain medications","Social network services;Pain;Hospitals;Technological innovation;Data mining;Government","Big Data;data mining;diseases;health care;hospitals;medical computing;patient care;patient treatment;social network theory","pain medications;interpersonal network;Big Data;data mining;pain relief;social-network analysis;chronic pain;hospital;pain treatment;physicians prescription data;adoption behavior","","","","23","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC).

We propose a semi-supervised collaborative ranking model, dubbed S2COR, to improve the quality of cold-start item recommendation. S2COR mitigates the sparsity issue by leveraging side information about both observed and missing ratings by collaboratively learning the ranking model. This enables it to deal with the case of data missing not at random, but to also effectively incorporate the available side information in transduction. We experimentally evaluated our proposed algorithm on a number of challenging real-world datasets and compared our results against state-of-the-art models for cold-start recommendation.

Collective classification methods use both structure and attributes, often by aggregating data from neighbors of a node and learning a model on the aggregated data. In social networks, the degree distribution of nodes follows a power law where few nodes have many neighbors. High degree nodes have incoming links from low degree nodes of different classes and many nodes have very few edges. Hence, using only local structure may lead to poor predictions. Also, many social networks allow for different types of interactions (retweet, reply, like, etc.) that affect classification differently. This article proposes a collective classification method that makes use of the structure of a network to determine its neighbors. It then presents experiments aimed at detecting jihadi propagandists and malware distributors on social networks.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069067","Semi-supervised classification;collective classification;social networks;multi-layer networks;unbalanced data;surveillance","Social network services;Prediction algorithms;Training;Malware;Data models;Task analysis;Classification algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online)","social networks;machine learning;collective classification method;degree distribution;local structure;jihadi propagandists;malware distributors","","","","32","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In real-world networks, communities often overlap. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to detect overlapping communities in networks. Local Expansion and optimization approaches have gained popularity due to their scalability and robustness. In a method based on local expansion, the seeding strategy and scoring function employed are crucial to the performance of the algorithm.In this paper, a scoring function called CEIL score is used with ground-truth seeds in local expansion and optimization algorithm. Using CEIL score has significantly improved performance of the algorithms with respect to evaluation metrics NMI and F1 score. However, CEIL has lower coverage than conductance. An extension to CEIL score, called MCEIL score is proposed. Using MCEIL score returns communities with coverage as high as conductance, and NMI and F1 scores higher than conductance on different kinds of datasets.Experiments on datasets of different types with different seeding strategies show that the improvements in NMI and F1 score obtained by MCEIL score are substantial.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069064","","Complex networks;Optimization;Measurement;Social networking (online);Prediction algorithms;Physics","complex networks;graph theory;network theory (graphs);optimisation","scoring function;community detection;complex network analysis;local expansion;seeding strategy;ground-truth seeds;optimization algorithm;seed expansion methods;MCEIL score","","","","22","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They ignore, for instance, the curiosity level of people, which may indicate that they can be influenced to seek for information given their interest. For example, the game Pokémon GO spread rapidly because of the aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information propagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is a dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our model in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or IC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world networks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map. We present a mean-field approach that reproduces with a good accuracy the evolution of macroscopic quantities, such as the density of stiflers, for the system's behavior with the curiosity. We also obtain an analytical solution of the mean-field equations that allows to predicts a transition from a phase where the information remains confined to a small number of users to a phase where it spreads over a large fraction of the population. The results indicate that the curiosity increases the information spreading in all networks as compared with the spreading without curiosity, and that this increase is larger in spatial networks than in social networks. When the curiosity is taken into account, the maximum number of informed individuals is reached close to the transition point. Since curious people are more open to a new product, concepts, and ideas, this is an important factor to be considered in propagation modeling. Our results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between diffusion process and dynamical heterogeneous transmission in social networks.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069089","","Integrated circuit modeling;Analytical models;Social networking (online);Psychology;Games;Epidemics","social networking (online)","information spreading;information propagation;United States roads map;mean-field equations;spatial networks;social networks;social curiosity","","","","28","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Representing human factors has been elusive since decision making is driven by a host of interacting factors such as time pressure, perceived risks, and social influence. We develop two complementary data-driven models to describe decision making in natural disaster scenarios based upon the observed behavior of subjects in a controlled behavioral experiment where participants must decide whether and when to evacuate from a virtual natural disaster. We first develop a rate-based model that quantifies an individual's decision-making strategy as a function of the reported disaster threat level, which we observe to be a primary influence of collective behavior, and use this model to simulate and predict evacuation at the population level. We investigate the effect of social influence on strategy adjustments that emerge in group contexts, comparing evacuation decisions made individually with those that are arrived at via group consensus or vote. We find that the accurate characterization of group behavior mandates the consideration of individual heterogeneity, leading to a second approach using an artificial neural network which incorporates more experimental parameters, including a measure of individual variation, to predict precise evacuation times. An alternative method of quantifying individual differences in the neural network uses participants' social media data as input to the model and achieves comparable prediction accuracy.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069135","","Decision making;Protocols;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Social network services;Data models;Transportation","decision making;disasters;emergency management;human factors;neural nets;social networking (online)","collective human decision making;communication systems;transportation networks;public safety;risky situations;human factors;interacting factors;time pressure;social influence;natural disaster scenarios;controlled behavioral experiment;virtual natural disaster;rate-based model;collective behavior;group contexts;evacuation decisions;group consensus;group behavior;disaster threat level;data-driven models;action protocols;perceived risks;artificial neural network;social media data","","","","28","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We used these descriptors to associate themes and sentiment with images, and analyzed over 57,000 images related to the Paris Attacks. We discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text. We also uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user-generated textual content. Further, our analysis revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment.

We have introduced new verb semantics which cover all the categories of verbs. Based on those semantics, new verb scoring axioms are implemented. Then new set of hybrid algorithms have been formulated in terms of word, sentence and paragraph level scoring. Specially a new sentence level scoring algorithm has been developed considering adjective-verb-adverb combinations.

Similar to almost link analysis algorithms, HITS method consider all edges identically in each computation. However, we find that value of edges in real cases are not identical in analyzing and depend on the relationships/associations in content of two endings. Therefore, in HITS, edge weight should be also computed so that be suitable with value of corresponding relationship/association. Benefiting from the edge weighting, we can treat the problems of ""invaluable edges"" and their relevant nodes (normally as ""rubbishes"") in analysis. With this motivation, an improvement HITS (E-HITS) is proposed in this paper. In proposed method, we analyze the meaning of edge, corresponding relationship/association and its characteristics (especially as ""group-based"") as basis for edge-weight calculation, in which, the calculation is only based on the available hub and authority parameters on graph.

Studies predicting scientific effects in the academia are mostly based on estimating citation numbers of publications. However, there are few studies focusing on predicting the impact of scientists. Determining the potential influence of scientists is useful for future scientific studies and organizations. In this respect, we propose a new approach for predicting future impacts of scientists by considering the number of citations that each scientist individually has. A great number of studies predicting citation count of publications use content based information such as title, abstract and keywords of publication, institution of scientists, journal impact factor of publisher, etc. and they don't benefit from graph structures in citation networks. However, citations among scientific publications create more complex networks which have the potential for mining scientific impacts. So, we formulated the problem of predicting future citation counts of a given scientist, as a link prediction problem for directed, weighted and dynamic citation networks. The proposed link prediction method is able to predict links and its weights. Firstly, we introduce a dynamic metric based on increasing and decreasing trends during transitions time frames in citation networks. Then, we use the introduced dynamic proximity metric with some simple topological features in classifiers to predict citation count. Experiments are conducted on 12 sampled datasets which are extracted from two citation networks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs well when considering the problem of prediction links with its weights is firstly addressed in the context of link prediction problem in directed, weighted and dynamic networks.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069079","citation count;link prediction;directed;weighted and dynamic networks","Measurement;Mathematical model;Task analysis;Prediction methods;Social networking (online);Supervised learning;Complex networks","citation analysis;complex networks;data mining;graph theory;supervised learning","link prediction problem;directed citation networks;weighted citation networks;dynamic citation networks;link prediction method;prediction links;citation numbers;scientific publications;supervised learning;prediction citation;scientific impacts mining","","","","16","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some conventional community detection methods may have limited performance because they merely focus on topological structure of networks. In addition to topology, content information is another significant aspect of social networks. Some state-of-the-art methods started to combine these two aspects of information, but they often assume that topology and content share the same characteristics. However, for some examples of social networks, content may mismatch with topological structure. In order to better cope with such situations, we introduce a novel community detection method under the framework of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Our proposed method integrates topology and content of networks, and introduces a novel adaptive parameter for controlling the contribution of content with respect to the identified mismatch degree between the topological and content information. The case study using real social networks show that our new method can simultaneously obtain community partition and the corresponding semantic descriptions. Experiments on both artificial networks and real social networks further indicate that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting more robust behaviour when the mismatch topological and content information is observed.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069159","Social network;Community detection;Semantic description;Non-negative matrix Factorization;Robustness","Social networking (online);Topology;Network topology;Semantics;Sparse matrices;Linear programming;Adaptive systems","complex networks;matrix decomposition;social networking (online);topology","topological information;content information;artificial networks;social network analysis;community detection;adaptive community detection;non-negative matrix factorization","","","","26","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there were relevant past studies on the external environment factor of breast cancer in Taiwan, but most statistical analyses had done little interactive visualization differences between air pollution indexes of counties/cities and the general trend status of breast cancer.in this study, a cross-domain integration was conducted based on air pollution and the density of cars/motorcycles in counties/cities to present it in a data visualization manner. The aim is to explore the correlation between the exposure to external environmental factor and breast cancer incidence rate in Taiwan. This involved integrating the open government data and establishing an entity-relationship model (ERD) using Power BI to visualize it, and exploring the correlation between the exposure to external environmental factor and breast cancer incidence rate in Taiwan. Supplemented by data visualization, data drilling was done on the impact of air pollution indexes in counties/cities to breast cancer, thereby providing a more effective platform for relevant institutions and the public to perform more beneficial breast cancer prevention advocacy, raising public awareness on breast cancer, and lowering the harmfulness of external environmental factor on breast cancer in the future.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069054","Breast Cancer;Breast cancer risk;Air Pollution;Open Data;Interactive Visualization","Breast cancer;Air pollution;Data visualization;Correlation;Indexes","air pollution;automobiles;cancer;correlation methods;data visualisation;entity-relationship modelling;environmental factors;environmental science computing;medical computing;motorcycles;statistical analysis","external environmental factor;air pollution indexes;breast cancer incidence rate;beneficial breast cancer prevention advocacy;Taiwan;statistical analyses;interactive visualization;open government data;entity-relationship model;ERD;Power BI;data visualization;data drilling","","","","11","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The global crowdfunding industry estimates the fundraising volume to be up to $60 Billion in 2016, surpassing traditional forms of finance. Crowdfunding by counterparts and lending have been extensively studied but, until now, only a small amount of research was focused on donation-based platforms. In this paper, we propose a first analysis of the Leetchi donation crowdfunding platform and of an impact of social network activity on project success. The project success insights covered in this article could guide the project owners into more successful decisions and strategies on social media. We collected and analyzed the Twitter activity related to Leetchi projects from November 1st to November 30th , 2016 obtaining a set of 19,000 tweets mentioning 438 Leetchi projects. We define and investigate seven social media features: the number of tweets, number of profiles, number of influencers, audience of the top influencer, the average number of followers and friends and statuses of people mentioning the projects. We also model Leetchi social media campaigns as a diffusion graph and extend our analysis with eight additional features: the order, the size, the number of connected components, the average in/out-degrees, the weighted average in/out-degrees and the density of the diffusion graph. Finally, we study the predictive power of all 15 features on the various levels of success of Leetchi projects using machine learning algorithms. We found that while traditional social media metrics allows predicting the reach of small funding (from 1€ to 100€), social network features allow better distinguish projects with a high level of funding (from 100€ to 1,000€).","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069121","Crowdfunding;Factors of success;Social net-work analysis;Twitter campaign;Decision support","Twitter;Investment;Facebook;Crawlers;Uniform resource locators","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","Leetchi social media campaigns;Leetchi crowdfunding projects success;global crowdfunding industry;donation-based platforms;Leetchi donation crowdfunding platform;social network activity;social media metrics;diffusion graph;Twitter;machine learning","","","","16","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To find a larger sample of reports, a possible way is to mine online social media. With its current widespread use, social media such as Twitter has given rise to massive amounts of data, which can be used as reports for drug side effects. To process these large datasets, Apache Spark has become popular for fast, distributed batch processing. In this work, we have improved on previous pipelines in sentimental analysis-based mining, processing, and extracting tweets with drug-caused side effects. We have also added a new ensemble classifier using a combination of sentiment analysis features to increase the accuracy of identifying drug-caused side effects. In addition, the frequency count for the side effects is also provided. Furthermore, we have also implemented the same pipeline in Apache Spark to improve the speed of processing of tweets by 2.5 times, as well as to support the process of large tweet datasets. As the frequency count of drug side effects opens a wide door for further analysis, we present a preliminary study on this issue, including the side effects of simultaneously using two drugs, and the potential danger of using less-common combination of drugs. We believe the pipeline design and the results present in this work would have great implication on studying drug side effects and on big data analysis in general.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069059","classification;machine learning;sentiment analysis;opinion mining;Apache Spark;Twitter;natural language processing;supervised learning;adverse drug event","Drugs;Twitter;Feature extraction;Pipelines;Sentiment analysis","batch processing (computers);Big Data;cluster computing;data analysis;data mining;distributed processing;drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pharmaceutical industry;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","drug side effects;Apache Spark;social media;drug-caused side effects;mining frequency;FDA reporting systems;Twitter dataset;sentimental analysis;ensemble classifier;Big Data analysis;online social media mining;tweet minig;tweet extraction;tweet processing;pharmaceutical companies;distributed batch processing","","","","26","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have used real networks and agent based simulations with various parameters including different propagation probabilities, nodes selection strategies and number of seeds.

Our results demonstrate that there is no correlation between leadership and early movement, there is negative correlation between leadership and new directions, while leadership and new area exploration are positively correlated. Thus, as an example, in baboons, our approach shows that while leaders are not the first to move, they are typically at the front and move in a new area with everybody immediately aligning in the direction of leader.

Because of their ability to address large networks, local community detection methods that start from a seed node have become the focus of many research endeavours in recent times. In this paper, a derivative-based local community detection method, inspired by active contours, is proposed for finding a community surrounding an initial seed. The method is based on the concepts of curvature and gradient of the current communitys boundary. Curvature and gradient comprise the velocity function used to determine whether the boundary should move to include a candidate node in its vicinity. Unlike Euclidean space, networks have non-uniform space with fluctuations of dimensionality, given by the fluctuation in degrees of nodes, which complicates the calculation of derivatives used to define the curvature and gradient of boundary nodes. In this research, with some intuitive imagination, a framework for approximating derivatives in network space is proposed. Benchmarking this community detection method against three contemporary methods shows that it is capable of building communities with equal or better conductance.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069062","","Shape;Active contours;Social networking (online);Australia;Detection algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Machine vision","complex networks;graph theory;network theory (graphs)","graph space;seed node;nonuniform space;boundary nodes;network space;derivative-based local community detection","","","","20","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve this problem, we consider a method for indirectly determining a Laplacian matrix from its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. As the first step, our prior study proposed a method for estimating eigenvalues of a Laplacian matrix by using the resonance of oscillation dynamics on networks with no a priori information about the network structure, and showed the effectiveness of this method.

In this paper, we focus paper on analyzing public profiles on social networks. We make two main contributions. First, we study the interplay between the time of a post and the type of the media being shared. For example, whether the best time to share a video is different from the best time to share an image and whether the engagement with a particular type depends on the profile (for example, whether the profile belongs to a news agency or a company). Second, we provide the first in-depth analysis of user engagement on social network profiles of public figures in an Arab Country. In particular, our aim is to answer the following questions. What is the best time to post a message, to get the highest user engagement, and whether such time depends on the the type of message being shared and the social platform being used? Is user interaction behavior and patterns in an Arab country similar to previously discovered patterns?","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069074","","Twitter;Facebook;Business;Media;Data collection;Australia","human factors;social networking (online)","post time;user engagement;public profiles;social networking Web sites;organization;business perspective;user influence;social network profiles;public figures;Arab Country;Arab world;marketing;user interaction behavior","","","","15","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the major defense against Android malware is commercial mobile security products which mainly use signature-based method for detection. However, attackers can easily devise methods, such as obfuscation and repackaging, to evade the detection, which calls for new defensive techniques that are harder to evade. In this paper, resting on the analysis of Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from the smali files, we further categorize the API calls which belong to the some method in the smali code into a block. Based on the generated API call blocks, we then explore deep neural networks (i.e., Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked AutoEncoders (SAEs)) for newly unknown Android malware detection. Using a real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center, a comprehensive experimental study is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that (1) our proposed feature extraction method (i.e., using API call blocks) outperforms using API calls directly in Android malware detection; (2) DBN works better than SAEs in this application; and (3) the detection performance of deep neural networks is better than shallow learning architectures.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069130","","Malware;Smart phones;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Support vector machines;Social networking (online);Java","Android (operating system);application program interfaces;belief networks;digital signatures;feature extraction;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;source code (software)","deep neural networks;commercial mobile security products;signature-based method;API calls;feature extraction;Android malware detection;cybersecurity;application programming interface calls;deep belief network;stacked autoencoders;smali code","","","","23","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, an overall network proximity matrix is generated to capture both local and global network structural information, by aggregating different k-th order network proximities between different nodes. Then, a semi-supervised stacked auto-encoder is employed to learn the hidden representations which can best preserve the aggregated proximity in the original network, and also map the node pairs with higher proximity closer to each other in the embedding space. With the hidden representations learned by DNE-APP, we apply vector-based machine learning techniques to conduct node classification and link label prediction tasks on the real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DNE-APP model over the state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069055","Network embedding;graph representation;stacked auto-encoder;semi-supervised;network proximity","Sparse matrices;Computational modeling;Matrix decomposition;Social networking (online);Task analysis;Classification algorithms;Prediction algorithms","embedded systems;neural nets;pattern classification;social networking (online);supervised learning;vectors","semisupervised stacked autoencoder;node classification;link label prediction tasks;low-dimensional feature vector representation learning;deep network embedding model with aggregated proximity preservation;DNEAPP;vector-based machine learning","","","","13","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The size of network is increasing and the structure of network is becoming more complex. Community is a unique network structure with great research value. The task of community analysis goes through two separate phases: first, detection of meaningful community structure from a network, and second, evaluation of the appropriateness of the detected community structure. With the popularity of network research, many community detection algorithms emerged which can be grouped in categories, based on different criteria. In order to applicate community detection algorithms in real-world network analysis, we need to measure the performance of the algorithm. The performance depends on two points, that is, whether the algorithm can give the result of community division in an acceptable time, and whether the algorithm can reveal the community structure of the network with high quality. In recent years, systems used to analyze network and detect community are mushrooming. However, existing systems rarely have evaluation function, either providing social network analysis or providing data analysis service. We need a tool to evaluate community detection algorithms. In response to the challenge, the Community Evaluation System (CES) is proposed to meet the demands of community detection algorithms' evaluation. CES can evaluate community detection algorithms with multiple metrics. It uses B/S mode, integrates Spark, Yarn and HDFS technology to support the operation of large-scale data, and experiments prove that it is effective.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069066","Community detection;Community detection metric;Evaluation system;Parallel system framework","Detection algorithms;Measurement;Heuristic algorithms;Parallel algorithms;Social network services;Data mining;Task analysis","Big Data;data analysis;Internet;social networking (online)","community detection algorithms;real-world network analysis;social network analysis;data analysis;community structure;CES;community evaluation system;Big Data;Internet;HDFS technology;Spark;Yarn","","","","11","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study attempts to propose two dynamic similarity metrics for the purpose of dynamic link prediction in longitudinal networks through mining evolutionary information. These metrics consider the similarity between network structural and neighborhood changes over time incident to non-connected actor pairs. These metrics are then used as dynamic features in supervised link prediction model and performances are compared against two baseline static similarity metrics (i.e., AdamicAdar and Katz). Higher performance scores achieved by these features, examined in this study, exemplifies them as prospective candidates not only for dynamic link prediction task but also in understanding the growth pattern of dynamic networks.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069126","dynamic link prediction;longitudinal networks;dynamic similarity metrics;evolution mining","Time series analysis;Time measurement;Position measurement;Social network services;Silicon compounds;Mathematical model","data mining;evolutionary computation;supervised learning","dynamic link prediction task;dynamic networks;neighborhood evolution;network science;evolutionary network analysis;network dynamics;dynamic similarity metrics;actor-level evolution;network structure;longitudinal networks;nonconnected actor pairs;dynamic features;supervised link prediction model;baseline static similarity metrics;evolutionary information mining;actor-level structural evolution","","","","20","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of existing approaches are based on the assumption that a given network evolves following a single phenomenon, e.g. ""rich get richer"" or ""friend of my friend is my friend"". However, dynamics of network dynamic changes over time and different parts of the network evolve in different manner. Because of that, we hypothesise that the prediction accuracy can be improved by providing different treatment to different nodes and links. Building on that assumption, we propose a Community Bridge Boosting Prediction Model (CBBPM) that treats certain bridge nodes differently depending on their structural position. For such bridge nodes their similarity score obtained using traditional link-based prediction methods is boosted. By doing so the importance of these nodes is increased and at the same time ensuring that the CBBPM can be used with any existing link prediction method. Our experimental results show that such bridge node similarity boosting mechanism can improve the accuracy of traditional link prediction methods.","2473-991X","978-1-4503-4993-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069133","Link Prediction;Community Bridge Boosting Prediction Model;Social Networks","Bridges;Predictive models;Social networking (online);Training;Boosting;Electronic mail","complex networks;network theory (graphs);social networking (online)","bridge node similarity boosting mechanism;CBBPM;community bridge boosting social network link prediction model","","","","19","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Zhang",NA,"LTE Optimization Engineering Handbook","","2017","","","383","433","Circuit switched fallback (CSFB) addresses the requirements of the first phase of the evolution of mobile voice services, which began on a commercial scale in 2011. CSFB is the solution to the reality of mixed networks today and throughout the transition to ubiquitous all‐LTE networks in the future phases of LTE voice evolution. Usually, the operator may deploy LTE with 3GPP CSFB solution across LTE coverage area. In CSFB, whenever an LTE handset generates or receives a voice call it is automatically transferred to the 2G/3G networks. The key point from CSFB view is the SGs interface between MSC and mobility management entity (MME) that SGs interface connects the MSC/VLR and the serving GPRS support node and MME (SGSN‐MME). This interface is used for registration in the MSC/VLR of the UE by performing combined procedures, to page the UE on behalf of the MSC/VLR and to convey CS‐related services.","","9781119159001","10.1002/9781119158981.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9004596.pdf&bkn=8371474&pdfType=chapter","","Long Term Evolution;Optimization;Handover;Switching circuits;IP networks;Telephony","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"
"LTE Optimization Principle and Method","X. Zhang",NA,"LTE Optimization Engineering Handbook","","2017","","","24","121","The optimization of long‐term evolution (LTE) network mainly refers to the pre‐optimization and the continuous optimization before and after the network launched. Network optimization results and the level of network optimization work, directly related to the future performance of the network stability and capacity. When doing optimization, the following performance must be considered. These are coverage, interference, mobility, capacity, and quality. LTE optimization can be divided into two steps, one is radio access network (RAN) pre‐launch optimization, the other is post launch optimization. RAN pre‐launch optimization for LTE assists in the evaluation and tuning of the RAN in order to ensure that the performance and coverage of the RAN is maximized prior to commercial launch. Upon completion of the pre‐launch optimization phase, the acceptance phase will be performed. The post‐launch optimization is carried out on counter level, parameter level, cell level, and terrain/area level.","","9781119159001","10.1002/9781119158981.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9004638.pdf&bkn=8371474&pdfType=chapter","","Optimization;Long Term Evolution;Interference;Handover;Key performance indicator;Planning","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

The chapter then discusses semi‐persistent scheduling (SPS) and other scheduling methods. It also discusses PRB and MCS selection mechanism. The chapter focuses on VoLTE capacity, VoLTE coverage, VoLTE delay, intra‐LTE handover, enhanced SRVCC (eSRVCC), network quality, subjective speech quality and VoLTE optimization. For optimization, data capturing of VoLTE is necessary. The main idea of eSRVCC is to anchor the media (user plane) in one point in network.

Smartphone experience includes response time, always on friendly, and battery life, and so on, which cause challenges to existing LTE networks. The key to good smartphone experience is that UE should maintain active RRC connection; the number of RRC connected users supported by eNB is an important metric for estimating whether eNB is smartphone‐enabled.

The long‐term evolution (LTE) mobility can be divided into “intra‐LTE mobility” and “inter‐LTE mobility”. It can be further divided into RRC_connected and RRC_idle mode mobility. When the UE is powered on, before RRC, it says that the UE is in idle mode. When the UE is in idle mode, it uses reselection for its mobility. In idle mode mobility it is largely controlled by the UE (based on broadcast parameters) and so the exact behavior may vary somewhat between UE models. Intra‐LTE handover feature manages the UE in connected mode and allows for seamless mobility from one LTE cell to another. In contrast to idle mode, connected mode mobility is entirely managed by the LTE RAN based on configured and received measurement reports from the UE. Only hard handover is supported in LTE.","","9781119159001","10.1002/9781119158981.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9005024.pdf&bkn=8371474&pdfType=chapter","","Handover;Long Term Evolution;Frequency measurement;Battery charge measurement;Optimization;Multiaccess communication","","","","","","","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

The interference in an LTE system comes from the surrounding cells, called inter‐cell interference. Reduce neighbor cell interference is the key method to improve DL SINR.

One possible way to leverage big data analysis is predictive resource allocation, which has been reported to increase spectrum and energy resource utilization efficiency with the predicted user behavior including user mobility. However, few works address how the traffic load prediction can be exploited to optimize the data-driven radio access. We show how to translate the predicted traffic load into the essential information used for resource optimization by taking energy-saving transmission for non-real-time user as an example. By formulating and solving an energy minimizing resource allocation problem with future instantaneous bandwidth information, we not only provide a performance upper bound, but also reveal that only two key parameters are related to the future information. By exploiting the residual bandwidth probability derived from the traffic volume prediction, the two parameters can be estimated accurately when the transmission delay allowed by the user is large, and the closed-form solution of global optimal resource allocation can be obtained when the delay approaches infinity. We provide a heuristic resource allocation policy to guarantee a target transmission completion probability when the delay is no-so-large. Simulation results validate our analysis, show remarkable energy-saving gain of the proposed predictive policy over non-predictive policies, and illustrate that the time granularity in predicting traffic load should be identical to the delay allowed by the user.","2509-3312","","10.1007/s41650-017-0005-y","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932165","predictive resource allocation;big data;traffic load;energy saving","Resource management;Bandwidth;Big Data;Delays;Wireless networks;Upper bound","","","","5","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

In this paper, we use the network structure, which is adaptable for the big data traffic, to improve the security of wireless networks. Specifically, a big-data aided hybrid relay selection scheme is designed and analyzed to enhance physical layer security. First, considering the ideal situation that an eavesdropper's CSI (Channel State Information) is known to the legal nodes, we propose an optimal hybrid relay selection scheme consisting of the optimal mode selection scheme and the optimal relay selection scheme. In this case, we analyze the upper bound of an eavesdropper's capacity in FD (Full-Duplex) mode and the secrecy outage probabilities of the optimal HD (Half-Duplex), FD, and hybrid relay selection schemes. Through the analysis of data, it is clear that the mode selection is decided by the self-interference of the FD technique. However, the instantaneous CSI of an eavesdropper is difficult to obtain due to the passive characteristic of eavesdroppers in practice. Therefore, a more practical hybrid relay selection scheme with only the channel distribution information of an eavesdropper is further studied, where a weighting factor is employed to guarantee that the hybrid mode is no worse than either the FD mode or HD mode when the self-interference grows. Finally, the simulation results show the improved security of our proposed scheme.","2509-3312","","10.1007/s41650-017-0008-8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932168","Big data;hybrid relay selection;secrecy outage probability;eavesdropper;physical layer security","Relays;Security;Interference cancellation;Wireless communication;Physical layer security;Manganese;Upper bound","","","","3","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

The performance of new advanced models and technologies heavily depends on the accuracy of the wireless CSI (Channel State Information). This study examined the randomness of the wireless channel parameters based on the characteristics of the radio propagation environment. The diversity of the statistical properties of wireless channel parameters inspired us to introduce the concept of the tomographic channel model. With this model, the static part of the CSI can be extracted from the huge amount of existing CSI data of previous measurements, which can be defined as the wireless channel feature. In the proposed scheme for obtaining CSI with the tomographic channel model, the GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) is applied to acquire the distribution of the wireless channel parameters, and the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is applied to automatically distinguish different wireless channels. The wireless channel feature information can be stored offline to guide the design of pilot symbols and save pilot resources. The numerical results based on actual measurements demonstrated the clear diversity of the statistical properties of wireless channel parameters and that the proposed scheme can extract the wireless channel feature automatically with fewer pilot resources.

From our extensive literature review, we identify that there is no strict placement rule that best fits every network in SDN. Dynamic addition and deletion of controllers is inevitable. Motivated from this, in this paper, we attempt to transform the CPP into a CSP. We show that, in the dynamic SDN environment, researchers need to pay attention to CSP issues. The clear advantage of CSP over CPP is that, in the dynamic SDN ecosystem, we can answer fundamental questions about the control plane performance, i.e., minimum number of controllers, their workload distribution, and placement/locations.

Unfortunately, the channel reciprocity is often jeopardized by the non-symmetric transceiver RF (Radio Frequency) circuits at both sides of the link. By excluding UEs from the calibration procedure, the TLS (Total Least Squares) method is extended to the case of partial calibration, where only the APs are involved to exchange calibration signals to compensate for RF mismatches. Nevertheless, channel fluctuations between APs significantly degrade system performance. Therefore, we propose a scheme to obtain the diversity gain, by performing a calibration with the combination of the calibration signals of different channel coherent times.

The new algorithm uses a tuple containing the number of files and the total file size as the QoS measure for the requested task. The master node sets a threshold for the requested task based on the QoS to filter storage nodes that meet the requirements of the task. In order to guarantee the reliability of the new algorithm, we consider the impact of CPU utilization, memory usage, disk IO occupancy rate, network bandwidth usage and hard disk usage on load balancing performance when calculating the real-time load balancing of storage nodes. The heterogeneity of the network is considered when the master node schedule task assignments to ensure the fairness of the algorithm. The comprehensive evaluation value is determined based the performance load ratio, which is calculated from the real-time load value of the storage node and a performance value after normalization. The master node assigns tasks to the storage node with the highest comprehensive evaluation value. The storage nodes provide adaptive feedback based on changes in the degree of connectivity, rather than periodic update of the load information. The actual distributed file system environment is set up on the server cluster, the performance of the new algorithm is tested through a contrast experiment.

Previously, storage and processing of data were simple tasks; however, it is now one of the biggest challenges in the industry. Experts are paying close attention to big data. Designing a system capable of storing and analyzing such data in order to extract meaningful information for decision-making is a priority. The Apache Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases are some of the core technologies that are being used to solve these issues. This paper contributes to the solutions to the issues of big data storage and processing. It presents an analysis of the current technologies in the industry that could be useful in this context.

Two elements are introduced to extend the RoF approach. First, the carrier frequency is raised into the W-band (75–110 GHz) to increase the available capacity. Second, a mechanical beam-steering solution based on a Stewart platform is adopted for the transmitter antenna to allow it to follow a moving receiver along a known path, thereby enhancing the coverage area. The performance of a system transmitting a 2.5 Gbit/s non-return-to-zero signal generated by photonic up-conversion over a wireless link is evaluated in terms of real-time BER (Bit Error Rate) measurements.

However, an inevitable barrier to the widespread deployment of spatial crowdsourcing applications in vehicular networks is the concern of privacy. Hence, We propose a novel privacy-friendly spatial crowdsourcing scheme. Unlike the existing schemes, the proposed scheme considers the privacy issue from a new perspective according that the spatial-temporal tasks can be linked and analyzed to break the location privacy of workers.

These devices can be static or quasi-static (e.g., laptops or IoT devices); however, it is becoming clear that the preponderance of wireless data consumption is dominated by handheld mobile devices which will exhibit varying physical orientations and 3D dynamics. Because free-space optical and visible light communications are primarily line of sight, transmitter radiation patterns and receiver field of view are very important for predicting the data performance. Given dynamic emission characteristics, there is an opportunity to adapt to the receiver. The caveat of dynamic VLC systems is that the quality and distribution of the resulting illumination must be considered as part of the dual goal of providing high quality lighting. In this paper we investigate the impact of device orientation and mobility on static and then dynamic lighting emission under a multi-cell lighting model. From a source standpoint we consider the performance of beam control through angular control and beam focus for one or more sources in a lighting array. Analysis and simulation demonstrate that dynamic beam and luminaire control can increase the AP coverage range by 12.8X under a 1.67 m ceiling height. Furthermore, the use of multiple sources tracking device orientation and position can mitigate off-angle performance degradation by increasing redundancy in the number of available connections. Our proposed techniques, when applied in concert, successfully mitigate common concerns about the viability of VLC and indoor FSO (Free Space Optical Communication) methods related to signal occlusion and device dynamics.","2509-3312","","10.1007/s41650-017-0041-7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932284","VLC;ultra-dense wireless networks;beam steering;MEMS;dynamic wireless networks","Lighting;Receivers;Optical transmitters;Wireless networks;Visible light communication;Beam steering;Reliability","","","","16","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

In addition, forced oscillations may have a negative impact on the estimation of mode and mode-shape if they are not properly accounted for. To improve the power system reliability and dynamic properties, it is important to first distinguish forced oscillations from free oscillations and then locate the sources of forced oscillations in a timely manner.

Demand response (DR) is expected to be an effective means for accommodating the integration of renewable energy generations and mitigating their power output fluctuations. Despite their potential contributions to power system secure and economic operation, uncoordinated operations of these flexible resources may result in unexpected congestions in the distribution system concerned. In addition, the behaviors and impacts of flexible resources are normally highly uncertain and complex in deregulated electricity market environments. In this context, this paper aims to propose a DR based congestion management strategy for smart distribution systems. The general framework and procedures for distribution congestion management is first presented. A bi-level optimization model for the day-ahead congestion management based on the proposed framework is established. Subsequently, the robust optimization approach is introduced to alleviate negative impacts introduced by the uncertainties of DG power outputs and market prices. The economic efficiency and robustness of the proposed congestion management strategy is demonstrated by an actual 0.4 kV distribution system in Denmark.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0257-9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8982204","Distribution system;Congestion management;Demand response;Load aggregators;Uncertainty;Robust optimization;Bi-level linear programming","Uncertainty;Load modeling;Power systems;Economics;Optimization;Load management;Electricity supply industry","","","","10","","32","","4 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Considering that microgrids in a MGC, power dispatch optimization in a MGC is difficult to achieve. In this paper, a hybrid interactive communication optimization solution (HICOS) is suggested based on flexible communication, which could be used to solve plug-in or plug-out operation states of microgrids in MGC power dispatch optimization. HICOS consists of a hierarchical architecture: the upper layer uses distributed control among multiple microgrids, with no central controller for the MGC, and the lower layer uses a central controller for each microgrid. Based on flexible communication links among microgrids, the optimal iterative information are exchanged among microgrids, thus HICOS would gradually converge to the global optimal solution. While some microgrids plug-in or plug-out, communication links will be changed, so as to unsuccessfully reach optimal solution. Differing from changeless communication links in traditional communication networks, HICOS redefines the topology of flexible communication links to meet the requirement to reach the global optimal solutions. Simulation studies show that HICOS could effectively reach the global optimal dispatch solution with non-MGC center. Especially, facing to microgrids plug-in or plug-out states, HICOS would also reach the global optimal solution based on refined communication link topology.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0235-2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946851","Microgrid Cluster (MGC);Plug-in/plug-out dispatch optimization;hybrid interactive communication optimization solution(HICOS);Flexible communication","Microgrids;Optimization;Plugs;Decentralized control;Mathematical model;Generators;Hybrid power systems","","","","6","","23","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Most of current models are built using the parametric density estimation (PDE) methods, which usually assume that the wind speed are subordinate to a certain known distribution (e.g. Weibull distribution and Normal distribution) and estimate the parameters of models with the historical data. This paper presents a kernel density estimation (KDE) method which is a nonparametric way to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of wind speed. The method is a kind of data-driven approach without making any assumption on the form of the underlying wind speed distribution, and capable of uncovering the statistical information hidden in the historical data. The proposed method is compared with three parametric models using wind data from six sites. The results indicate that the KDE outperforms the PDE in terms of accuracy and flexibility in describing the long-term wind speed distributions for all sites. A sensitivity analysis with respect to kernel functions is presented and Gauss kernel function is proved to be the best one.

In this paper, it is found that the instability of WTSs applying the inertia compensation scheme, characterized by the oscillation of compensation torque, is caused by the one-step time delay produced in the acceleration observation. Hence, a linear discrete model of WTS considering the time delay of acceleration observation is developed and its stability is analyzed. Moreover, in order to stably simulate WTs with large inertia, an improved inertia compensation scheme, applying a first-order digital filter to mitigate deviation response induced by the time delay, is proposed. And, the criterion for selecting the filter coefficients is established based on the stability condition analysis.

Especially in China, the AC load has accounted for over 30% of the maximum load in many cities during summer. This paper proposes a scheme of constructing a virtual peaking unit (VPU) by public buildings' cool storage central AC (CSCAC) systems and non-CSCAC (NCSCAC) systems for the day-ahead power network dispatching (DAPND). Considering the accumulation effect of different meteorological parameters, a short term load forecasting method of public building's central AC (CAC) baseline load is firstly discussed. Then, a second-order equivalent thermal parameters model is established for the public building's CAC load. Moreover, the novel load reduction control strategies for the public building's CSCAC system and the public building's NCSCAC system are respectively presented. Furthermore, based on the multiple-rank control strategy, the model of the DAPND with the participation of a VPU is set up. The VPU is composed of large-scale regulated public building's CAC loads. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, results of a sample study on a region in Nanjing which involves 22 public buildings' CAC loads are described in this paper. Simulated results show that, by adopting the proposed DAPND scheme, the power network peak load in the region obviously decreases with a small enough deviation between the regulated load value and the dispatching instruction of the VPU. The total electricity-saving amount accounts for 7.78% of total electricity consumption of the VPU before regulation.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0264-x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946845","Central air conditioning;Peak load shedding;Day-ahead power network dispatching;Virtual peaking unit;Schedulable capacity","Buildings;Load modeling;Cooling;Heat transfer;Graphics processing units;Thermal loading;Humidity","","","","2","","35","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

This paper discusses current development status and potential application of PtG plants in the future interconnected multi-energy systems, and further analyzes the costs and benefits of PtG plants in different application scenarios. In general, the PtG plants are not economical efficient based on current technologies and costs. But the situation is likely to change with the development of PtG technologies and interconnected operation of gas-electricity energy system.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0285-0","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946825","Power to gas;Energy storage;Power system economics;Electricity market;Renewable energy;Multi-energy system","Power systems;Electric potential;Economics;Raw materials;Carbon dioxide;Electrochemical processes;Investment","","","","11","","36","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Secondly, security constraints including the permissible voltage range, the line loading limits and the UPFC ratings are considered. System security enhancement with the least increase in line loss is tackled by solving a much reduced optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The computational task of the OPF problem is reduced by deducing the security-constrained line loss minimum conditions and removing the equality constraints. Thirdly, a hybrid control scheme is proposed.

However, the power grid in a distribution system is non-ideal, presenting itself as a voltage source with significant impedance. This means that an inverter using an LCL filter may interact with other grid-connected inverters via the nonideal grid. In this paper, damping optimization of LCL filters to reduce this interaction is studied for a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI). Simulation results show that resonant oscillation occurs in a distributed power grid, even if the VSI with an LCL filter is well designed for standalone applications. A small-signal analysis is performed to predict this stability problem and to locate the boundary of the instability using an impedance approach. Based on these analytical results, optimized damping of the LCL filter can be designed. The oscillation phenomena and optimized damping design are verified by simulations and experimental measurements.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0298-8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940961","LCL filter;Three-phase voltage source inverter;Non-ideal power grid;Optimized design;Interacting converters","Damping;Inverters;Power grids;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Resistors;Impedance","","","","2","","24","","24 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Specially, a critical value of the CCF active damping coefficient $k_{\mathrm{damp}-\mathrm{c}}$ is proposed to define three distinct regions of stability evaluation. If $k_{\mathrm{damp}-\mathrm{c}} > 0$, a sufficient but smaller damping coefficient $(k_{\mathrm{damp}} < k_{\mathrm{damp}_{-}\mathrm{c}})$ is recommended as optimum damping solution; if $k_{\mathrm{damp}_{-}\mathrm{c}}=0$, system will be unstable irrespective of active damping; and if $k_{\mathrm{damp}_{-}\mathrm{c}} < 0$, active damping is not necessary to design a stable system. Necessary conditions to ensure stability are identified; guidelines for controller design are then presented to optimize the performance of active damping and dynamic response.

Furthermore, the switch voltage stress is halved because of the series connection of half bridge modules. The PWM plus phase-shift control strategy is employed, where the duty cycle is adopted to regulate the voltages between the input and output sides and the phase-shift angle is applied to achieve the power flow regulation.

However, most protection algorithms up to now have been designed based on extensive time domain simulations using one specific test system. Therefore, general applicability or adaptability to different configurations and system changes is not by default ensured, and it is difficult to gain in-depth understanding of the influencing parameters through time domain simulations. In order to analyse the first travelling wave for meshed HVDC grids, voltage and current wave transfer functions with respect to the incident voltage wave are derived adopting Laplace domain based component models. The step responses obtained from the voltage transfer functions are validated by comparison against simulations using a detailed model implemented in PSCADTM. Then, the influences of system parameters such as the number of parallel branches, HVDC grid configurations and groundings on the first travelling wave are investigated by analysing the voltage and current transfer functions.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0307-y","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940967","HVDC grids;DC grid protection;Travelling wave;Frequency domain analysis;Transfer function","Circuit faults;HVDC transmission;Power cables;Impedance;Frequency-domain analysis;Transfer functions;Grounding","","","","14","","22","","24 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

This paper presents a modeling and optimization approach to the operational planning of electric power and natural gas systems, taking into account different energy storage facilities, such as water reservoirs, natural gas storages and line packs of pipelines. The proposed model takes advantage of captures both energy systems synergy and their associated networks. This approach identifies the interactions between the energy storage facilities and their economic impact over their optimal scheduling. The results show the benefits of an integrated operational planning of electric power and natural gas systems, the close interdependency between the energy resources stored in both systems, and the effects of a combined scheduling.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0282-3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940950","Energy storage;Hydrothermal scheduling;Integrated operational planning;Integrated energy systems;Natural gas","Natural gas;Power systems;Planning;Energy storage;Optimization;Production","","","","11","","39","","24 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

The uncertainties of one system will not only threaten its own safe operation but also be likely to have a significant impact on the other. Therefore, it is necessary to study the variation of state variables when random fluctuations emerge in the coupled system. In this paper, a multi-slack-bus model is proposed to calculate the power and gas flow in the coupled system. A unified probabilistic power and gas flow calculation, in which the cumulant method and Gram-Charlier expansion are applied, is first presented to obtain the distribution of state variables after considering the effects of uncertain factors. When the variation range of random factors is too large, a new method of piecewise linearization is put forward to achieve a better fitting precision of probability distribution. Compared to the Monte Carlo method, the proposed method can reduce computation time greatly while reaching a satisfactory accuracy.

Current industrial practice in optimal power flow for electric power systems has not taken the security constraints of gas systems into consideration, resulting in an overly-optimistic solution. Meanwhile, the operation of electric power and natural gas systems is coupled over multiple periods because of the ramp rate limits of power generators and the slow dynamical characteristics of gas systems. Based on these motivations, we propose a multi-period integrated natural gas and electric power system probabilistic optimal power flow (M-GEPOPF) model, which includes dynamic gas flow models. To address the uncertainties originating from wind power and load forecasting, a probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) calculation based on a three-point estimate method (3PEM) is adopted. Moreover, power-to-gas (PtG) units are employed to avoid wind power curtailment and enable flexible bi-directional energy flows between the coupled energy systems. An integrated IEEE RTS 24-bus electric power system and the Belgian 20-node natural gas system are employed as a test case to verify the applicability of the proposed M-GEPOPF model, and to demonstrate the potential economic benefits of PtG units.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0276-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940951","Natural gas and electric power system;Network interdependency;Optimal power flow;Uncertainty;Power-to-gas unit","Natural gas;Power systems;Wind power generation;Load modeling;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Economics","","","","16","","28","","24 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

In order to provide more available test cases, a new random graph generation algorithm, named “dual-stage constructed random graph” algorithm, is proposed to effectively model the power grid topology. The algorithm generates a spanning tree to guarantee the connectivity of random graphs and is capable of controlling the number of lines precisely. No matter how much the average degree is, whether sparse or not, random graphs can be quickly formed to satisfy the requirements. An approach is developed to generate random graphs with prescribed numbers of connected components, in order to simulate the power grid topology under fault conditions.

However, areas rich in wind power resources are often far away from loads centers, which leads to weak connection between wind turbines and power grid. When a grid fault occurs, new transient characteristics in weak grid integrated with doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) may present, such as voltage phase angle jump. Current control strategies for wind turbine with strong grid connection are hard to be adapted under weak gird connection. This paper explores the transient characteristics of DFIGs under voltage phase angle jump through analyzing the operation and control characteristics of DFIGs connected into weak grid when the voltage phase angle jumps. Fault ride through (FRT) control strategy of DFIGs based on adaptive phase-locked loop is proposed to adapt weak grid condition. The reference frame of the proposed strategy will be changed in real-time to track the operation condition of DFIGs according to the terminal voltage, and different phase tracking method is adopted during the grid fault. Field data analysis and time domain simulation are carried out. The results show that voltage phase angle jumps when a grid fault occurs, which weakens the FRT capability of DFIGs, and the proposed FRT control strategy can optimize transient characteristics of DFIGs, and improve the FRT capability of DFIGs.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0251-2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940974","DFIGs;Voltage phase angle jump;Transient characteristics;Adaptive FRT control strategy","Doubly fed induction generators;Transient analysis;Circuit faults;Rotors;Voltage control;Wind turbines","","","","5","","26","","24 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

To this end, we start with our prior result, a simple and analytical congestion price equation, which can be applied to any single line congestion scenario. This equation can be extended to better understand the degree to which the LMP at any bus changes due to any line status error. Furthermore, it enables a rigorous analysis of the relationship between the change in LMP at any bus with respect to any line error and various physical/economical grid conditions such as the bidding prices for marginal generators and the locations of the congested/erroneous lines.

We propose an efficient algorithm for ART-UTC to determine the green priority of different rights-of-way at each intersection. The proposed algorithm takes into account the queue length on each link, the waiting time of the first vehicle in the queue, and the incoming traffic flow to the link. We also propose a law to determine the green times of each traffic light based on the queue length on the link that is controlled by that traffic light. An advantage of ART-UTC is that due to the simple computations involved, it can be used for real-time urban traffic control. To evaluate ART-UTC, two different urban traffic networks are simulated within the urban traffic simulator SUMO. The performance of ART-UTC is compared to the performance of a fixed-time traffic controller based on Webster's formulas and a vehicle-actuated traffic controller. The results show that by using ART-UTC, the total travel time of the vehicles, the average queue length on the links in urban traffic networks, and the average waiting time of the first vehicles in the queues on the links of the traffic networks are reduced significantly in the majority of the cases compared with the fixed-time and the vehicle-actuated controllers.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317813","","Optimization;Real-time systems;Air pollution;Conferences;Roads;Adaptive systems","queueing theory;road traffic control","Webster formula;ART-UTC strategy;adaptive realtime urban traffic control;urban traffic simulator SUMO;urban traffic networks;traffic light;queue length;signal control strategy;vehicle-actuated controllers;vehicle-actuated traffic controller;fixed-time traffic controller","","","","15","IEEE","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Difficulty with facial expression recognition system is to implement generic model. Same facial expression may vary across humans, even this is true for the same person when the expression is displayed in different situations. This paper proposed the local image descriptor that extracts the histogram of second order gradients (HSOG), which capture the local curvatures of differential geometry. The shape index is computed from the curvatures and its different values correspond to different shapes. In case of facial expression recognition using full face images, if any portion of the face image is distorted, it may reflect on the recognition performance. Humans have the capability to recognize faces even by looking at some parts of the face. An attempt has been made to replicate the same on machines by only considering some of the informative regions of the face like eyes, nose, lip and forehead. Facial expression recognition experiments have been performed on some benchmark databases, Better recognition rates were achieved compared to other existing approaches.","","978-1-5386-2241-4","10.1109/ICAPR.2017.8592988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8592988","HOG;HSOG;NN;SVM;Facial Expression Recognition","Face recognition;Face;Histograms;Shape;Image recognition;Indexes","differential geometry;face recognition;feature extraction;gradient methods;human computer interaction","recognition rates;automatic facial expression recognition;human computer interaction;facial expression recognition system;local image descriptor;face image;recognition performance;facial expression recognition experiments;HSOG;HCI;histogram of second order gradient extraction;benchmark databases;behaviour analysis;differential geometry local curvature","","1","","19","IEEE","24 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the proposed approach reduces loop gain of the closed loop formed, thereby reducing delay sensitivity to process variations. In particular, standard keeper circuit is modified and new keeper circuit is proposed with reduced loop gain which results in reduction of delay variations while keeping the same noise margin and area. Other performance parameters like delay, power and Power Delay Product (PDP) of proposed keeper are also compared with other circuits.

New requirements, such as maximum latency, are becoming de facto indicators to measure network quality, complementing the classical requisites of fault tolerance to increase network availability. However, finding fault-tolerant designs that also limit the end-to-end latency of IP flows is challenging in multilayer IP-over-WDM networks, since traffic routed over IP links depends on the actual sequences of the traversed fibers and how they change in each failure state. Despite its practical importance, the research on joint optimization of end-to-end latencies and fault tolerance in multilayer optical networks is minimal. In this context, this paper presents a planning algorithm for multilayer IP-over- WDM (with OSPF-ECMP routing in the IP layer), considering both survivability and end-to-end latency awareness. Three versions of the algorithm are provided, assuming three different recovery mechanisms in the optical layer: 1 + 1 lightpath protection, unprotected lightpaths, and lightpath restoration. In all cases, as is customary, the optical layer is assumed to react first to the failures, and after that, the IP/OSPF layer adapts to the surviving topology. The aim of our algorithm is to design minimum cost networks that guarantee not only 100% survivability under some representative failure states, but also the maximum end-to-end latency for IP flows in the case of any failures. According to our results, a careful and holistic design may achieve both objectives simultaneously, without, in most cases, noticeable side effects in terms of cost and/or throughput. In its turn, we see that, when end-to-end latencies are not considered, designs tend to produce very high latencies in some flows and failure states.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.9.000B53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899262","ECMP;IP-over-WDM;Latency awareness;Multilayer network design;Net2Plan;OSPF;Traffic survivability","IP networks;Nonhomogeneous media;Routing;Optical fiber networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Adaptive optics","","","","","","","","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose novel indices extracted from the background images, displayed on an LCD screen, and we compare them with those proposed in literature designing a specific user test. We collected the legibility user ratings by displaying white text over 13 industrial background images to 19 subjects using an optical see-through head-worn display. We found that most of the proposed indices have a significant correlation with user ratings. The main result of this work is that some of the novel indices proposed had a better correlation than those used before in the literature to predict legibility.

By definition, the experience of mixed reality relies on the perceptually successful blending of reality and virtuality. Any MR system has to provide a sensory, in particular visually coherent, set of stimuli. Therefore, issues with visual coherence, that is, a discontinued experience of a MR environment, must be avoided. While it is very easy for a user to detect issues with visual coherence, it is very difficult to design and implement a system for coherence. This article presents a framework and exemplary implementation of a systematic enquiry into issues with visual coherence and possible solutions to address those issues. The focus is set on head-mounted display-based systems, notwithstanding its applicability to other types of MR systems.

To achieve this, we propose a method in which patterns consisting of randomly distributed dots are overlaid onto the real surface prior to the rendering of a virtual object behind the real surface using stereoscopic disparity. It was hypothesized that, even though the virtual object is occluding the real object’s surface, the addition of the random dot patterns should increase the strength of the binocular disparity cue, resulting in improved performance in localizing the virtual object behind the surface. In Phase I of the experiment reported here, the feasibility of the display principle was confirmed, and concurrently the effects of relative dot size and dot density on the presence and sensitivity of any perceptual bias in localizing the virtual object within the vicinity of a flat, real surface with a periodic texture were assessed. In Phase II, the effect of relative dot size and dot density on perceiving the impression of transparency of the same real surface while preserving detection of surface information was investigated. Results revealed an advantage of the proposed method in comparison with the “No Pattern” condition for the transparency ratings. Surface information preservation was also shown to decrease with increasing dot density and relative dot size.","1054-7460","","10.1162/PRES_a_00286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8071209","","Observers;Surface texture;X-ray imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Stereo image processing;Reactive power;Rendering (computer graphics)","","","","5","","","Traditional","30 Sep 2019","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

We review existing manipulation techniques and introduce a formal description of the main mappings under a common notation. Based on this notation, we analyze these mappings and their properties in order to answer crucial usability questions.

In order to predict whether the real user is approaching a virtual agent to have a face-to-face interaction or not, we describe a model of approach behavior for virtual agents. We present a novel interaction velocity prediction (IVP) algorithm that is combined with human body motion synthesis constraints and facial actions to improve the behavioral realism of virtual agents. We combine these techniques with full-body virtual crowd simulation and evaluate their benefits by conducting a user study using Oculus HMD in an immersive environment.

Through simulations, we compare the performance of improved algorithm with other localization schemes and show that improved algorithm has more efficient and stable performance.","","978-1-5386-1618-5","10.1109/ICNISC.2017.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8842737","wireless sensor networks;DV-Hop;TDOA quantization;hop-weighted","Quantization (signal);Wireless sensor networks;Distance measurement;Meters;Limiting;Wireless communication;RF signals","quantisation (signal);sensor placement;time-of-arrival estimation;wireless sensor networks","improved DV-Hop localization algorithm;wireless sensor network;TDOA quantization;hop distance;localization schemes;time difference of arrival quantization;anchor node;hop propagation","","1","","13","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The handover model of LEO satellite networks is built and the performance of MIPv6 and FMIPv6 is analyzed and in terms of handover latency, packet loss and forwarding cost. The numerical results indicate that FMIPv6 outperforms MIPv6 in terms of handover latency and packet loss by employing handover prediction and forwarding mechanisms, but FMIPv6 will cause the forwarding cost.

To reduce the environmental impacts of transport pollution and purse sustainable developments of society, many cites in China have adopted transport policies that primarily aim to reduction in ownership and usage of motor vehicles and promote use of public transport. The primary solution should be the development of mass public transit systems, e.g. public bike rental systems. Public bike rental systems have received increasing attention in recent years with initiatives to increase public transport usage and lessen the environmental impacts. However, most of the universities in China are located in the suburbs. The limited coverage of public bike rental systems and transportation network offers college students limited access to public transit systems. We design an efficient mobile system for bike sharing on campus, with the aim of improving travel conditions for students at institutions of higher education. The bike sharing system includes two parts, i.e. client and server. Client is designed based on Android system and server is designed based on Openstack cloud computing system. The bike sharing system can bring information of bike sharing and entertainment together from diverse sources on campus in a uniform way. The bike sharing system provides a consistent look and feel with access control and procedures for multiple applications and databases of bike sharing and entertainment. We divide the bike sharing system into five functional modules, i.e. login module, lessor module, lessee module and administrator module.

However, one issue that can't be ignored is that security needs to be analyzed before the cloud platform deployment. The current consensus is that security of cloud is the biggest obstacle to its development. Current cloud security issues are mainly concentrated in the theoretical stage, manifested in what cloud platform should have to ensure security; each cloud platform has its own implementation, and does not disclose its security implementation mechanisms.

In this paper, we present OFMON - an adaptive flow measurement framework to reduce the overhead and improve the accuracy. It utilizes the Packet-In and Flow-Removed messages as a passive method and uses an adaptive polling algorithm based on fuzzy logic as an active method to obtain traffic metrics. The adaptive techniques are significantly more flexible in their ability of dynamically adjusting the interval of polling depending on the fluctuations of flow, which find a balance between accuracy and overhead. The experiments illustrate that OFMON provides a better method to monitor the link utilization with higher accuracy and lower overhead.","","978-1-5386-1618-5","10.1109/ICNISC.2017.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8842781","Measurement;OpenFlow;Fuzzy logic;Software-defined network(SDN);Network Adaptive Monitoring","Monitoring;Control systems;Fuzzy logic;Reactive power;Fuzzy sets;Adaptive systems;Computers","fuzzy logic;software defined networking;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic","OFMON;SDN;software-defined networking;self-tuning networks;network conditions;network status;huge overheads;adaptive flow measurement framework;passive method;adaptive polling algorithm;fuzzy logic;traffic metrics;adaptive techniques;lower overhead;flow-removed messages;monitoring mechanisms","","1","","13","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is extremely time consuming in the SIFT matching due to the use of Euclidean distance measure. Recently, several binary SIFT (BSIFT) methods have been developed to improve the matching efficiency, whereas merely image brightness information is involved in these algorithms. The matching performance will drop because of the lack of the color information of the image. This paper presents a binary SIFT matching method combined with the color and exposure information. First, three components, including luminance, color offset and exposure offset are combined together to express the image pixel. Then, 128-D SIFT descriptor is converted into 256-bit binarized SIFT descriptor. Finally, the improved Hamming distance is proposed in the matching procedure. Experimental results on UKBench dataset show that the proposed method not only ensures the matching speed, but also improves matching accuracy.","","978-1-5386-1618-5","10.1109/ICNISC.2017.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8842716","image matching;binary SIFT descriptor;color and exposure information;Hamming distance","Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Color;Hamming distance;Image matching;Computer vision;Electrical engineering","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image matching;transforms","image matching;matching efficiency;merely image brightness information;matching performance;color information;exposure information;128-D SIFT descriptor;256-bit binarized SIFT descriptor;matching procedure;matching speed;binary SIFT matching method","","1","","17","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We therefore believe that prosodic information in the speech signal could be used to facilitate speech processing more directly. The prosodic word, a perceptually identifiable unit which is usually slightly larger in size than lexical word, can be a possible alternative to help locate important information in speech. Acoustic analysis across labels of perceived prosodic highlighted part in prosodic words and semantic foci in words are compared. The results demonstrate that prosodic highlights occur before targeted key information and function as advanced prompts to outline upcoming sematic foci ahead of time. Semantic saliency of targeted words are thus enhanced beforehand while correct anticipation can be facilitated prior to detailed lexical processing. Further automatic identification approach of key content by prosodic features also shows the possibility to retrieve important information through prosodic words. We believe the results demonstrate that not all information is equally important in speech, locating information center is the key to speech communication, and the contribution of prosody is critical.","2472-7695","978-1-5386-3333-5","10.1109/ICSDA.2017.8384443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8384443","prosodic word;acoustic analysis;semantic foci;prosodic highlight;speech understanding;bypass ASR","Semantics;Acoustics;Indexes;Standardization;Linguistics;Task analysis","acoustic signal processing;speech recognition","automatic speech recognition;semantic saliency;semantic foci;acoustic analysis;perceptually identifiable unit;ASR alternative;speech communication;prosodic features;perceived prosodic highlighted part;prosodic word;prosodic information;important textual information;information center;prosodic cues","","1","","18","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Until now most of related features to emotional states are not yet found. The purpose of this paper is to propose a feature selection method which have the ability to find most related features with linear or non-linear relationship with the emotional state. Most of the previous studies used either correlation between acoustic features and emotions as for feature selection or principal component analysis (PCA) as a feature reduction method. These traditional methods does not reflect all types of relations between acoustic features and emotional state. They only can find the features which have a linear relationship. However, the relationship between any two variables can be linear, nonlinear or fuzzy. Therefore, the feature selection method should consider these kind of relationship between acoustic features and emotional state. Therefore, a feature selection method based on fuzzy inference system (FIS) was proposed. The proposed method can find all features which have any kind of above mentioned relationships. Then A FIS was used to estimate emotion dimensions valence and activations. Third FIS was used to map the values of estimated valence and activation to emotional category. The experimental results reveal that the proposed features selection method outperforms the traditional methods.","2472-7695","978-1-5386-3333-5","10.1109/ICSDA.2017.8384453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8384453","Acoustic features;Feature selection;Feature reduction;Speech emotion recognition;Emotion dimensions;Real-time recognition;Fuzzy inference system","Feature extraction;Acoustics;Emotion recognition;Speech recognition;Correlation;Fuzzy logic;Real-time systems","correlation methods;emotion recognition;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;principal component analysis;speaker recognition","speech-to-speech translation system;speaker emotional state;feature selection method;acoustic features;feature reduction method;speech emotion recognition;principal component analysis;fuzzy inference system","","2","","16","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing reconstruction algorithms have wrong and missed election in the choice of atoms, resulting in the limitation of final estimation accuracy. In view of this problem, this paper considers the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system and proposes a novel delay estimation algorithm based on Backtracking Gradient Descent (BGD). Firstly, the algorithm establishes a sparse representation model of channel impulse response. Secondly, it proves that the sensing matrix satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Thirdly, the minimization of the inequality constraint 0 l norm is rewritten as the 2 l norm and the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm is derived. Then, the backtracking mechanism is introduced and the BGD algorithm is proposed. Finally, it obtains the unbiased delay estimation with the one by one correspondence between the delay value and the complex fading coefficient of sparse coefficient vector. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has much higher estimation accuracy than the Root-Music algorithm. At the same time, compared with the GD algorithm, the performance is greatly improved at the expense of little complexity increase.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789200","Sparse reconstruction;Delay estimation;Backtracking;Gradient descent","Delay estimation;Sparse matrices;Signal processing algorithms;Estimation;Sensors;Time-domain analysis","backtracking;fading channels;gradient methods;matrix algebra;minimisation;OFDM modulation;signal reconstruction;signal representation","delay estimation algorithm;backtracking gradient descent;sparse representation model;channel impulse response;backtracking mechanism;BGD algorithm;unbiased delay estimation;delay value;sparse coefficient vector;time delay estimation;wireless positioning;single snapshot;low signal-to-noise ratio;sparse reconstruction method;restricted isometry property;gradient descent algorithm;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication system;inequality constraint 0 l norm minimization","","","","19","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a method to estimate human voice fundamental frequency in polyphonic music signal using tandem filter. There are three-stage filters in this method. At first stage, it's easier to extract human voice fundamental frequency if a singing voice separation preprocessing is obtained. This paper uses the robust principal component analysis to roughly extract the human voice from polyphonic music signal. At the second stage, it is believed that although the human voice spectrogram is reserved and the accompaniment effect is reduced, there is still noise or false fundamental frequency. Thus, a hyper-Fourier Transform is implemented to lower the noise. At the third stage, the STFT spectrogram have the original information of the melody frequency structure.

However, in model checking with SPIN, it is difficult to implement quicksort using Promela. Regular recursion-based implementations are not suitable for Promela due to the lack of function definition. Even Promela does not have stack in its data structures, increasing the difficulty to do quicksort. This paper proposes a variation of quicksort for Promela without using recursion and stack. The variation of quicksort can be applied to SPIN-based model checking requiring a quicksort algorithm. Other computer programs can also use this variation, if recursion, function definition and stack are not available or banned.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789311","algorithm;model checking;Promela;verification;software engineering","Model checking;Conferences;Sorting;Software algorithms;Software engineering","data structures;formal verification;sorting","quicksort algorithm;Promela;SPIN-based model checking;recursion-based implementations;software development;data structures","","","","14","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the Internet network protocol of ""best effort"" service, it cannot provide excellent quality of service for voice transmission. The network end-to-end delay, jitter and packet loss will seriously affect the voice quality at the receiver. In order to reduce the damage of speech quality caused by delay jitter, this paper proposes a new jitter buffer algorithm based on the Atzori's algorithm, in which the E-model is used to evaluate speech quality at the user level. Then it combines the statistical distribution to the delay modeling, and improves the speech collection of Atzori's algorithm to avoid the statistical error which regards the optimal delay of the last talkspurt as the buffer delay of the current talkspurt. Finally, it finds the balance between delay and packet loss, and searches for the optimal speech quality to set the buffer size. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm would significantly improve the speech quality compared with Atzori's algorithm in wired unidirectional network and wireless bi-directional network.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789284","VOIP;E Model;speech quality;jitter buffer","Delays;Jitter;Packet loss;Prediction algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Receivers","delays;Internet;Internet telephony;jitter;protocols;quality of service;speech codecs;speech coding","jitter buffering algorithm;E-MODEL optimized speech quality;IP technology;Internet network protocol;best effort service;voice transmission;network end-to-end delay;packet loss;voice quality;delay jitter;Atzori's algorithm;delay modeling;speech collection;optimal delay;buffer delay;optimal speech quality;buffer size","","","","15","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the structural characteristics of L5 signal, this paper proposes a fast acquisition method based on the folded single pilot component, which can effectively overcome the Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) energy loss caused by the polarity reversal of NH codes.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789098","GPS L5 signal;NH code;acquisition;folding","Global Positioning System;Global navigation satellite system;Ions;Energy loss;Signal to noise ratio;Correlation;Meetings","codes;Global Positioning System;radio receivers;signal detection","fast acquisition method;folded single pilot component;NH codes;fast acquisition algorithm;GPS L5 signal;civilian signal;GPS modernization;message format;data transmission;navigation signal;PRN code transmission rate;cross ambiguity function energy loss","","2","","18","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the linear lambda calculus with non-linear first-class continuations, a value is handled linearly, meaning it can be used once and only once; however, a continuation can be duplicated many times. From the viewpoint of the CurryHoward isomorphism, the calculus is considered as dual of the usual lambda calculus without first-class continuation. And this paper proposes an inference algorithm and a system for the type inference. The linear lambda calculus with non-linear first-class continuations is more limited than the linear lambda calculus without first-class continuations. Therefore, the paper manages both of the two calculis using the type inference. It introduces a modal variable in the types to substitute the linear modality. During type inference, modal variables are instantiated.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789062","linear logic;lambda calculus;type inference;first class continuation","Calculus;Inference algorithms;Software;Information science;Computer languages;Grammar","lambda calculus;type theory","linear lambda calculus;type inference;nonlinear first-class continuations;CurryHoward isomorphism","","","","21","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, self-balancing control occupies a large proportion in the whole design process. In order to enhance the efficiency of whole process, research has been made on this part. First, mechanical modeling for this system was built in transient equilibrium. Then PID control and sliding mode control were used respectively to realize self balance with controlling the swing angle of the upright vehicle. It was shown by theoretical analysis and simulating results that PD control could get good effect, but after system getting steady state, it was easy to produce continuous oscillation. This would make the vehicle shaking in practical debugging. In order to get better effect, sliding mode control was used. And it was demonstrated from the simulation that sliding mode control could greatly increase response speed and restrain the oscillation after entering the steady state. Thus, from the above work, if PD control was adopted in practical debugging, the range of parameters were offered by simulation results; if it was required more stable after entering into steady state, then sliding mode method was recommended. So the efficiency of the debugging process could be greatly improved by the work which provides the direction of theoretical method and the basis of parameter adjustment.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789049","upright vehicle;balancing control;modeling;simulation;PD control;sliding mode control","Wheels;Sliding mode control;Steady-state;PD control;Oscillators;Mathematical model;Debugging","control system synthesis;mobile robots;PD control;road vehicles;three-term control;variable structure systems;wheels","self-balancing control;upright vehicle;sliding mode control;PID control;PD control;steady state;transient equilibrium;debugging process;swing angle;design process","","","","8","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the search complexity of HQ-PAEKS is linear to the total number of the encrypted indexes and may be not in a position to meet the demand of practical application. This paper combines the idea of Public-key Authenticated Encryption with hidden structure and proposes a practical scheme called Public-key Authenticated Encryption with Fast Keyword Search (PAEFKS), in which the search complexity for the cloud server presents linear relation with the number of the encrypted indexes matching the trapdoor sent from the data user.

This paper is aimed at breaking this point and facilitating feature space transformations directed by an intelligent Minkowski Weight K-means clustering algorithm through hybrid dissimilarity measure (iMWK-HD). The proposed hybrid dissimilarity measure assign weights to features based on Minkowski distance and Cosine dissimilarity, which can extend, shrink and rotate feature space so that the performance of WK-means clustering can be improved. In iMWK-HD, a new optimization objective function is designed based on minimizing the hybrid dissimilarity. Using the new objective function, it derives new updating rules for the iterations in the clustering procedure. Experimental results on UCI datasets demonstrate that iMWK-HD is superior to the three existing clustering algorithms, i.e. iK-means, iWK-means and iMWK-means. In addition, the proposed algorithms are immune to irrelevant features in cluster subspace.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789107","hybrid dissimilarity measure;weight k means clustering;minkowski distance;cosine dissimilarity;feature weighting","Clustering algorithms;Linear programming;Weight measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Euclidean distance;Glass","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering","facilitating feature space transformations;iMWK-HD;hybrid dissimilarity measurement;Minkowski distance;cosine dissimilarity;optimization objective function;UCI datasets;iMWK-means clustering;iWK-means clustering;iK-means clustering;UCI dataset;Minkowski weight k-means clustering;intelligent weight k-means clustering;hybrid dissimilarity measure","","","","17","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the simulation, the concept of the wear step length is introduced, and the method of moving boundary key point of the liner region in the model is used to describe the material removal process. The parametric modeling is used to refine the liner layer and then divide the mesh, and then the internal meshes distortion caused by boundary point change is solved.

It has the capability to decompose the PQ transient disturbance signals into a sum of a small number of detectable oscillatory components, removing noise and reconstructing the original signal. Based on the proposed method, transient signals are decomposed into approximate and detail signal. The experiment is performed using PQ long-and-short duration transient disturbances such as high and low-frequency oscillations, impulsive transient and voltage sag. The results of the experiment are compared with multi-resolution db8 wavelet transform.

Therefore, this paper proposes a path-constrained Viterbi algorithm to substitute the use of the state-transition feature, where the core idea involves pruning the paths (or state transitions) that does not exist in real-world data in the Viterbi decoding process. The proposed method is simple but effective. The experimental results obtained for four natural language processing (NLP) tasks, i.e., Chinese word segmentation (CWS), Named Entity Recognition (NER), text chunking, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, demonstrate that the proposed method achieved performance close to that using state-transition feature, and hence saving as much as half the training time in total.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789308","Conditional random fields;Viterbi;natural language processing","Viterbi algorithm;Task analysis;Training;Decoding;Natural language processing;Tagging;Measurement","natural language processing;random processes;Viterbi decoding","path-constrained Viterbi algorithm;state-transition feature;conditional random fields;state transitions;natural language processing;CRF model;NLP tasks","","","","16","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then the electromagnetic-structural coupling analysis method is used to further explore the rail's mechanical performance under the action of electromagnetic forces. The results show that the large scale quadrupole railgun's propulsive force is substantially increased and its current proximity effect is alleviated compared with the small bore concept, while its rails suffer relatively light stresses and uniform deformations.

Simulation results show that different flows have different saturation throughputs due to directional hidden terminals. Therefore, this paper focuses on analyzing per-flow saturation throughput in single-hop directional ad hoc networks. It first derives the transmission probability when taking the three-dimensional Markov chain model into account, then analyzes the collision probability of each flow considering collisions caused by directional hidden terminals.

However, the security of the network storage platform has been a concern to users. Therefore, all kinds of private cloud storage platforms emerge, provide the users with a relatively independent space for personal use. After a long period of use, it is found that the traditional private cloud storage platform can reach a certain amount of security, however, the security is only relative to open public network location.

One way is to use an IP address. In IPV4 networks, each computer is identified by a unique 4-byte number, which is generally written as a four-point format, such as 199.1.35.90. When data are transmitted via the network, the header of the packet will contain the IP address of the destination host. Another method is to use the host name to identify themselves, such as www.yahoo.com, www.google.com. Compared with the IP address, it is more memorable. However, the host name provides little or no information about the host's location in the network. In addition, since host names are usually composed of alphanumeric characters of varying lengths, routers are better at handling fixed-length, hierarchical IP addresses. Therefore, domain name system (DNS) has been developed for converting host names that are easy to be remembered by humans into digital Internet addresses. But the use of DNS sometimes reduces the efficiency of accessing the network because the network environment varies all the time, which results in the transmission rate of information between the client and the DNS server. If the package losses due to timeout, the respond of the DNS server cannot be received. As a result, this paper designs a model that can decrease the probability of these problems by introducing a local DNS database.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789313","Host;IP;DNS;local database","IP networks;Protocols;Web servers;Sockets;Databases","Internet;IP networks;protocols","local DNS database;IPV4 networks;traditional DNS protocol;DNS server;network environment;digital Internet addresses;domain name system;hierarchical IP addresses;host name;destination host","","3","","19","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To study the space charge effects of emitted electrons on the cathode surface electric field, Poisson's equation has been numerically solved for various cathode material escape work in different external electric fields. It has been indicated that the cathode surface electric field firstly oscillates and finally comes to a steady state, and it will take about 0.0003 nanoseconds to achieve the steady state for the diode gap distance of 0.1mm.

Firstly, we divide invalid areas into two categories, including the internal invalid areas caused by reflection and invalid edge caused by occlusion. Then, we use corresponding median filter and mean filter in the different selective areas to obtain the initial restored depth map with no empty area. The edges of objects contain massive information, therefore, an adaptive auto-regressive (AR) model is used to further optimize the depth of the edge area. Additionally, we add the edge information to the sampled image to maintain local detail.

The arousal reflects emotional intensity, and the valence indicates positive and negative emotion. The arousal and valence all have the value in the same range, which is between -1 and 1. In the experiments, it uses convolutional neural network (CNN) in the pre-trained models and support vector regression(SVR). In this model, CNN works as a trained feature extractor and SVR is adopted to train and predict the values of the arousal and valence. Through the predicted values it can be predicted the facial emotion.

To tackle the above limitations, this paper proposes Graph-based collaborative filtering (GCF) model, Weighted Graph-based collaborative filtering (W-GCF) model and Attentive Graph-based collaborative filtering (A-GCF) model, which (i). generalize the implicit feedback to item side based on the user-item bipartite graph; (ii). flexibly learn the weights of individuals in the implicit feedback to improve the model's capacity.

On this basis, the hazard of smoke and temperature can be analyzed and studied when a tunnel fire happens. The diffusion characteristics of smoke layer during a tunnel fire are obtained at different airflow velocities.

For the sake of the line maintenance staff's safety, the high voltage isolating switch draws great attention among the most important power devices because of its capability of connecting and disconnecting the high voltage circuit. However, due to high-voltage isolating switch's working environment, the power supply system of the surveillance devices could suffer from great electromagnetic interference. Laser power beaming exhibits its merits in such situation because it can provide steady power from a distance despite the day or the night. Then the energy conversion efficiency arises as a new concern. To make full use of the laser power, this paper mainly focuses on extracting the maximum power from the photovoltaic (PV) panel. And a neural network based algorithm is proposed which combines both the intrinsic and the extrinsic features of the PV panel with the proportion of the voltage of the maximum power point (MPP) to the open circuit voltage of the PV panel.

The staging was based on the analysis of the stress distribution and the metal flow diagram during the simulation process. During the forming process, the metal mainly flows along the direction of the least resistance; microstructure analysis of the test sample shows that the streamline characteristics of the flange part are distinct. The metal tends to flow downwards after being extruded at the top.

The grid environment is preprocessed by the grid signage method, and the optimal path is selected by the valuation function. The standard JPS+ algorithm for path planning consumes a lot of time in an open list and it costs a great price according to the actual characteristics of the ship. In view of these shortcomings, the JPS+ algorithm is improved in two aspects. One is to optimize the open list with the least binary tree to improve the path efficiency, and the other is to select the appropriate valuation function and increase the valuation function weight coefficient. Finally, the algorithm is applied to the radar simulation system, which has great engineering application value.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789226","Radar simulation system;JPS+ algorithm;path planning","Radar;Cost accounting;Path planning;Turning;Marine vehicles;Heuristic algorithms;Standards","grid computing;path planning;radar computing;search problems","valuation function weight coefficient;jump point search plus algorithm;radar simulation target path planning;radar simulation system;path efficiency;standard JPS+ algorithm;grid signage method;radar path planning","","","","7","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First of all, the working requirements and negative pressure adsorption principle of negative pressure adsorption ship climbing robot are analyzed, and the factors affecting the formation of negative pressure are obtained. Then, under the static condition, the mechanic model of the wall climbing robot with negative pressure adsorption is established. The relationship between the critical negative pressure adsorption force, the inclination angle of the hull wall and the friction coefficient between the wall climbing robot and the hull wall is studied. The critical angle of the wall inclination angle is obtained when the critical negative pressure is maximum. The research shows that the critical angle can guide the low power control of robot operation. It's beneficial for the adaptability of wall climbing robot to the change of wall inclination and wall friction state that the friction coefficient between the robot crawler and the ship wall is more than 0.6. Finally, through the wall adsorption experiment of negative pressure adsorption ship climbing robot, it is proved that the designed negative pressure adsorption ship climbing robot can adsorb and walk normally when the hull wall is in a critical angle. It is adaptable to the different inclination angles of the ship's wall. At the same time, the experiment also shows that the climbing robot can work and walk normally on the wet wall with detergent, and cross the arc of 5mm-barrier.d on the style sheet as illustrated by the portions given in this paper.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789211","Ship;Wall climbing;Critical angle;Critical negative pressure adsorption force","Adsorption;Marine vehicles;Fans;Climbing robots;Force;Friction","adsorption;control system synthesis;friction;mobile robots;pressure control;ships;walls","hull wall;wall inclination angle;robot crawler;outer ship wall;wall surface;wall climbing robot;critical negative pressure adsorption force;ship climbing robot","","2","","11","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a viewpoint that the speech emotion is well performed by the long-time changes of prosody. Based on this, a feature extraction method, extraction of hyper-prosodic features (EHPF), is proposed. The raw signal was processed by down-sampling through the contour established by prosodic features such as fundamental frequency. From the feature contour, a lot of statistical features can be extracted, and the emotion information can be contained in the features set as much as possible. Then the highly related features are chosen by removing the redundancy, which is called the feature selection. In the paper, contrast experiments are conducted on different public databases by various classifiers, such as SVM, GBDT, random forest, DNN and others.

Therefore, if it is possible to obtain the high-quality blocks by analyzing the found feasible solutions, it could be greatly helpful for getting a high-quality solution. In this paper, a novel imperial competitive algorithm (ICA) hybrid data mining techniques (EKICA) is proposed. Entropy evaluation and K-means are the data mining techniques. Since entropy is used to measure the disorder of random variables, the high-quality link can be obtained between related cities to build the blocks by entropy evaluation. Next, ICA provides multiple self-evolutionary countries clustered by K-means to enhance the diversity of population. Through a series of experiments, the comparison result shows that the proposed algorithm can quickly provide blocks with high performance and combine solutions with high quality.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789227","Traveling Salesman Problems;Imperial Competitive Algorithm;Hybrid Data Mining Techniques;Kmeans grouping","Optimized production technology;Conferences;Data mining;Sociology;Statistics;Biological cells;Manufacturing","data mining;entropy;mathematics computing;search problems;travelling salesman problems","traveling salesman problems;combinational optimization problem;EKICA;entropy evaluation;COPs;imperialist competitive algorithm hybrid data mining techniques","","","","25","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the EHS makes it possible to transform an image to follow exactly any specified target histogram through an image intensity mapping function, how to practically choose an appropriate target histogram remains an open problem. This paper first shows that, although the goal of image contrast enhancement focuses mainly on the image edges, the EHS performance is also affected by the image non-edge content. Then it proposes a new edge-guided EHS method that solves such drawbacks. In this method, it first carries out the exact histogram equalization (EHE) on only the edge points, and then it applies the resulting intensity mapping function to the whole image. This generally results in a non-uniform histogram for the transformed image. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very efficient and achieves state-of-the-art performance for enhancing extremely dark images.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789234","dark images;exact histogram specification;intensity mapping function;target histogram","Histograms;Image edge detection;Image enhancement;Lighting;Image color analysis;Visualization;Distortion","image colour analysis;image enhancement","edge-guided exact histogram specification method;specified target histogram;image intensity mapping function;appropriate target histogram;image contrast enhancement;image edges;EHS performance;image nonedge content;edge-guided EHS method;exact histogram equalization;edge points;nonuniform histogram;transformed image;intensity mapping function;extremely dark image enhancement","","1","","18","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional buffer replacement algorithm for disk-oriented database fails to make full use of flash memory as a result of different read-write ways and read-write properties for flash memory and disk. This paper proposes the buffer replacement algorithm for flash-based database based on page weight called DPW-LRU. Based on the data page access frequency, the algorithm divides the buffer into hot list and cold list, and wherein, the former is used to store data pages accessed over two times, while the latter is used to store those accessed for once; at the same time, the dirty page is assigned weight to evict the low weight page preferentially. The experimental results show that the DPW-LRU algorithm is effective and feasible because it ensures hit ratio while reducing I/O access overhead.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789080","flash memory;database;buffer replacement algorithm;page weight","Flash memories;Buffer storage;Frequency conversion;Database systems;Time-frequency analysis;Memory management","buffer storage;database management systems;flash memories","DPW-LRU algorithm;flash memory storage;page weight;read-write properties;buffer replacement algorithm;disk-oriented database;flash-based database management","","","","7","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when extracting the features of the original images as the input in which the neural network is most interested, the performance of the network is improved. This paper proposes two new methods of processing the original images and extracting the feature. One is to add a sliding window and translate appropriate units to center images. The other is to rotate the input image to align its axes to its principle directions. This is achieved by Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to the input image and find its principle directions. According to the experiment results, the problem as above has been solved, and the recognition accuracy rate has improved from 96.66% to 97.12%.

A new denoising method for heart sound signal based on wavelet transform is proposed. First of all, the information signal is transformed by multi-scale wavelet. The wavelet coefficients of each scale indicate a distribution sequence of probability according to the corresponding wavelet entropy threshold to find the maximum entropy of wavelet on certain interval, and the interval is recognized as the leading range of noise. And then, a fixed threshold denoising method is used to adaptively enhance the judgment about absolute value with larger attenuation wavelet coefficients, which can reduce the high frequency sound signal loss and improve the heart sound signal to noise ratio. The denoising simulation experiment is carried out to test the performance. The result shows that the proposed method can improve the output signal to noise ratio of heart sound signal, reducing the influence of noise on the extraction of heart sound signal, and therefore, the noise elimination algorithm has stronger anti-interference ability and superior performance.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789223","Wavelet transform;Heart sound signal;Denoising processing;Signal to noise ratio","Heart;Noise reduction;Wavelet coefficients;Entropy;Pathology","cardiology;entropy;medical signal processing;signal denoising;wavelet transforms","multiscale wavelet;corresponding wavelet entropy threshold;fixed threshold denoising method;larger attenuation wavelet coefficients;high frequency sound signal loss;heart sound signal;wavelet transform","","1","","10","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the improvement of society, safe transportation has become the most important part of daily life. In order to prevent the driver from driving fatigue, the ""Road Traffic Safety Law Enforcement Ordinance"" provides that if the driver drives motor vehicles for more than 4 hours, who does not stop for 20 minutes for rest, the driver will be punished. However, in real life, in some cases, the driver has to drive fatigue, but also because the driver did not rest well, not up to four hours of driving time, but is tired. According to statistics, fatigue driving is one of the most important reasons for traffic accidents. 25% to 30% of the traffic accident is caused by the fatigue driving, causing major accidents. The number of domestic traffic accidents caused by fatigue driving is still increasing. In order to reduce the number of casualties caused by fatigue driving, effectively monitoring the driver fatigue state, in the event of fatigue warning or early warning is an important measure to reduce traffic accidents. This paper analyzes the existing fatigue monitoring technology at home and abroad, introduces the causes and research status of fatigue driving, and reviews several typical monitoring methods.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789117","Fatigue driving;monitoring;development;research","Fatigue;Monitoring;Vehicles;Accidents;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Wheels","accident prevention;accidents;driver information systems;emergency management;fatigue;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;transportation","fatigue driving monitoring;driver drives motor vehicles;traffic accident;driver fatigue state;fatigue warning;road traffic safety law enforcement ordinance;emergency treatment;fatigue monitoring technology","","1","","4","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The maintenance costs of gearboxes are the highest in all wind turbines. This thesis is motivated by the increasing demand for new repair methodologies in wind turbine gearboxes and the need for the monitoring of these expensive equipment. The aim is to distinguish the damaged state data from the undamaged state data. There are several steps to monitor the condition of the gearboxes, including operational evaluation, data acquisition, feature extraction and feature discrimination. The operational evaluation is to justify the performance of condition monitoring and define the damage. The data acquisition is to select the excitation methods, the sensor types, number and locations, and the hardware of acquisition. In this paper, the Welch's method and the principal component analysis (PCA) method are adopted to extract the features. The outliner analysis, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) are applied to discriminate the data respectively to compare with their advantages and disadvantages to others. The results show that the data are successfully processed to extract the features and classify whether the data are damaged or not by these methods.

This paper proposes the framework for dispatching operation of the flexible load based on demand response technology which is adapted to grid dispatch. In the paper, the characteristics and requirements of the regional power dispatch are considered. And regional security and stability operation, transmission lines, and the terminal load are set for the target, the optimization object and the control object respectively. Taking full advantage of the potential of user-side temperature-sensitive load can reduce the load factor of transmission and transformation equipment during the peak load period.

Therefore, it is necessary to design a cache mechanism for some popular videos in advance. To address this problem, this paper designs an Internet application-driven algorithm for centralized cache placement of popular videos in software-defined information-centric networking. First, it designs a centralized control architecture and the cache controller and node working mechanism, and then this problem is formulated as an integer programming. Finally, it proposes a greedy algorithm based on a 0-1 multiple knapsack problem to solve the integer programming and sets a performance indicator to evaluate this algorithm.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as a research hotspot in natural language processing (NLP). However, studies exploring the use of DNN for CWS have not yielded significant gains over CRF models. Thus, developing CRFs for CWS remains a viable avenue for research. This paper proposes two methods to enhance CRF-based CWS. First, a rapid and effective sequential forward selection (SFS)-style method is utilized for feature template selection to balance search performance with search speed. Second, it describes a method for character normalization more robust than the traditional method. Incremental evaluations on the second SIGHAN bakeoff show that the two proposed methods reduce the error by 7.8%, and 10.6% respectively in terms of F-score. The final system achieved an F-score of 0.955 (AS), 0.955 (CITYU), 0.970 (MSR), and 0.952 (PKU), which is comparable to those of the best systems reported in the reference.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789164","Conditional random fields;Chinese word segmentation;natural language processing;feature selection","Training;Feature extraction;Natural language processing;Colon;Task analysis;Acceleration;Automation","feature selection;natural language processing;neural nets","CRF-based Chinese word segmentation;character normalization;conditional random fields;deep neural networks;natural language processing;CRF-based CWS;feature template selection;sequential forward selection-style method;SIGHAN bakeoff","","","","31","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional TTTA algorithms are based on the absolute position information of targets degrade in the presence of sensor biases, which make the position estimates of targets deviate from their true values. Reference pattern (REP), which uses global structural feature of the spatial distribution of targets, is insensitive to sensor biases. However, false tracks can bring extraneous interferences to REP, while missed detections can result in partial loss of the structural feature. This paper, thus, presents a new TTTA approach based on iterative reference pattern (IREP). On one hand, the proposed method inherits the insensitivity of REP to sensor biases. On the other hand, it alleviates the adverse impact of false tracks and missed detections on REP by introducing the iterative process, which refines the reference track set (RDS) dynamically. Simulation results verify the performance superiority of the proposed method.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789166","data fusion;track to track association(TTTA);reference pattern(REP);iterative reference pattern(IREP);sensor biases","Target tracking;Heuristic algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Azimuth;Refining;Radio frequency","estimation theory;iterative methods;sensor fusion","iterative reference pattern;multisensor data fusion system;traditional TTTA algorithms;absolute position information;targets degrade;sensor biases;REP;global structural feature;false tracks;missed detections;TTTA approach;iterative process;reference track set;track to track association","","1","","16","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The steady-state operation of DFIG in harsh environments is affected and prone to malfunction. The stator winding inter-turn short circuit(SWITSC) fault is one of the common electrical faults in DFIG. In this paper, ANSYS Maxwell software is used to establish the FEM simulation model of the DFIG at the grid-connected operation and the stator winding inter-turn short circuit. The paper made the quantitative analysis of vibration, current and loss characterization of air gap flux density distortion in two working conditions. By comparing the size of the characterization, it is determined that the stator current is used as the characteristic factor to reflect the change of the air gap magnetic field of the stator winding inter-turn short circuit fault.","","978-1-5386-5784-3","10.1109/ICCTEC.2017.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789343","DFIG;stator winding inter turn short circuit;flux density;characteristic factor","Circuit faults;Stator windings;Doubly fed induction generators;Integrated circuit modeling;Finite element analysis","air gaps;finite element analysis;machine windings;magnetic fields;magnetic flux;power generation faults;power grids;short-circuit currents;wind power plants","wind power technology;FEM simulation model;stator current;stator winding inter-turn short circuit fault;electrical faults;fossil fuel;DFIG steady-state operation;SWITSC fault;ANSYS Maxwell software;grid-connected operation;vibration quantitative analysis;current quantitative analysis;loss quantitative analysis;air gap flux density distortion;air gap magnetic field","","","","11","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of main reasons why they are not used by practitioners has been said that such tools output many warnings (violations to predefined rules) but most of them are false positive. Thus, there have been studies evaluating violations in the past. This paper focuses on one of such studies, which evaluates violations using their change patterns over releases. Then, the paper examines an impact of authorship on those violation evaluations because a preference of a certain programmer may have an affect on a creation or modification of violation. This paper collects violations made by a popular static code analysis tool, PMD, from seven open source software projects. The set of collected data is divided into two subsets according to the authorship of source file: the set of violations appearing in source files which have been developed and maintained by a single programmer (single-authored files) vs. the set of ones appearing in source files which have been done by two or more programmers (multi-authored files). The results of data analyses show the following findings: (1) the difference in the authoring type has significant impacts on the trends of violations and their evaluations; (2) while important violations tend to vary from project to project and from person to person, about 30% of violations would be commonly worthless across projects for many programmers.","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787030","","Tools;Encoding;Market research;Measurement;Data collection;Indexes;Open source software","data analysis;program diagnostics;public domain software;source code (software)","coding violations;open source software projects;source files authorships;data analyses;single-authored files;violation evaluations;source code;static code analysis tools","","1","","9","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use matrix factorization based on sLDA for topic finding in item-feature spaces, enabling hybrid recommendations using topic distributions and a user rating matrix. The proposed model can learn latent factors for predicting unknown ratings and recommending new items, thus addressing the cold-start problem, as any user can be recommended items that have not yet been provided with ratings.

Identification of performance problems (e.g. bottlenecks) in such environments needs to be done with awareness of this dynamic topology to understand the impact of dependencies among components. A technique is introduced that a) employs expert knowledge to identify bottleneck components using associated performance metrics, and b) utilizes dynamic dependencies to rank problem components in order to facilitate diagnosis efforts.

This research proposes a translation process that applies statement restriction rules to create sentences that can be easily machine translated in order to improve the quality of multilingual translation. It is based on the hypothesis that statement restriction rules meant to improve the translation quality of a given language pair (such as Japanese to English) will also improve machine translation quality for other language pairs.

However, types of such appliances are not various and legacy home appliances are mixed in the real home environment. Most home appliances can be controlled by infrared (IR) remote signals. If we can identify the IR signals, we can collect the control logs of the heterogeneous appliances. Although it is difficult to identify the IR signals due to some reasons such as errors of signal, reception environments, etc. In this paper, we propose an identification method for IR signals with different length and format to achieve a system collecting home appliance control logs. Our method identifies the type of home appliance and the type of command by errors between IR signal from remote controller and each signal stored in database.

On the other hand, it is known that stereoscopic vision is effective in allowing us to intuitively understand 3D shapes and to realize natural depth feel of visualized scenes. It is expected that the combination of these two visualization techniques, that is, translucent viewing and the stereoscopic vision, namely translucent stereoscopic visualization, should be effective for our easier and intuitive understanding of inner structures of 3D objects. However, the cognitive effects that arise when combining these two techniques have not been fully understood for us until now. In this paper, we investigate the cognitive effects that arise when combining these two techniques of computer visualization. We specially focus on medical volume visualization to investigate influences of the luminance gradient, which is inherent in the stochastic point-based rendering (SPBR) that we proposed recently. We conducted psychophysical experiments in which observers analysed the perceived 3D structure based on translucent stereoscopic visualization. The experiments are executed under the conditions of monocular, binocular viewing and motion parallax. We found that the luminance gradient is effective in the perceived depth magnitude in the translucent stereoscopic viewing of medical volume data.","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787022","Translucent Stereoscopic Imaging;Depth Recognition;Luminance Gradient;Medical Volume","Three-dimensional displays;Stereo image processing;Isosurfaces;Rendering (computer graphics);Biomedical imaging;Surface treatment","data visualisation;medical image processing;rendering (computer graphics);stereo image processing;three-dimensional displays;visual perception","cognitive effects;computer visualization;medical volume visualization;perceived 3D structure;translucent stereoscopic visualization;monocular viewing;binocular viewing;perceived depth magnitude;translucent stereoscopic viewing;medical volume data;depth recognition;3D translucent stereoscopic imaging;medical volumes;medical field;translucent viewing;inner 3D structures;complex objects;stereoscopic vision;natural depth feel;visualized scenes;visualization techniques;intuitive understanding;stochastic point-based rendering","","","","10","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional transformation method is the sliding window, and a dataset transformed in this manner only generates the relation between continuous time periods. Therefore, we propose a weight-based data pre-processing mechanism for improving the Accuracy of the massive traffic flow prediction, in which the dataset is transformed by combining the historical and current continuous data. In this approach, the transformed dataset has a certain amount of weight between two kinds of data, with the nearest data having more weight than historical data. Using this method to improve traffic flow prediction accuracy, and applying three kinds of machine learning algorithms to validate the effects, the experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to the traditional one.","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787043","big data;formatting;traffic flow prediction;data science;predictive models","Machine learning algorithms;Time series analysis;Traffic control;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Predictive models","data mining;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic control","massive traffic flow prediction;intelligent transportation systems;traffic flow volume;machine learning algorithm;original time series dataset;continuous time periods;transformed dataset;traffic flow prediction accuracy;weight-based data preprocessing mechanism","","","","24","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a distributed Gaussian mixture model based on Hadoop framework. We use a two-step MapReduce process to implement this algorithm. And then, we deploy the Hadoop framework in the virtual machine to verify the efficiency of the algorithm.

Risk identification is the first major step in the risk management process that determines possible risks in a software project and dictates how effective the risk management process will be. However, there are several approaches used to identify risk. The approaches depend on subjective decisions of risk or domain experts which increase cost and workload. Therefore, to make the risk identification more effective, a systematic and automated approach is necessary. In this paper, we propose an alternative risk identification scheme using knowledgeable ontology representing risk taxonomy and CMMI project planning guideline. The ontology provides the relations among risk factors and software project risks according to the structure of risk taxonomy and the relevant process areas in CMMI. In this paper, we focus and demonstrate the CMMI project planning process area as an initiative to construct our ontology. The resulting ontology is supportive as expected and scalable to handle more on the other process areas of CMMI and the addition of the software project risks.","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787019","Ontology;Knowledge based;Risk Identification;Risk taxonomy;CMMI","Software;Ontologies;Taxonomy;Planning;Best practices;OWL;Risk management","Capability Maturity Model;ontologies (artificial intelligence);project management;risk management","systematic automated approach;alternative risk identification scheme;risk taxonomy;CMMI project planning guideline;ontology;risk factors;software project risks;process area;automated risk identification;software development;risk management process;capability maturity model integration","","2","","14","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These types of inverse conditions are managed in skyline computation. Existing research works majorly apply shortest distance calculation for searching the points of importance and it is assumed that the points are connected without any obstructions.

It is shown that the asymmetric network with nonlinearities is effective and general for generating the directional movement compared with the conventional quadratic model. Second, independence maximization of data is an important issue in computational neural networks. To make clear the asymmetric network with Gabor functions, orthogonality is computed, which shows independence characteristics of the asymmetric structured network without conventional maximizing independence in the quadratic model.

Objective: To clarify the relationship between comments and code quality with CK metrics. Method: Compare distributions of CK metrics between commented files and noncommented files over four OSS projects. Results: Files with comments tend to be more complex than those without any comments regarding CBO, LCOM, RFC, and WMC. The differences in such metrics were statistically significant. Conclusions: Commented files were prone to be complex and thus less maintainable.

The Werewolf game was originally a real-world, face-to-face, indoor game played between a minimum of four players. In this research, we focus on Werewolf BBS, which is a web-based game, based on the real-life Werewolf game. In Werewolf BBS, players can send various messages among themselves, including a wide variety of chat messages and discussions on current affairs. Thus, it is challenging for AI to understand the phrases being passed on by players. The aim of this study is to understand the content of the messages being communicated in Werewolf BBS. In this paper, we have introduce an automatic classification method based on machine learning to categorize the phrases into six groups. Previous studies have used unavailable information that must be excluded when introducing AI to the game. Thus, we hereby propose a method to classify phrases without additional information using a support vector machine (SVM). SVMs are discriminative classifier models of machine learning. In this paper, an SVM is used as a tool for categorization; it discriminates the different expressions shared by the players into the six groups. The results of an experiment confirm that the messages can be classified without preconditions. This verifies the effectiveness of the present research.","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787004","machine learning;werewolf game;automatic classification;support vector machine","Games;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Urban areas;Protocols;Business","computer games;pattern classification;support vector machines","Werewolf BBS;human-interactive communication games;indoor game;real-life Werewolf game;automatic classification method;machine learning;Web-based game","","1","","13","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The abnormal activities in network, sudden increase in price/volume and sharp rise in demands are discovered by detecting peaks in real time stream. To devise algorithms to automatically detect peaks in any given streaming data, formalized ways of peak notation is needed. An unexpectedly large number of frequencies occurring within some certain measurement are called a burst. Thus the nature of peak detection is similar to burst detection in this study because threshold based bursts detection is used. The burst detection is the maximum number of frequency of words per interval of time. The local burst in streaming data means data point which has large and locally high frequency value within time period which called windows. It is also isolated because it has not too many points in the window which have similar values. Not all local bursts are true burst; a local burst is a true burst if it is a reasonably large value even in the global context. Bursts come up in many natural and social processes. It is a challenging task to monitor the occurrence of bursts whose lasting duration is unknown in a fast data stream environment. We present a greedy dynamic detection algorithm which monitors sampling time window size by proportionally the rate of data arrival. It evolves the adaptive methods to adapt sampling time window size and burst defines thresholds to define local burst.","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787006","burst detection;big stream data mining;peak detection","Semantics;Twitter;Real-time systems;Time-frequency analysis;Time series analysis;Monitoring;Noise measurement","data analysis;data mining","sampling time window size;local burst;time stream;peak notation;peak detection;burst detection;threshold based bursts detection;data point;locally high frequency value;fast data stream environment;greedy dynamic detection algorithm","","","","19","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, placing beer and diapers at the same place can bring greater sales for the store. However, due to the rapid increase in the amount of data in this big data era, how to mine frequent patterns from big data has become an important issue. Many approaches were proposed to solve the incremental problem of certain data, but these approaches did not address uncertain data. The CUF-Growth algorithm preventing branches improves the performance of the traditional UF-Growth. In this paper, we propose an incremental association algorithm based on CUF-Growth to solve the problem of incremental updating of uncertain frequent items. This method retains the advantages of the original CUF-Growth, and significantly reduces the complexity of adding new transactions.

So, we analyzed whether cutting-edge software engineering satisfies the needs of developers who belong to small and medium-sized enterprises, or not. We asked 16 software developers who belong to software development companies about effectiveness of cutting-edge researches to their work. In the analysis, we stratified data based on the size of their company. The analysis results suggested that when size of companies to which subjects belong was different, research categories related to subjects' work were also different. However, sizes of companies did not affect evaluation to the effectiveness and the interests of the researches. Additionally, we predicted categories of researches which relate to each developer's business (i.e., discrimination), and the evaluation of developers (evaluated by five grades) to each research, using collaborative filtering. As a result, when we predicted research categories which related to subjects' work, the accuracy was low (F1 score was 27%). In contrast, when we predicted the interestingness to the researches, the accuracy was moderate (Average of absolute error was 1.16).","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787174","investigation;questionnaire;software developers;recommendation","Handheld computers;Big Data;Cloud computing;Data science","data mining;DP industry;project management;small-to-medium enterprises;software development management;software engineering","software development companies;research categories;small and medium-sized enterprises;cutting-edge software engineering;F1 score","","","","16","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed IQPSO-PMLPNN algorithm has three features. The first, each decision variable and each penalty parameter for a constraint of a CGO problem are independently related to an individual network topology of a MLPNN. The second, each constraint has its optimal value of penalty parameter by using an evolutionary process. The third, a normalized and a renormalized operators are used to increase the capabilities of exploration and exploitation for decision variables and penalty parameters with their own search space. The proposed method can obtain a global optimal solution for a test general CGO problem by using the IQPSO approach to optimize the weights of network topology which consisting of decision variables and penalty parameters for a PMLPNN. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach was compared with those of published algorithms, which individual genetic algorithms, artificial immune algorithms and hybrid computational intelligence (CI) methods.

The dominance point model involves AMDS and represents asymmetry between objects through the difference in the distances between the dominance point and objects. The advantage of this model is that the dominance point and points of objects are represented in the same space. However, there is a problem when applying the dominance point to a two-mode three-way distance model (object X object X condition). The dominance point model ignores the order of condition; that is, the estimator of the model is not changed although the order of condition is changed. To overcome this problem, we propose a two-mode three-way dominance point model using a hypersphere. Constraining the coordinate vector of objects on the hypersphere, the proposed model considers the order of condition. Moreover, the coordinate vector of objects has a periodic property. We introduce the majorizing function of the objective function of our model and obtain the estimator using the majorization-minimization algorithm.","","978-1-5386-3302-1","10.1109/ACIT-CSII-BCD.2017.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787008","Asymmetric model;Multidimensional scaling;Majorization-minimization algorithm","Linear programming;Data models;Mathematical model;Minimization;Information science;Switches;Estimation","hotel industry;matrix algebra;minimisation","distance model;objective function;two-mode three-way dominance point model;periodic dissimilarity;asymmetric multidimensional scaling;AMDS;object X condition;majorization-minimization algorithm","","","","15","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Evaluating the relevance of maintainers' internal thoughts is very important for conducting an experiment to evaluate a new debugger. We believe that analysis of such relevance gives us precise explanations of experimental results, which tells how a new debugger supports participants. We are now developing a dynamic analysis to obtain a data that enables us to evaluate the relevance of internal thoughts by a maintainer trying to make a diagnosis. Such a data, called materialized infection, enables us to check if execution points referenced by a maintainer implement the chain of infection to make a program fails.

This specific geographical zone was selected due to the many well preserved, but fairly unknown sites along the lower part of the Danube River and on the border area between Bulgaria and Romania. All results, which are presented in this paper, are obtained during the implementation of the ongoing project 15.2.1.038 ""Ancient roman cultural heritage interactive visualization environment for the cross border area between Bulgaria and Romania"" (ARCHIVE), co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund under the INTERREG V-A Romania-Bulgaria Programme. In the initial sections of the paper we briefly present the international consortium and the structure of the project, its aim and main objectives. The next sections of the paper are focused on the activities for the preservation and popularization of the ancient Roman sites. These activities range from the traditional ground-based photo and video shootings of the selected Roman locations to the use of the modern unmanned aerial vehicles for obtaining low and high altitude photographs, video clips, as well as for the creation of ortho-photo images and 3D models. The paper investigates also the use of 3D scanners and photo cameras for the digitalization and the creation of 3D models of some of the most significant Roman artefacts and the printing of these 3D models as scaled replicas using modern eco-friendly 3D printers. The next section of the paper investigates the possibilities for the use of the created digital materials - for the development of tourist applications for mobile devices, for the creation of electronic educational resources about the Roman history in the cross-border area between Bulgaria and Romania, for the creation of Virtual museums and so on.

The courses use a problem-based learning approach and are team-based. Students are tasked to form teams, define their projects' purpose and goals, investigate concepts of solving problems, and finally implement the most feasible solutions. There are many variations in these courses. Some are offered in one semester, others take place in two or more consecutive semesters. The courses exist in many different engineering branches with a variety of specific requirements. However, the main idea of capstones remains the same: students must take an active role in their own learning and demonstrate proficiency in learning outcomes of their respective programs. In many cases, however, students are not ready to perform well, not because they lack technical knowledge in their respective field, but because they don't understand the major philosophical contradiction between the ambiguous nature of engineering projects and the need for defining explicit goals of these undertakings. This issue creates stress and frustration, not just for students, but also for instructors, who often don't recognize the problem of ambiguity that the students encounter. This is also true in many cases because engineering faculty members are experts in their technical fields, not in the philosophy of engineering education. This paper looks at the complexities of the issue in order to help students and instructors improve learning and reduce unnecessary anxiety.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768604","ambiguity;uncertainty;engineering design;engineering project;engineering method;capstone course;engineering education","Engineering education;Task analysis;Knowledge engineering;Complexity theory;Decision making","educational courses;engineering education","engineering faculty members;engineering education;engineering capstone courses;engineering technology curricula;problem-based learning;learning outcomes;team-based learning;engineering branches","","","","29","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CESI, a French engineering school. This method called ""The Active Project-Based Learning"" (APBL) belongs to an emergent trend of innovative and active learning methods. The APBL approach has as a goal to eliminate the drawbacks of the classical education methods, which are often based on an almost unidirectional teacher speech, an unbalance in the amounts of information exchange and interaction between the transmitter (the teacher) and the receiver (the learner). Moreover, clearly, the great quantity of knowledge flow, the inactivity of the learner, a certain monotony of the teacher speech and finally the abstract character of some scientific fields are critical factors of risk and failure of the conventional method. This is more and more true face to a new generation growing in a digital environment where media and digital tools are preponderant. Consequently, the ""old"" conventional method has reached its limitation. In opposition to the conventional method, the APBL puts the student in the center of the learning mechanism. The learning is based rather on a flexible and dynamic interaction between the teacher and the student. he teacher ensures a role of coaching and accompanying the learner to reach the preplanned pedagogical goal with an easier and a faster way on a hand and with a greater chance of success on the other hand. The student can trust more and more in his capacities and can manage better, organize and customize his own learning process. Organizing studies by project will increase the student autonomy and will set up a similar context of professional work of an engineer in a company. Finally, elementary steps of the project are defined to ensure a continual improvement process, by following the PDCA process (P-Plan, D-Do, Check, A-Act), a widely used management method in industry. These are the great outlines of the APBL method, its expected results and impacts on the quality and efficiency of learning.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768628","APBL;project;pedagogy;method;active;innovative;apprentice","Learning systems;Training;Tools;Companies;Task analysis;Games","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;teaching","unidirectional teacher speech;information exchange;learning mechanism;learning process;APBL method;French engineering school;innovative learning methods;active learning methods;APBL approach;education methods;active project-based learning;information engineering teaching;electrical engineering teaching","","1","","17","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The project coordinator is Nuno Escudeiro of the Instituto Politechnico Du Porto, Portugal with 7 partners across Europe. The central focus of the project is the support of deaf students in education and citizenship. Effective communication is essential to a quality of life and education and both of these should be equally available in a socially inclusive society. However, research has shown that access to education is severely compromised for the deaf and hear of hearing and hence barriers exist to students achieving their full potential. The I-ACE project aims to establish an innovative infrastructure that supports live assisted communication between the conventional classroom and the deaf student and between deaf and non-deaf people. Through this infrastructure it is hoped that better integration and better education will result. The number of people who are deaf or have hearing issues rises with age and, in all age bands, is rising over time. The issue is already a socially important one and is growing in significance each year. Initial research has shown that there are a vast number of different sign languages across the World (approximately 200) with 47 in Europe alone. They have different language origins with only limited similarity. A specific deliverable of the project will be an automatic bi-directional translation between sign language and written speech across 6 different languages (Portuguese, Slovenian, Greek, German, Cyprus and UK sign languages). This paper introduces the rationale, aims and objectives of the project and presents some of the results of the initial desk research into the number of deaf individuals and the issues students and young citizens face.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768723","Disabled Students;Student Support;Deaf;European Project;Sign Language","Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Auditory system;Education;Europe;Avatars;Tools","computer aided instruction;handicapped aids","International Assisted Communications;project coordinator;Instituto Politechnico Du Porto;deaf student;socially inclusive society;I-ACE project;live assisted communication;nondeaf people;hearing issues;deaf individuals;education project;EU funded project;sign languages;language origins;Portuguese sign languages;Slovenian sign languages;Greek sign languages;German sign languages;Cyprus sign languages;UK sign languages","","2","","14","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Massive open online courses (MOOC) and online teaching are offered by a growing number of universities all over the world. These courses are free to attend and everyone worldwide - presupposed the technical needs are fulfilled - can watch these lectures online. These courses are mainly meant to inform and train people in a certain topic in the field of arts, these courses may not work for technical topics, surely not for beginners. In order to achieve success and to learn from mistakes, beginners need a certain level of have to be trained and their success has to be monitored by a trainer. MOOCs may not be the most suitable way for universities to teach their students using distance learning. Online courses, using a web platform where students can watch videos of lectures, fulfill tasks and submit work to be graded online are very common and some of the problems existing using MOOCs can be solved. What́s left is the direct, immediate communication with trainers or lecturers which can be provided during an on-site lecture in the laboratory. By doing the online lectures synchronous, meaning both, the students and the lecturer, are online at the same time using an online conference tools, the students can interact with the lecturer immediate when a problem occurs. These tools have been used by some universities for a couple of years and have proven successful. A new challenge evolves, when it comes to team-teaching, especially if the lecturers are not at the same location. This paper shows some ways of teaching online which have proven successful and efficient and how the special task of synchronous online team teaching can be solved.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768712","eLearning;distance learning;collaboration;online teaching","Tools;Software;Servers;Videos;Task analysis;Training","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;Internet;teaching","MOOC;online courses;on-site lecture;online lectures;online conference tools;synchronous online team teaching;collaborative synchronous online teaching;distance learning;web platform","","1","","6","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With a focus on Electrical and Information Engineering, the project explored academic programme governance issues across the consortium and proposed models for ways in which curricula can be specified to help ensure the detail of the programme can be easily understood by others. The project also established a set of fully developed curricula for the ICT Securities and Renewable Energies at the First and Second Cycle Degree levels. Finally the project developed an extensive online resource for the support of students with disabilities. All three of these project `threads' combine to provide a solid foundation for teaching collaborations across Europe especially those which have, as an integral component, a transnational student mobility. The resources created together lay down a suggested academic programme in the two technical areas considered but also as a model that can be used in other technical areas; and also to `level the playing field' of student engagement - opening programmes up for students who need additional support.

There is a strong push towards funding research that improves EU in one way or another. Thus there is paradigm shift from design and implementation to effect of exploitation and dissemination activities in new projects, even in the design phase.In this paper, we will discuss different dissemination and exploitation strategies, which cover standard objectives such as supporting the development of education, social and cultural activities including sports and the intention to reach out large target audiences. We will also discuss different modern methodologies for meaningful exploitation and dissemination of successful projects, such as User centric approach [1] and waterfall model. In user centric approach there are two processes: the design process and the research process. The user is actively involved in this approach. The user centric approach is depicted using a 7 step model, in which there are three groups directly connected to processes of the corresponding project. We will describe and discuss the various steps and how they can be followed, as well as the major groups such as end-users, problem/project domain specialists, and technology developers responsible for project successful exploitation and dissemination of the project in the paper. In case of waterfall model the seven steps are one after the other. All the input from the end user is collected in the initial stage of the project and the researchers look into the state of art, and finally propose the design where end user requirements are met. It is then followed by the implementation phase. All these phases will be discussed in the paper. The exploitation and dissemination strategies in these two models are different. The user centric model involves users at every step and preliminary results are shared with them, whereas in the waterfall model uses iterative approach for the processes. It will include exploitation strategies used in successful projects for example, Crop, Livestock and Forests Integrated System for Intelligent Automation, Processing and Control in Arable and Livestock Farms, and Forests- (CLAFIS FP7 project), Crop & Livestock Intelligent Integrated Solution for for Monitoring, Control and Marketability of Agribusiness Data and Resources (CALIS-Eurostars project).","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768687","Exploitation strategy;Protection rights;Dissemination activities;User centric approach and waterfall model","Agriculture;Europe;Forestry;Prototypes;Education;Testing;Automation","agriculture;information dissemination;sport;user interfaces","European Union research projects;dissemination activities;design phase;cultural activities;end user requirements;dissemination strategies;user centric model;iterative approach;CLAFIS FP7 project;CALIS-Eurostars project;user centric approach","","","","15","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In spite of this, a number of students cheat. The most common and easily detectable form is plagiarism, where someone else's work is copied across and claimed as one's own.Experience suggests that about 30% of the class might be plagiarizing, though some research point to as much as 70% cheating in various forms. Dealing with plagiarism is a highly time-consuming affair. Prior research observed high value low frequent assignments as the most plagiarized as opposed to low value high frequent ones. It is therefore desirable to have low value high frequent assignments so as to reduce plagiarism incidents, thereby reducing the time spent on dealing with detected plagiarism cases.This paper discusses the implementation of an automated assignment generation and marking framework that is able to deliver high frequent assignments and automatically grade the submitted solutions. More importantly, the framework supports personalized assignments so that every student gets a different problem set to solve. This means that blindly copying answers from another student will not help gain any mark.The paper briefly shares some of the experience using the framework in engineering and science, where staff and students felt positively about the system and observed a huge reduction in plagiarism incidents. The reduction in the incidents resulted in saving a large amount of time that would have otherwise been spent on dealing with the incidents.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768680","academic integrity;automated assignments;automated marking;plagiarism.","Plagiarism;Web services;HTML;Contracts;Tools;Education","computer crime;educational administrative data processing;educational institutions","plagiarism incidents;automated assignment generation;marking framework;plagiarism mitigation;academic institutions;academic integrity;plagiarism cases detection","","","","12","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It allows levels of effectiveness in this modern and global era. This study integrates technology in the learning process and evaluation of its various outcomes. The present paper deals with the planning and execution of a lighting design project to be implemented in several monuments and has as main objective the creation and/or replacement of the existing light fixtures with more efficient ones. The lighting systems are intended to illuminate monuments in order to ensure adequate visibility and comfort. The luminous efficiency of a luminary has a dominant influence on the energy consumption and, consequently, in maintenance costs and use of lighting. The project involved the lighting design of monuments or buildings considered relevant or of public interest with the purpose of enhancing their beauty, making them more attractive to the onlookers. A reinforcement of learning applied to the historical monuments lighting configurations will be described. The aim of the projects is also to demonstrate that LED technology allows for greater energetic efficiency in lighting design of monuments. The inherent advantages of replacing the existing solution with one that provides better energy performance will lead to a future reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), creating an environmentally friendly installation. The challenge was to design a computer aided lighting project using the problem based learning model. With software such as the Dialux computer program, it is possible to analyze the advantage of using correct floodlighting and to understand how software tools can be useful in lighting engineering projects.

Such simulations are useful when solving signal integrity issues in todays high-speed electronic circuits where interconnects play an important role. On conditions of continuing increase of the frequency of signals to be transferred, the real interconnects are modelled as transmission lines. Then, in case of sufficiently high frequency band, additional losses caused mostly by a skin effect exist. Two basic approaches can be considered for the simulation, based on either the Laplace-domain or time-domain formulations of fractional telegraph equations, and both accompanied by proper numerical techniques. The methods are intended to be utilized for both research and education, while respective Matlab language programs can be utilized for PC exercises.

This study uses a Varge multi-institution longitudinal dataset, the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) to examine engineering student outcomes in the USA. This work considers undergraduate student outcomes for women and men in EE and compares them to those in the other four largest engineering disciphnes in the USA: Chemical (ChE), Civil (CVE)? Mechanical (MCE), and Industrial (ISE) Engineering. This research focuses on over 94,000 men and 24,000 women who ever enrolled in one of these five disciplines. This includes first-time-in-college as well as transfer students. Analysis shows that EE has fewer women than men at enrollment and graduation and the percentage of women is comparable to MCE but lower than the other engineering disciplines. Students graduate in EE in six years at lower rates than ISE, CVE, and MCE and comparable rates to ChE. Women in EE graduate at slightly higher rates than men. Stickiness is the number of students who graduate in a major divided by the number who ever declared that major. EE has the lowest stickiness of the disciplines studied. In comparing the net population change of students from start to graduation, EE loses about 22% of the women and men. Only ChE has higher percentage losses. MCE has comparable losses, CVE loses about 10% of its student population and ISE gains students from start to graduation. This work contributes to the literature by examining engineering students disaggregated by gender, discipline, and entry point.

In the last years, the educational institutions are trying to keep up with the pace of the leading ICT companies and are constantly introducing all newly developed devices, systems and technologies in their teaching processes. Despite these measures for constant improvement, many students are still more interested in the entrainment possibilities and not in the educational enhancements, which are provided by the modern technologies. This has presented the need to combine the entertainment and the education, so that both processes can be blended into one. There are many examples of such solutions - from the integration of educational content in different TV and radio entertainment programs or series to the development of toys, board and card games, which have primary or secondary educational value. In the last years, the 3D technologies have made huge progress and are now considered as the most perspective among the emerging solutions that would have impact on the educational process - both for the teachers and the learners. For this reason, in this paper we present a methodology for development of educational games in 3D environments, which are based on real locations, objects and artefacts. The presented methodology follows every step of the development process - from the digitalization of the locations and the objects, through the processing of the obtained data and finally the actual development of the 3D games using the modern gaming engines. The paper provides also some advices on how to obtain high-quality 3D models of real objects and locations, based on their size and type and using different digitalization methods. An actual example about the use of the 3D technologies for the development of an educational virtual reality game for popularisation of the ancient Roman cultural and historical heritage, which was developed following an international project, is also presented in the last part of the paper.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768721","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;3D scanners;3D reconstruction;ortophotography;archaeological sites;cultural-historical heritage;virtual reality;educational games","Three-dimensional displays;Games;Solid modeling;Surface treatment;Education;Image reconstruction;Cameras","computer aided instruction;cultural aspects;educational institutions;entertainment;serious games (computing);teaching;virtual reality","modern gaming engines;high-quality 3D models;communication technologies;educational systems;educational institutions;teaching processes;educational enhancements;educational content;radio entertainment programs;card games;educational value;educational process;ICT companies;educational virtual reality games;historical heritage","","","","9","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In 2013, the programme of the Network and Telecommunication speciality [4] was modernised in this way to :1) introduce project management aspects with 20 hours of lectured training and 30 hours per student of personal work; 2) take into account high-level programming languages and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, ...): 60 hour training must cover the basic algorithmic principles (procedural programming using Python language) but also the operating principles of the applications letting clients query server services. In this paper, we propose to describe the pedagogical approach we adopt to combine these two goals: students work in pairs for 12 weeks and experiment the programming process by developing a game (namely the Battleship) with given technical specifications. This approach offers two major learning points: gaining skills on programming: students are motivated with a fun basic application [3]. Then they are invited to add gaming options with respect to their abilities and with increasing programming complexity (including graphical interface or network gaming service); placing students in a professional situation: student work is driven by well-documented functional specifications and demonstrator programs. Specifications split the project development into four stages with fixed deadlines. Students are in charge of work assignment using classical project management tools and professional collaborative work systems (Gantt diagram and Subversion source version control system [1]). The proposed project is detailed based on our three-year teaching experience focusing on the pedagogical progression, the advantages of IT project management tools and the skills learned by students after this first practical experience.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-0907-7","10.1109/EAEEIE.2017.8768727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768727","","Programming profession;Games;Training;Documentation;Project management;Python","computer based training;computer science education;educational courses;human factors;professional aspects;project management;Python;serious games (computing);teaching;telecommunication computing;telecommunication engineering education","lectured training;personal work;account high-level programming languages;procedural programming;programming process;given technical specifications;fun basic application;gaming options;programming complexity;graphical interface;placing students;student work;demonstrator programs;project development;work assignment;classical project management tools;professional collaborative work systems;three-year teaching experience;IT project management tools;project management skills;game programming;engineering training programmes;training competent graduates;management requirements;entrepreneurial skills;work experience;undergraduate technical degrees;two-year training programmes;academic degrees;technical specialities;time 20.0 hour;time 60.0 hour;time 12.0 week;time 30.0 hour","","","","8","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ICTs widen the possibilities of uses, at a relatively low cost; therefore, additional measures need to be taken in terms of methodologies to implement flexible learning processes, at their own special pace. The possibility of performing real life experiments is essential to consolidate concepts taught in theoretical classes of scientific and technical curricular units. Real labs are seldom available, posing restrictions to learning and experimentation. New internet-based technologies can be used to improve the access to these experiences using laboratories with simulated experiments. This paper aims at presenting the development of a prototype using tools to create virtual learning environments. It uses virtual experimentation to perform laboratory practices and as an alternative tool to meet the needs of access to a Measurement and Instrumentation laboratory. The basis of the project was the creation of a 3D laboratory where all the equipment and its components may be observed and manipulated and virtual experimentation was chosen to facilitate all laboratory practices. A creative tool or authoring tool was used for the development of the program called ""VEMA"" -Virtual Electric MAnual. The use of WireFusion 5.0 ® authoring tool and an educational license explain the low cost of construction of the virtual reality (VR) program. This project was developed to demonstrate how a VR desktop prototype may be applied to an engineering curricular unit and also to increase safety and resourcefulness in the use of electrical equipment. From the educational point of view, VEMA should not be seen as a substitute of traditional teaching methods, but only as a complementary resource that can meaningfully improve students' understanding and motivation. The main objective of VEMA was to develop a prototype of a VR simulator to demonstrate the potential benefits of combining virtual reality to improve learning and measurement of electrical circuits in a specific controlled environment.

Most games are developed without taking into account the accessibility for people with visual disabilities. Despite all efforts to promoting equal opportunities and social inclusion of people with disabilities, there are still few computer games taking into account the accessibility for the blind. The Game2Senses project intends to reduce the social barriers between the blind community and those not suffering from visual disabilities. It aims to increase the quantity, variety and quality of computer games for the visually impaired. This will be achieved by developing a multiplayer game for mobile devices that requires players to interact. It uses 3D auditory experiences and haptic feedback as ways for primary stimuli. It also provides a basic graphic interface to motivate individuals to play since we aim the game to be played by visually impaired and sighted people cooperating with each other. The inputs of the game are very simple consisting in only six movements, gyroscope movements and touchscreen movements: click, double-click, swipe left, swipe right, swipe up and swipe down. In the end, the game will be tested to know if a blind can play the game.

In the frame of an international cooperation between French and Chinese institutes, an original experience was performed with Chinese ""Honors"" bachelor students enrolled in four specialties of engineering. Two modules of microelectronics and reliability were set-up. Due to diversity of student specialties, the principle of flipped classes was adopted. It has consisted of seminars that give the background, and of a personal student work for preparing a short report and an oral presentation in English, on the basis of documents on-line. Two parallel sessions of thirty students were organized. Each group has chosen a specific subject proposed by the foreign teachers.

Many universities are now integrating or adopting different forms of e-learning components in their curricula to enhance teaching and learning and facilitate the students' skills development process. Achieving high employability rates has been one of the major priorities for many universities as evident in the increasing use of career advice centers, counseling and supervisory guidance. Could e-learning tools be used to engage students with a skills assessment and reflective process, enhancing their career development and employability prospects? Reflective practice has been found to be vital in understanding one's career aspirations, analyzing skills gaps and engaging with a module or programme. Not many researchers have explored how e-learning tools with reflective components can influence employability among students. This study addresses this gap by using the case study of the MSc Audio and Music Technology programme in the Department of Electronic Engineering at York (UK). This module utilizes an e-learning component in the form of a log and for the academic year 2016-2017, a total of 14 students engaged with this module monitored throughout by students' individual supervisors and programme/module leaders. Using content analysis, the data from this sample were reviewed and this study explores the level of engagement of students with the e-learning tools. It discusses the viability of blending e-learning with taught modules in HE programmes. The findings examine the effectiveness of the e-learning log as a tool for employability enhancement and self-development and career reflection.

A simulation was designed to include several important dynamic diagrams in both linear and logarithmic scales, so the students could see their dependence on the density of acceptor/donor atoms and on the applied voltage. The students could compare a silicon-based P-N diode with a germanium-based one for the same doping levels. An exploratory study was pursued with a class taking a 3rd year materials science course for engineering students which included a section on semiconductor physics. Various misconceptions before and after the activity were extracted through coding the answers. One of the biggest challenges was explaining reverse bias, for which half of the students provided incorrect explanations.

Factually, this polynomial has big number of terms, which makes it difficult to deal with in order to obtain useful information. For that reason, another technique, called the Reduction technique was introduced, for a simplified reliability polynomial. This technique transforms a complex network to its equivalent series and parallel form. Geometrically, a diffeomorphism has been used to change the initial reliability polynomial into a simplified form. Due to this original outcome, we formulate and prove some original results, regarding the “reliability”(1) hypersurface for a given network model, and to find the critical points of the reliability polynomial, which proved the nontrivial compatibility of the system. In addition, we had analyzed and computed the Hessian Matrix of reliability polynomial, and try to algebraically interpret the manner in which the reliability polynomial had been convex or concave, which reveals that the reliability of the system is increased or decreased.

The CR system can be used to prevent the interference with TV channel stations and to use the available TV band in a more efficient way. The CR system needs two main requirements to use the TVWS. The first requirement is the knowledge of the available channels in its location using sensing and database techniques, and the second one is the ability to change its transmission parameters such as the baseband modulation, RF carrier frequency, and RF transmitting power. The proposed design enables the super WiFi system to operate over the TV frequency band ranges from 470MHz to 850MHz, where the RF frequency, the transmitting power, and the receiver gain can be changed to satisfy both CR system and IEEE802.11af standard.","","978-1-5386-4241-2","10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2017.8723001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723001","Super WiFi RF frontend;TV white space;cognitive radio;IEEE80211af standard","Radio frequency;Wireless fidelity;TV;Modulation;Gain;Sensitivity;Baseband","cognitive radio;radio spectrum management;radio transceivers;television broadcasting;wireless LAN","TVWS regulations;super WiFi frontend transceiver;TV white space regulations;cognitive radio;TV broadcasting station;TV channel stations;available TV band;database techniques;RF carrier frequency;RF transmitting power;super WiFi system;TV frequency band;baseband modulation;IEEE802.11af standard;frequency 470.0 MHz to 850.0 MHz","","","","24","IEEE","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper a novel approach for determination the cable parameters is used by means of fuzzy logic (FL). In practical life, same PCF is used to connect different types of data; such as telephone, TV and internet, so, many problems are occurred. When the core radius (a) and the pitch (A) value in addition to air hole diameter (d) are well determined the link transmission will be in optimum situation and low losses in the arrived data. The FL is used in this paper for its smart ability and well controls the transition for the given type of data link. The nature of the data and point to point distance are the main input for the proposed system which will determine the desired parameters for the used cable. Real values were used for the input and output variables to satisfy the optimum cable characteristics with minor error rate.

The stability criteria is the main problem of the quadruped robot during walking with a slow motion gait such as creeping gait.

In this concern, this paper advocates an empirical analysis with the recently published works via a chronological validation. Chronological validation achieved by testing the works on three benchmarking data sets to appraise the causality between their detection outcomes and their limitations. Throughout chronological validation, the tested works have fallen short at detecting new phish web pages with an accessible detection accuracy. High to moderate faults and misclassifications are resulted as implications for their limitations and fixed real-time settings. Accordingly, this paper infers that by elevating the tested models in terms of using new and hybrid features, robust subset of features, and actively learned classifiers; an adaptive anti-phishing model with adjustable settings will be resilient against the up-to-date and scalable web flows.

This paper introduces a two level secure colored image transmission system based on a recently proposed chaotic system, called Nahrain. In the first level, the chaotic system is used as a key for encrypting the secure color image. In the second level, the chaotic system is used as radio frequency carrier signal for modulating the digital data. The paper also proposes two new chaotic modulation methods, each method is designed with different testing types. The first method has seven types and based on single bit modulation. The second method has three types and based on two bits modulation. The nonlinear control laws are used to verify the synchronization of master-slave parts of the Nahrain Chaotic Map (NCM). The performance of the proposed methods is measured using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER) over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. In comparison with Henon and Logistics chaotic systems, NCM showed better results when using Chaotic Shift Keying (CSK) Modulation. In this simulation, NCM achieved BER of 1.2787×10-6 at SNR of 21dB, while the Henon and Logistic achieved 0.0124, and 0.0313 respectively. Furthermore, the results showed that the performance of the proposed single bit modulation methods over perform CSK where most of the testing types were error free at SNR equals 10 dB. Alternatively, the proposed two bit modulation methods can duplicate the transmission rate with few degradation in SNR does not exceed 2 dB at BER equals 10-4 as compared with single bit modulation methods.","","978-1-5386-4241-2","10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2017.8722975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8722975","Two-level security;Chaotic;Encryption;Modulation","Chaotic communication;Modulation;Receivers;Encryption;Synchronization;Image communication","AWGN channels;chaotic communication;cryptography;error statistics;image colour analysis;modulation;synchronisation","discrete dynamical systems;level secure colored image transmission system;chaotic system;secure color image;radio frequency carrier signal;chaotic modulation methods;Nahrain Chaotic Map;Chaotic Shift Keying Modulation;single bit modulation methods;additive white Gaussian noise channel","","2","","12","IEEE","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has emerged as an alternative to traditional forms of identification, like card IDs. Face recognition stands as the one of the most challenging modalities, since it is the natural mode of identification among humans. The Traditional FR methods that based on Visible Spectrum (VS) have facing challenges like pose variation, object illumination, facial disguises, and expression changes. Unfortunately these limitations degrade performance of Face Recognition. To overcome all these limitations, the Infrared Spectrum (IRS) is used in human FR, is chosen due to its inherent nature of being immune towards drastic ambient light changes. This paper presents the design and implement of Human face recognition system based on fusing three spectral images visual face images with near infrared image and thermal images to achieve feature integration in the recognition process and to improve final FR system performance. Gabor wavelet transform is used in feature extraction stage for extracting features. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used in the classification stage. The proposed approach is tested on a Carl Face Database (Visual/ Near Infrared / Thermal) images. Experimental results show that our approach exhibits better detection accuracy for fusion of Multispectral Image (Visual/ Near Infrared / Thermal) than visual image.

Secondly an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) in which mutation is adopted into the PSO iteration rule is used to filter out the subsets of features whose value of fitness is larger than the certain threshold. Then the support of each feature can be calculated by these selected sunsets. At last, the best feature subset can be screened according to the sorted support.

Given two different 3D shapes specified by users, a non-uniform concentration is required, which makes the problem non-trivial. We propose a three-step algorithm to construct a 3D scissor structure. Firstly we generate scissor segments that are composed of a sequence of planar scissor units based on the shape correspondence.

Therefore, the paper proposes a framework to better show 3D shape, which is named as S-LCM framework. Specially, mesh compression which achieves a fast transmission data process, is one of most effective ways. In addition, due to the poor rendering capabilities of the browsers, it is very difficult to rendering the entire model at one time. Moreover, it often leads to the browser crashes that the transmitted model data one-time rendering. Besides, A Dijkstra-based mesh segmentation algorithm is proposed to realize component-wise rendering and lightweight for shape. Furthermore, a voxel-based component repetition method is adopted to detect the repetitive components, so that we can perform matrix transformation to finish repetitive components Web3D visualization, i.e. lightweight for shape.

In order to solve this problem, we provided a Hawkes process based multi-events driven emotion generation method. Firstly we appraised every event and generate the related emotional reaction; secondly, we treated the emotion generation process with a certain period as a point process and trained the parameters of Hawkes process by maximum likelihood estimation with real individual emotional reactions; thirdly, we used Hawkes process to simulate the accumulated emotion reactions.

The proposedment can effectively eliminate invalid target detection frames, separate peer targets and resist partial occlusions. Then, this paper put forward an accurate and efficient appearance-feature matching network model that is inspired by pedestrian re-identification theory.

Next, to reduce the amount of mesh sequence data, the vertex motion trajectory data in each cluster is compressed using principal component analysis (PCA). Further, the coefficients of x, y and z coordinates obtained from different principal components are considered as mesh signals, which are processed by a spectral graph wavelet transform(SGWT). Finally, the obtained wavelet coefficients are encoded using CSPECK. By transmitting data on different bit-planes from encoder, a 3D mesh sequence is encoded into a multi-resolution sequence.

Our system utilizes the segmentation depth information to look for the candidate hand regions, and gets a more accurate hand region with auxiliary RGB information. Even when it is not the nearest part than other body regions, we can also detect the hand region accurately. Therefore we make fewer assumptions about hand detection. Based on this, we track the human hand by fitting a virtual 3D hand model to preprocessed depth maps. We treat this as an optimization problem which needs to seek the parameters to make sure that the energy function can get minimum values. Our energy function combines 3D/2D information with shape prior and kinematic priors, and keeps the frame smooth by adding temporal smoothness constraint. The objective function is solved effectively using Gauss-Newton method.

First, single depth camera as the 3D model acquisition device was used to get the 3D human body model. Then an automatic extraction method of focal features on 3D human body via random forest regression analysis of geodesics distance is used to extract the predefined feature points and lines. Finally, the individual human body size is calculated according to the feature points and lines. The method is an automatic data-driven way. The scale-invariant heat kernel signature is exploited to serve as feature proximity. So it is insensitive to postures and different shapes of 3D human body. These main advantages of our method lead to a robust and accurate feature extraction technique and size measurement for 3D human bodies in various postures and shapes. The experiment results show that the average relative error of feature points extraction is 0.0617 cm.

Currently, most hair simulation techniques require a lot of computation time, or rely on complex capture settings. Editing and reusing of existing hair model data are very important topics in computer graphics. In this paper, we present a spatialtemporal editing technique for dynamic hair data. This method can generate a longer or even infinite length sequence of hair motion according to its motion trend from a short input. Firstly, we build spatial-temporal neighborhood information about input hair data. We then initialize the output according to the input exemplar and output constraints, and optimize the output through iterative search and assignment steps. To make the method be more efficient, we select a sparse part of the hair as the guide hair to simplify the model, and interpolate a full set of hair after the synthesis. Results show that our method can deal with a variety of hairstyles and different way of motions.","2375-141X","978-1-5386-2636-8","10.1109/ICVRV.2017.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8719219","hair simulation;spatial-temporal editing;guide hair;neighborhood","Hair;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Dynamics;Computational modeling;Market research;Interpolation","computer animation;computer graphics;image sequences;interpolation;iterative methods;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;video signal processing","spatial-temporal editing;dynamic hair data;hair simulation techniques;computation time;complex capture settings;hair model data;computer graphics;spatialtemporal editing technique;longer length sequence;even infinite length sequence;hair motion;spatial-temporal neighborhood information;input hair data;guide hair","","","","12","IEEE","23 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That is, patches of two scales are used to represent pixels, the smaller for pixels located at structure edges and the bigger for pixels in texture regions, and then DASM (Directional Anisotropic Structure Measurement) on each pixel is estimated to determine which type of patch to represent it.

This paper proposes a topology and shape preserved lightweight framework of shell models that consists of model analysis, lightweight modeling and analysis, and 3D printing and practical validation in an optimum iterative procedure. Specifically, firstly, both geometric features and empirical features are introduced to construct a frame structure. Secondly, a heat diffusion is exploited to simulate the stress distribution due to two reasons, one is that they have the similar physical transmissibility, the other is that the heat diffusion is smooth, and it guarantees that the thickness variation is smooth and natural without restriction on the degrees of freedom.

Because of the introduction of the global prior model of body pose and shapes into a unified nonlinear optimization problem, the accuracy of geometric model estimation is significantly improved. The experiments on the synthesized data set with noise or without noise and the real data set captured from multiple depth cameras show that estimation result of our method is more reasonable and accurate than the classical method, and our method is better noise-immunity.

Without directly decoded sub-apertures, it is difficult to estimate disparity for focused light field camera. On the other hand, disparity estimation is a critical step for sub-aperture rendering from raw image. It is hence a typical ""chicken-and-egg"" problem. In this paper we propose a two-stage method for disparity estimation from the raw image. Compared with previous approaches which treat all pixels in a micro-image as a same disparity label, a segmentation-tree based cost aggregation is introduced to provide a more robust disparity estimation for each pixel, which optimizes the disparity of low-texture areas and yields sharper occlusion boundaries. After sub-apertures are rendered from the raw image using initial estimation, the optimal one is globally regularized using the reference sub-aperture image. Experimental results on real scene datasets have demonstrated advantages of our method over previous work, especially in low-texture areas and occlusion boundaries.","2375-141X","978-1-5386-2636-8","10.1109/ICVRV.2017.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8719200","disparity estimation;focused light field camera;cost aggregation;global regularization","Cameras;Estimation;Lenses;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Optimization;Search problems","cameras;image sampling;image segmentation;image texture;microlenses;rendering (computer graphics);trees (mathematics)","focused light field camera;raw image;segmentation-tree based cost aggregation;robust disparity estimation;reference sub-aperture image;microimages","","","","17","IEEE","23 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The architecture is based on RGBD images, and it consists of three parts: real-time camera tracking system, 3D reconstruction system and AR fusion system. Specifically, we used a two-pass scheme strategy to execute the AR system. The first pass tracks camera poses timely at video rate, which allows the reconstruction results be updated and visualized correspondingly during the scanning. The second pass takes place simultaneously to handle occlusion between virtual objects and real scene according to camera pose.

This allows us to dynamically distinguish the rate-distortion optimization process of these CTUs and obtain the synthesized view distortion of the VSDE based ones in a high efficiency way. More specifically, a new interpolation-based distortion estimation algorithm dedicated for VSDE based CTUs is proposed such that the actual view rendering process can be successfully avoided.

The text-lines are considered to be one of the most significant features of the images, which are extensively used by a majority of rectification algorithms. However, it is quite a challenge to accurately extract the text-lines of document images with distortions and other disruptive factors, such as non-textural objects. In this approach, we present a general document rectification method based on local distortion representation that is depicted by text-features instead of the text-lines. Specially, firstly, according to the similarity of local distortion, we divide the document image into local blocks. Secondly, a text-feature is exploited to depict the warping distortion of each block by considering the skew angle.

Thermodynamic voltage of FC can be obtained from this state space model and reducing the concentration, activation and ohmic losses from thermodynamic voltage, output voltage of FC can be then acquired. Dynamic model of PV array can be achieved as linear equations of diode current, photo current, reverse saturation current and shunt current as functions of irradiation and PV stack temperature. The output voltage of PV can be obtained by linearly solving current equations. A continuous maximum power output has been obtained using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique. This paper presents DP based modeling of FC and PV module and also simulate hybrid 1.5 kW FC-PV module in grid connected mode using MATLAB/SIMULINK platform.

Nine different versions of standard cell libraries are studied in this chip, basically differing in the device dimensions, Vt flavor and layout of the device. Each library has eighteen test structures specifically designed to characterize delay degradation and power consumption of the standard cells. They are based on delay chains and ring oscillators with different gates, as well as specific test structures for the measurement of hold and setup time of sequential elements. Specific high speed structures (VCO and counters) are included for future high speed optical links chips. The test structures have been optimized and verified using 200 and 500 Mrad transistor models from the radiation working group of the RD53 collaboration. A test system has been developed for the DRAD chip to enable radiation tests to be performed in X-ray facilities.

However, ionizing radiation effects on charge balance termination structure have not been investigated and reported. In this paper, sensitivity of charge balance termination structure to ionizing radiation was experimentally identified for the first time and is attributed to the radiation-induced oxide trapped charges in the field oxide. It was demonstrated that these charges alter the potential at the surface and affects the breakdown voltage of charge balance termination using 3-D simulations. Based on the 3-D simulations results, a novel rad-hardened combined charge balance termination structure was proposed and optimized. The new termination structure is combined by normal charge balance termination, surface FLRs and field plates, which can improve the insensitivity of surface charge induced by ionizing radiation effect. A 300V super junction MOSFET employing novel insensitive charge balance termination structures were fabricated and exposed to Co-60 y-rays at room temperature with a total dose of 150krad(Si). The test results show that the degradation of breakdown voltage of this termination structure is less than 1V with a total dose up to 150krad(Si).","1609-0438","978-1-5386-1261-3","10.1109/RADECS.2017.8696162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8696162","Ionizing Radiation Effect;Super Junction;Charge Balance Termination field limiting rings","Ionizing radiation;MOSFET;Junctions;Radiation effects;Degradation;Electric fields;Microelectronics","MOSFET;oxidation;radiation hardening (electronics);surface charging","surface charge;radiation effect;insensitive charge balance termination structures;ionizing radiation effects;radiation tolerance;radiation-induced oxide trapped charges;novel rad-hardened combined charge balance termination structure;normal charge balance termination;super junction MOSFET;breakdown voltage;equipotential field plates;voltage 300.0 V;voltage 1.0 V;Si","","","","19","IEEE","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The FPGA chips are fabricated in a standard 0.13μm CMOS process and have a volume of 3 million equivalent logic gates.

With a thin buried oxide (BOX) layer, reduction in power consumption can be achieved by applying a back bias from under the BOX. Such power reduction is one of its many advantages and is appealing to space applications. Recently, it was found during a heavy ion experiment that a static random access memory (SRAM) fabricated with a thin-BOX SOI technology exhibits a 100-fold soft error sensitivity when it receives a back-bias. This is due to long line-type formation of multiple cell upsets (MCUs). To understand the mechanism of this phenomenon and the effects of device parameters on it, an analytical model is developed and studied with numerical simulation. On the basis of the model, a countermeasure is also discussed. It is found that the deep n-well doping concentration or resistance plays an important role in the phenomenon and its countermeasure.","1609-0438","978-1-5386-1261-3","10.1109/RADECS.2017.8696168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8696168","Soft error;radiation effect;silicon-on-insulator","Ions;Substrates;Resistance;Random access memory;Mathematical model;Analytical models;Numerical models","elemental semiconductors;integrated circuit modelling;numerical analysis;radiation hardening (electronics);semiconductor doping;silicon;silicon-on-insulator;SRAM chips","numerical simulation;back bias;thin-BOX SOI SRAM technology;analytical model;device parameters;multiple cell upsets;long line-type formation;100-fold soft error sensitivity;static random access memory;heavy ion experiment;space applications;power reduction;power consumption;buried oxide layer;silicon-on-insulator technology;resistance-based modeling;long line-type MCUs;deep n-well doping concentration;Si","","1","","16","IEEE","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At VTT the SolidOpto SPFI-(003)-6G 6.25 Gbps optical transceiver has been specifically engineered for this space environment. This device has successfully passed mechanical vibration and shock, thermal vacuum and total dose radiation up to 100krad. The first SEE radiation tests on this device have been performed and are the topic of this paper. The radiation tests demonstrate that this device is free of destructive radiation events. With a dedicated state-of-the-art high-speed radiation test set-up the BER as well as the SET rate as function of LET and flux could be determined for the optical transceiver operating at 5Gbps. Threshold and cross-section both for receiver and transmitter could be determined as well as the SET pulse-width distribution. The analysis of these results allows the predicted performance of this optical transceiver in space as a function of the implemented transmitted data encoding.

First results suggest that a limited variation of the refractive index of some 10-4 or more - which is easily reached at a few MGy (Si02) dose levels - affect the performance of an optical system (OS), thus the image quality of the radiation-hardened camera. Inspired by the domain of non-cooled thermal imaging where the refractive index strongly changes with the temperature, we also investigated the approach of wavefront coding to increase the robustness of OS to high dose levels of radiations.

Second, the halogen bench works with a white light source whose spectrum is filtered from 400 to 1550 nm. Optical power injected into the DUT is less than 10 nW in a spectral band 2-3 nm wide. Comparing measurements of both benches around 1540 nm allows to reveal photobleaching effect within some commercial optical fibres.

We are producing around 40 000 radiation tolerant transceivers, all of which go through an extensive quality assurance process. The functionality has been tested in laboratory conditions and across a wide temperature range, as well as the reliability of the assembly has been verified in accelerated aging tests. One of the most important parts of the quality assurance is to verify the desired radiation hardness. Samples from all photodiode and laser wafers used in the Versatile Transceiver production were exposed to both gamma rays and neutron fluence. Fully functioning final modules were tested in a complex test setup which enabled us to test all main transmitter and receiver parameters during the irradiation. Samples, both optical components and full modules, experienced the expected degradation in performance but the transceiver modules were able to transmit error free data with required margins even in the end of the irradiation.","1609-0438","978-1-5386-1261-3","10.1109/RADECS.2017.8696160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8696160","LHC;data communication;optoelectronics;radiation damage;neutron irradiation;total ionizing dose","Optical attenuators;Optical transmitters;Photodiodes;Radiation effects;Transceivers;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","ageing;nuclear electronics;optical fibre communication;optical links;photodiodes;position sensitive particle detectors;quality assurance;radiation hardening (electronics);readout electronics;silicon radiation detectors;transceivers","final modules;complex test setup;optical components;transceiver modules;radiation hard optical Link developments;CERN;Versatile Link project;radiation tolerant transceiver module;uniquely harsh environment;high energy physics experiments;electrical components;extremely high doses;ionizing radiation;rigorous evaluation;candidate components;development phase;production phase;selected components;40 000 radiation tolerant transceivers;extensive quality assurance process;wide temperature range;accelerated aging tests;desired radiation hardness;Versatile Transceiver production","","2","","14","IEEE","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, SiH groups densities in silicon dioxide films are measured and compared with interface trap densities developed at different dose rates to evaluate the impacts of direct proton release mechanism on ELDRS by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis with the combined use of gamma-ray and electron-beam irradiation. The measurement results in this study clearly show that ELDRS depends linearly on SiH groups densities. The linear relationship demonstrates ELDRS is caused by the direct proton release mechanism.

Herein, pulsed-neutron experiments are conducted on SRAMs, showing that the upset cross sections differ as the pulsed-state mode changes, indicating the nonlinearity between the upset bits and the neutron fluence, unlike the linear accumulation of single event upsets (SEUs) with increasing neutron fluence at the steady-state modes. To identify the upset pattern of pulsed-neutron-induced upset bursts, the experimental results are compared to Monte-Carlo simulations, which calculate the growing upset bits of different accumulated upset types and simulate the upset accumulation process at steady-state modes. The experimental results exhibit consistent and precise accordance with the simulation results, indicating that the pulsed-neutron induced upset bursts are caused by the same accumulating process as that of SEUs at the steady-state modes. The observed nonlinearity is attributed to the uncertainty of neutron-fluence measurements, uncounted secondary upsets, and some unidentified systematic errors in cross-section calculations. The identification of pulsed-neutron-induced upset bursts with the accumulation of SEUs can convincingly distinguish such upset bursts from dose rate upset (DRU) bursts.","1609-0438","978-1-5386-1261-3","10.1109/RADECS.2017.8696159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8696159","dose rate upset;pulsed neutron;single event upset;static random access memory","Electronics packaging;Indexes","Monte Carlo methods;neutron effects;radiation hardening (electronics);SRAM chips","neutron fluence;steady-state modes;pulsed-neutron-induced upset bursts;Monte-Carlo simulations;upset accumulation process;pulsed-neutron induced upset bursts;dose rate upset bursts;static random access memories;pulsed-neutron experiments;pulsed-state mode;nuclear reactors;SRAM;upset cross sections;single event upsets;neutron-fluence measurements;unidentified systematic errors;cross-section calculations","","1","","15","IEEE","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advantage of using x-ray as a proxy for gamma-ray TID testing is that shielding can be used to identify the most sensitive circuits.

Furthermore, during this investigation we discovered that the most important mechanism causing the failure of RTG4 re-programming is the degradation of the high voltage devices in the high voltage generation and word line access circuits.","1609-0438","978-1-5386-1261-3","10.1109/RADECS.2017.8696120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8696120","","Testing;Gamma-rays;Fabrics;Field programmable gate arrays;Flip-chip devices;Performance evaluation;Current measurement","field programmable gate arrays;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit testing;radiation hardening (electronics)","flip-chip FPGA;gamma-ray TID testing;high voltage generation;word line access circuits;TID tolerance;xray testing;TID sensitive circuits","","","","19","IEEE","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In MDRTDBS, to perform correct transaction scheduling, several priority heuristics with different concurrency control methods are used, so that, it could minimize transaction abort rate. Priority heuristic approaches deal with problem of assigning the priorities among transactions so that it could helpful with concurrency control (CC) mechanism to achieve typical time constraint. In recent few years, the performance of CC protocols of distributed real-time database Systems (DRTDBS) have been examined using different priority heuristics methods. However, very few numbers of approaches have been proposed on priority heuristics for wireless environments. Hence, a new priority heuristic method based on deadline computed by considering write only operations has been proposed for wireless environments. It is improved priority heuristic approach which shows better results than earlier priority heuristics. In recent years, researchers have classified the transactions in two types called as Read only transactions (ROT) and Update transaction. This new priority heuristic for mobile environment considers ROT and update transactions separately. Further, a study has also been done to examine the impact of these priority heuristics as compared with number of locks and mixed method approaches.","","978-1-5386-6911-2","10.1109/ADCOM.2017.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8691940","Priority Heuristic;deadline;Real Time;Concurrency contro;Mobile database;Distributed database","Real-time systems;Servers;Distributed databases;Wireless communication;Concurrency control;Broadcasting","concurrency control;distributed databases;mobile computing;real-time systems;scheduling;transaction processing","optimistic concurrency control;priority scheduling;priority heuristic approach;priority heuristic method;mobile distributed real time database;transaction scheduling;concurrency control methods;distributed realtime database system;read only transactions;update transaction;DRTDBS system;mixed method approach;write only operation","","8","","21","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without proper methodologies / Formal Tools as is the case with most blockchain systems, bugs slip in easily. Studies on failures point to developers missing low handing bugs as most of the errors are simulated with 3 nodes or less [2].

The digital cash and the blockchains of our system can be adapted to models of decentralized blockchains, akin to cryptocurrencies, using proof-of-work/proof-of-stake computational principles. We have recently proposed a new key stream generator based on certain types of collections of arithmetic progressions of integers. Our scheme provides for enhanced flexibility and versatility with respect to parametric choices.We build our hashchains using the integer sequences derived from this collection. We present an outline of prototype development and implementation of certain modules of the VSK chains system.","","978-1-5386-6911-2","10.1109/ADCOM.2017.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8691914","Cryptocurrencies;Electronic Cash;Blockchain Technology","Blockchain;Peer-to-peer computing;Hash functions;Bitcoin;Instruments","cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;electronic money;financial data processing;transaction processing","financial information;centralized chains;auditable chains;distributed transactions;financial instruments;decentralized blockchains;proof-of-work/proof-of-stake computational principles;VSK chains system;currency transaction blockchains;computational system;distributed transactional information;associated monetary payment information;typical organizational applications;conceptual architectural design;content transaction chains;financial instrument transaction chains;denominational digital cash;versatile cryptographic hash function","","","","25","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed primitives are amenable to parallelization and well-suited for hardware portability. The security of these primitives is based on an well-defined hard problem.

This process is based on the inverse Zpinch effect. Interaction of the shock waves generated by the expander with ceramic surfaces can change, for example, the wettability and the morphology of sample surface. In this paper SiC and Al2O3 ceramics were formed by using uniaxial and isostatic pressing method and sintered, respectively, at 1950 °C and 1600°C. The SiC ceramics were produced with additive YAG in proportions of 5 wt%, 7.6 wt% and 10 wt%. On the other hand, Al2O3 ceramics were produced with 0.15 wt% MgO. All samples were sanded and polished by using the same process. The ceramics received an average of 1440 plasma pulses with discharges made at equal intervals of 20 minutes, using nitrogen as carrier gas. The use of this innovative plasma technique produced significant changes on the SiC ceramics surface. On the other hand, the alumina ceramics, that have dielectric characteristics, showed slight change after exposure to a plasma expander.","","978-1-5386-3386-1","10.1109/LAWPP.2017.8692198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692198","Al2O3 ceramics;plasma expander;SiC ceramics and surface treatment","Silicon carbide;Ceramics;Plasmas;Aluminum oxide;Surface treatment;Additives;Discharges (electric)","alumina;ceramics;hot pressing;plasma materials processing;silicon compounds;sintering;wetting;wide band gap semiconductors;Z pinch","nitrogen ions;inverse-z pinch plasma discharge;silicon carbide ceramics;structural coating;ballistic armor;thermal coating protection;catalyst supports;dense SiC ceramics;ceramic surfaces;uniaxial pressing method;isostatic pressing method;innovative plasma technique;SiC ceramics surface;alumina ceramics;plasma expander;temperature 1950.0 degC;temperature 1600.0 degC;time 20.0 min;SiC;Al2O3;Y2O3;MgO","","","","34","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the field configuration a search was made of the possible regions for magnetic reconnection by making planar cuts at places of large field variations. The potential reconnection site is characterized by the presence of a neutral point in the projected field. It is found that these points are not far from the actual site where the solar flare appeared, even though the linear model is relatively simple. This analysis is performed for two active regions with similar results.

Relatedly, this contribution analyzes microwave heating scenarios using the full wave code IPF-FDMC, which takes as input parameters the experimental electron density and temperature profile. This complete analysis takes into account the geometry of the vacuum vessel, the absorption and reflection in the walls, and considers different poloidal and toroidal scenarios.

The study was carried out using mass spectrometry. The mass spectra were collected by a mass spectrometer operating in the mass range from 1 to 300 amu. Plasmas were generated within a stainless steel cylindrical chamber in a plane parallel plate electrodes plasma reactor configuration with 210 mm of internal diameter and 225 mm of length. The chamber is provided with eight lateral entrances, positioned at the mid plane between the electrodes, that may be used for setting optical, electrical and mass diagnostics and the low (mechanical pump) and high (turbo-molecular pump) vacuum systems. The vacuum inside the plasma chamber is monitored by Pirani™ (thermocouple) and Penning™ (inverse magnetrom) gauges. The turbo-molecular pump is coupled to the chamber through a gate valve and is used for cleanness purposes. The pressure is pumped down to $10^{-6}$ Torr, being the chamber purged with argon several times before each running of the experiment. The 13.56 MHz RF power was coupled to the chamber through an appropriate matching network. Mass spectrometry allowed one to follow the trends of several chemical species resulted from diglyme's molecule fragmentation for different values of pressure and RF power. The results showed that for a fixed pressure, the increase of the RF power coupled to the plasma chamber from 5 to 45 W produced a plasma environment much more reactive which reduces the population of the heavier species and increases the population of the lighter one. This fact can be attributed to the increase of the electronic temperature that makes predominant the occurrence of inelastic processes that promotes molecular fragmentation. From the point of view of the nonfouling characteristic of the plasma deposited diglyme films the ethylene-glycol structure, e.g., CH2CH2O (44 amu), is one the most important structure to be retained within the film composition if one wants to keep its functionality as is already shown in current literature. The experimental results suggest that if one wants to keep the monomer's functionality within the plasma deposited films resulting from such kind of discharges one must operate in low RF power conditions.","","978-1-5386-3386-1","10.1109/LAWPP.2017.8692188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692188","Molecular fragmentation;Mass spectrometry;Optical spectroscopy;Diglyme plasmas","Plasmas;Radio frequency;Chemicals;Films;Discharges (electric);Inductors;Mass spectroscopy","argon;contact angle;electrodes;glow discharges;high-frequency discharges;infrared spectra;mass spectra;plasma chemistry;plasma density;plasma deposition;plasma diagnostics;plasma materials processing;plasma sources;plasma temperature;polymer films;polymerisation","mass spectrometer;molecular fragmentation;plane parallel plate electrode plasma reactor configuration;excited plasma discharges;diethylene glycol dimethyl ether molecule;fragmentation process;diglyme plasmas;plasma deposited films;diglyme films;plasma chamber;turbo-molecular pump;mechanical pump;electrical mass diagnostics;optical mass diagnostics;stainless steel cylindrical chamber;mass spectrometry","","","","18","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The control parameters chosen are the D-T refueling rate, the auxiliary heating power and a neutral helium beam. We use a fuzzy controller of the Mamdani type that uses a number of membership functions appropriate to produce a response to parameter deviations that minimizes the response time. The inference rules are determined in a way to provide stabilization to all perturbations of the temperature, density and alpha particle fraction. The dynamical response of the reactor is simulated with a zero-dimentional model that uses confinement times provided by the ITER scaling. We show how the system is feedback stabilized for a large range of parameters around the nominal values. The recovery time after a perturbation from the steady state is within the order of one second even with a noise term added to the energy confinement time. Furthermore the results of this Fuzzy Control System are compared with another control system based on neural networks that was previously developed.","","978-1-5386-3386-1","10.1109/LAWPP.2017.8692194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692194","","Control systems;Inductors;Fuzzy logic;Alpha particles;Plasmas;Mathematical model;Shape","dynamic response;feedback;fusion reactor ignition;fuzzy control;plasma temperature;stability","ITER-fuzzy Sair Garcia;fuzzy control system;plasma temperature;fuzzy logic controller;steady power exhaust;fusion reactor;fuel burn;burn control;energy confinement time;ITER scaling;dynamical response;alpha particle fraction;Mamdani type;fuzzy controller;neutral helium beam;auxiliary heating power;D-T refueling rate","","","","9","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The non-linear island growth is studied in presence of a plasma flow associated with the transport barrier. In previous works it has been found that the presence of a sheared flow reduces the growth rate of the island and is thus stabilizing, when only the modification of the tearing-mode parameter is considered. However, another effect of the plasma sheared flows is to produce a polarization current in the vicinity of the magnetic island separatrix due to the nozzle effect. The influence of this current on the island stability has been computed for axisymmetric systems [2]. Here, we computed it for a non-axisymmetric geometry, as is the case for TJ-II, and is found to be weakly destabilizing. A bifurcation in the torque balance can explain the cycle of the transport barrier formation and island growth with the subsequent barrier destruction. The whole process is modeled using the Astra transport code in which we include a turbulence model based on the resistive ballooning mode. Three impurity species of Carbon are also included in order to obtain the emitted radiation that is measured in the experiments by bolometers.

In Stellarators, vacuum magnetic flux surfaces are produced only by external coils [2], making respective property measurements possible. Flux surfaces allow the magnetic confinement of plasma, making their characterization important to verify the device's construction. The aim of this work is to present measurements on the flux surfaces in the SCR-1. Mapping of the magnetic surfaces produced in the SCR-1 implied the use of a transparent fluorescent screen covered with ZnO:Zn phosphor which allows the detection of an electron beam, emitted from an electron gun inside the vacuum vessel, that travels around the device following the magnetic field lines. Three highly transparent screens were used: a fixed stainless-steel mesh, an oscillating rod, and an in-house elliptical design called “cuchillo de mantequilla” (butter knife); and results were compared between them. Using the three different methods in the toroidal position 0°, three different nested surfaces were measured. Finally, results were compared with the Poincaré maps from BS-SOLCTRA (Biot-Savart Solver for Compute and Trace Magnetic Fields) and EXTENDER_P (formerly Poincare) codes [3], [4]. The obtained results are consistent with expectations, verifying that the manufacturing process of the coils was handled as designed.","","978-1-5386-3386-1","10.1109/LAWPP.2017.8692203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692203","e-beam;flux surface mapping;transparent screens","Shape;Magnetic flux;Magnetic confinement;Magnetic resonance imaging;Electron beams;Plasma measurements","fluorescent screens;magnetrons;plasma density;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma radiofrequency heating;plasma toroidal confinement;stellarators;Tokamak devices","vacuum magnetic flux surface measurements;SCR-1 Stellarator;vacuum magnetic flux surfaces;magnetic surfaces;transparent fluorescent screen;vacuum vessel;magnetic field lines","","1","","6","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the proposed first tasks is to simulate the magnetic confinement considering the particular coils arrangement of the device. This work presents the resulting shape of the plasma cross-section. MEDUSA-CR main specifications are: plasma major radius R0 approx. 0.14 m, plasma minor radius a approx. 0.10 m, toroidal field at the vessel geometrical center BT smaller than 0.5 T, plasma current Ip lesser than 40 kA, central electron temperature Te lesser than 140 eV, discharge duration lesser than 3 ms [1]. The free boundary equilibrium solver Fiesta has been used to obtain the plasma shaping and some equilibrium parameters. The code works the magnetic confinement for the static Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) equilibrium case solving the Grad-Shafranov equation. A central solenoid was added to the original magnetic configuration aiming to create a limiter with an ergodic behavior in order to enhance the plasma confinement [2], [3]. The resulting cross-section (without divertor, i.e., natural divertor) for the plasma volume is a “bean” shape. The elongation is found to be 1.43 and the triangularity 0.547. A bean shape cross section is found to produce a higher triangularity, which have a significant effect on MHD stability [4]. Further simulations with FIESTA could be used as proof of principle for the effect of the plasma shape on transport and stability.","","978-1-5386-3386-1","10.1109/LAWPP.2017.8692190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692190","Fiesta-code;MEDUSA-CR;MHD-simulation;Spherical-Tokamak","Coils;Magnetic confinement;Tokamak devices;Toroidal magnetic fields;Magnetic flux","plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma instability;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma temperature;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes;Tokamak devices","equilibrium simulation;magnetic confinement;resulting shape;plasma cross-section;plasma minor radius;free boundary equilibrium solver Fiesta;plasma shaping;equilibrium parameters;plasma confinement;plasma volume;bean shape cross section;plasma shape;static magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium;spherical tokamak MEDUSA-CR;electron temperature","","1","","14","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the first steps in this topic is building a domain thesaurus. Well approved methods of terms extraction based on word frequencies exist for alphabetic languages. Direct application of these methods for hieroglyphic texts is challenged because of missing spaces between words. The sentence segmentation task in hieroglyphic languages is usually solved by dictionaries or by statistical methods, particularly, by means of a mutual information approach. Sentence segmentation methods, as well as methods of terms extraction, separately, do not reach 100 percent precision and recall, and their combination just increases the number of errors. The aim of this work is to improve recall and precision of domain terms extraction from hieroglyphic texts. The proposed method is to identify repetitions of the two, three or four symbol sequences in each sentence and correlation of occurrence frequencies for these sequences in the target domain and contrast documents collection. According to the research, it was stated that a trivial ranking of all possible symbol sequences allows extracting only frequently used terms. Filtering of symbol sequences by their ratio of frequencies in the domain and in the contrast collection gave the possibility to extract reliably frequently used terms and to find satisfactory rare domain terms. Some results of terms extraction for the “Geology” domain from a Chinese text are presented in this paper. A set of articles from the newspaper “Renmin Ribao” was used as a contrast collection and some satisfactory results were obtained.","2472-8586","978-1-5386-0501-1","10.1109/ICAICT.2017.8687047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8687047","text mining;document corpus;contrast collection;Chinese language;words segmentation;term extraction;domain thesaurus","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Frequency-domain analysis;Minerals;Dictionaries;Semantics","information retrieval;natural language processing;statistical analysis;text analysis","hieroglyphic languages;statistical methods;sentence segmentation methods;hieroglyphic texts;Chinese text;word segmentation;automatic term extraction;natural language texts;domain thesaurus;word frequencies;alphabetic languages;sentence segmentation task;term extraction;precision value;recall value;symbol sequences","","4","","17","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Location finding in a Loran-C system is based on the time delay estimation so that exact delay estimation plays a crucial role in positioning accuracy. Finding the reference point of each Loran-C system emitted pulse is called cycle identification. Cycle identification accuracy depends on many parameters such as signal to noise ratio (SNR), envelope to cycle difference (ECD) and the signal sampling frequency. In this paper, it is proposed a modification to our previous paper to increase robustness of cycle identification against the white Gaussian noise and also two other methods to find the exact location of the reference point of each pulse between two samples. When it is used the intersample cycle identification, high sampling frequency will not be required which concludes low complexity, therefore low cost analog to digital converter can be used in the Loran-C systems receivers.

Processing a large amount of dynamic objects and high percentage of LLC misses with significantmiss penalty are the two key issues in the R execution environment. In this paper, we propose a Partially Parallel Garbage Collection to improve the waiting time during garbage collection; and a centralized memory allocation mechanism to reduce miss penalty that is caused by the high percentage of LLC misses.

This work investigates the employment of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for automatic language identification. The main reason of applying LSTM RNNs to the current task is their reasonable capacity in handling sequences. This study shows that LSTM RNNs can efficiently take advantage of temporal dependencies in acoustic data in order to learn relevant features for language recognition tasks.

In turn, the size of the funnel depends on the filtration properties of coal and the geological structure of the coal seam. Well-developed systems of macro, meso and micro fractures playa major role in the complex permeability of coal seams, including by reducing the diffusion time of gases through the carbon matrix. The nature of fracturing of the coal seam depends on endogenous, exogenous and technogenous factors. The latter usually playa decisive role in creating a secondary permeability. Russian technology of Plasma Pulse Treatment (PPT) creates a secondary permeability in the coal seam and connects the system of natural fracks (cleavage), thereby increasing the permeability of the coal seam over a large area. The estimation of the effect of the Plasma Pulse Treatment (PPT) on the permeability of coal seams is provided in the paper due to the creation of a secondary (technogenic) permeability.","2472-8586","978-1-5386-0501-1","10.1109/ICAICT.2017.8687031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8687031","Plasma Pulse Treatment;Coal bed methane;enhanced gas production;degassing of coal;secondary permeability;3-D modeling;prediction;model;geomechanical modeling","Coal;Permeability;Stress;Solid modeling;Plasmas;Geology;Methane","coal;filtration;fracture;geotechnical engineering;hydrocarbon reservoirs;natural gas technology;oil technology;permeability;rocks;solid modelling","coal seam;Plasma Pulse Treatment;3D geomechanical modeling;reservoir properties changes;coal filtration properties;microfractures;macrofractures;mesofractures;PPT","","","","8","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The semantic model developed on the basis of the method provides visibility and compact presentation of structure of semantic relations between mass data arrays elements. Semantic meta-descriptions are considered as sets of triples “subject-predicate-object” in terms of subject area ontology of distributed operative databases and the query. Authors propose the model to search and estimate semantically similar elements of distributed databases based on clustering of semantic nets represented as graph models on corresponding levels: subject area level, search profile level and document meta-descriptions level. The relevance (semantic similarity) estimation method is based on closeness assessment of data in distributed information arrays of document and query semantic nets. To analyze the developed method authors carried out a set of computational experiments.

Some diagnostic devices, such as Magnetic Resonance, can detect illnesses that may not exhibit any symptoms yet and medical diagnostic equipment can furthermore significantly aid in confirmation of suspected, otherwise undetectable diagnoses. One of the medical fields lacking automated diagnostic tools is psychopathology, where a mental disorder presence is typically established from observations of classified symptoms and structured systematic interviews. The goal of our paper was to design and test a reliable and automated diagnostic method for detection of Schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The proposed method utilizes eye-tracker and Rorschach Inkblot Test to create a visual attention saliency map of observed subjects. These maps are then processed and analyzed using Digital Image Processing and statistical methods to determine, whether the subject exhibits signs of schizophrenia or not. The proposed approach is based on a trained classifier which separates incoming data into either healthy or schizophrenic patients. Of course, these results are only indicative and the final diagnosis rests in the hands of qualified specialists.

In this work, we consider hybrid VLC/RF system which takes advantages of both links by implementing HS and SS methods. In HS, either VLC or RF, whichever has higher throughput, is selected. In SS, on the other hand, data is transmitted though both links simultaneously however the total available electrical power is shared between the links.

Further, in recent years, email spamming in particular has been subjected to an exponentially growing threat which affects both individuals and business world. Hence, a large number of studies have been proposed in order to combat with spam emails. In this study, instead of subject or body components of emails, pure use of hyperlink texts along with word level n-gram indexing schema is proposed for the first time in order to generate features to be employed in a spam/ham email classifier. Since the length of link texts in e-mails does not exceed sentence level, we have limited the n-gram indexing up to trigram schema. Throughout the study, provided by COMODO Inc, a novel large scale dataset covering 50.000 link texts belonging to spam and ham emails has been used for feature extraction and performance evaluation. In order to generate the required vocabularies; unigrams, bigrams and trigrams models have been generated. Next, including one active learner, three different machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines, SVM-Pegasos and Naive Bayes) have been employed to classify each link. According to the results of the experiments, classification using trigram based bag-of-words representation reaches up to 98,75% accuracy which outperforms unigram and bigram schemas. Apart from having high accuracy, the proposed approach also preserves privacy of the customers since it does not require any kind of analysis on body contents of e-mails.","2472-8586","978-1-5386-0501-1","10.1109/ICAICT.2017.8687020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8687020","Spam Email;Machine Learning;Active Learning;N-Grams;Bag of Words","Support vector machines;Unsolicited e-mail;Hypertext systems;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Postal services","Bayes methods;data mining;electronic mail;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines;text analysis;unsolicited e-mail;Web sites","sentence level;feature extraction;performance evaluation;unigram;bigram schemas;e-mail classification;n-gram features;hyperlink texts;digital communication;social media;microblog;word level n-gram indexing schema;trigram models;machine learning methods;spam e-mails;ham email classifier;support vector machines;SVM-Pegasos;naive Bayes method","","4","","18","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TDOA-based methods use time differences of arrival, and ILD-based methods use intensity level differences, both to obtain the direction or location of the sound source. ILD-based methods need accurate measurements and they are vulnerable to noise. In 2D sound source localization, by using only an ILD-based or TDOA-based method, there are needed at least three microphones to find the location of a sound source. However, recently some papers have used both methods simultaneously to decrease the microphones count. Sound source localization consists of two steps, TDs or ILDs measurement step, and after that, the location calculation step. This paper investigates a 2D sound source localization technique using only two microphones by exploiting Euclidean distance matrices theory in the second step. The simulation results confirm that this technique is applicable to calculate the location of a sound source using ILD and TDOA measured values simultaneously.","2472-8586","978-1-5386-0501-1","10.1109/ICAICT.2017.8687037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8687037","Sound Source Localization;Euclidean distance matrices;TDOA;ILD","Microphones;Euclidean distance;Two dimensional displays;Mathematical model;Simulation;Electrical engineering;Calibration","acoustic generators;acoustic radiators;matrix algebra;time-of-arrival estimation","TDOA-based method;ILD-based methods;sound source localization;Euclidean distance matrices application;time differences of arrival;intensity level differences","","1","","5","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
